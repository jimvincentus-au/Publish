<h1>Week 7 Appendix: Tools As Habit, Not Exception</h1>
<p><em>Executive orders, mass layoffs, and curated information flows turned once‑extraordinary tools into routine methods for rewarding allies, disciplining dissent, and thinning the state.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and deepening fusion of crony capitalism with state policy. Trump’s team used executive orders and agency directives to reshape foreign policy toward Russia, hollow out regulatory and social-welfare capacity, and advance ideologically driven attacks on immigrants, LGBTQ people, racial equity, and universities. Mass layoffs and buyouts across Education, Social Security, VA, IRS, USDA, State, and USPS, combined with the effective shutdown of CFPB and restructuring of USAID and IAF, exert major structural pressure on traits 1, 16, 22, and 38. Simultaneously, the creation of a crypto reserve and non-enforcement of anti–money laundering rules entrench elite self-dealing and financial opacity. On the rule-of-law side, courts repeatedly checked executive overreach on foreign aid, firings, workforce cuts, and research funding, modestly strengthening separation-of-powers traits even as the administration retaliated against judges and prosecutors. Internationally, the U.S. moved further away from its democratic allies toward Russia, while pausing or weaponizing aid to Ukraine and South Africa. Civil society mobilization and some state-level protections for LGBTQ rights persisted, but were outweighed by systemic authoritarian drift.</p>
