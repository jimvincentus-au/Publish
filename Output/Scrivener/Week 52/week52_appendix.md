Week 52 Appendix: Occupation as Governance
This week shows an acute convergence of authoritarian tools around immigration enforcement, foreign adventurism, and information control. The Minneapolis–St Paul ICE surge, the killing of Renee Nicole Good, and subsequent shootings are the central axis: federal agents deployed at unprecedented scale, used lethal force, altered crime scenes, blocked state investigators, and were shielded by DOJ decisions and smear campaigns. That cluster drives heavy pressure on traits 4, 8, 9, 11, 41, 42, 43, 47, 50 and 53. Parallel moves—threatening the Fed chair with criminal charges, politicized probes of lawmakers and whistleblower counsel, and the FBI raid on a Washington Post reporter—extend the weaponization of law and security institutions (traits 1, 4, 6, 14, 18, 22, 23, 42). Internationally, the Venezuela operation, seizure of oil revenues, and open talk of invading or annexing Greenland, backed by tariffs and NATO-skeptical rhetoric, reveal an expansionist, transactional foreign policy that fuses crony capitalism with militarized leverage (traits 1, 10, 38, 40, 56). There is meaningful resistance—state lawsuits, ACLU class actions, congressional field hearings, impeachment articles, and mass protests—but these operate as reactive brakes against a rapidly consolidating executive-centered regime.
