The report criticizes the Saudi government's efforts to obstruct the investigation and notes a significant decrease in Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) disclosures. Senator Richard Blumenthal has introduced a bill to address FARA loopholes and urged the Attorney General to reconsider limiting enforcement of foreign influence laws.",
