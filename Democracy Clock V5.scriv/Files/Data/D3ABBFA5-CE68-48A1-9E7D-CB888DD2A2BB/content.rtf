\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 28 Appendix: Law as Central Command\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with emergency authorities and trade tools stretched into quasi-permanent instruments of unilateral rule. Trump\'92s tariff blitz\'97via multiple executive orders and a sweeping de minimis suspension\'97recasts trade law as a personal lever, while courts simultaneously hear challenges to his IEEPA-based tariff authority. Judicial independence takes a major hit: Emil Bove\'92s confirmation despite whistleblower allegations, DOJ\'92s misconduct complaint against Judge Boasberg, and manipulated U.S. attorney appointments all signal a judiciary being packed and disciplined for loyalty. Immigration and detention policy harden into a parallel legal order\'97Alien Enemies Act deportations, Alligator Alcatraz\'92s legal black hole, abusive ICE practices, and FEMA-funded detention infrastructure\'97creating stratified citizenship and normalized due-process carve-outs. Universities and media are squeezed through funding freezes, politicized antisemitism mandates, and FCC conditions on mergers, while Oklahoma\'92s \'93MAGA exam\'94 and federal religious-expression rules weaponize education and faith. Massive Medicaid and SNAP cuts, plus targeted attacks on gender-affirming care and DEI, deepen inequality and mark vulnerable groups as expendable. Countervailing forces\'97federal judges blocking some provisions, state AG lawsuits, congressional subpoenas, and investigative journalism\'97remain active but increasingly embattled.\
