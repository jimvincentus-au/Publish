\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 40 compresses the term\'92s trajectory into a single tableau: the White House East Wing reduced to rubble for a privately financed Trump ballroom, even as millions march under the banner \'93No Kings.\'94 The administration bypasses preservation law and public review, wraps the project in secrecy, and leans on donors whose fortunes depend on federal contracts. In parallel, clemency for George Santos and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a DOJ payout scheme to Trump himself, and the politicized prosecution of Letitia James show law functioning as revenue stream and weapon. Immigration and security policy harden into tools of coercion, from militarized ICE raids and deportations of Venezuelans on debunked gang claims to carrier deployments and strikes near Venezuela without clear congressional authorization. Yet courts, state officials, and civil society mount visible resistance, from sanctuary shields and accountability commissions to the vast, peaceful \'93No Kings\'94 protests. The Democracy Clock stays at 7:59 p.m.\'97no new rupture, but a denser, more contested late hour.\
