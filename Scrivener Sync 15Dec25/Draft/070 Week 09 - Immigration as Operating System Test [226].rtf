By Week 9 of Trump\'92s second term, the shape of the struggle was no longer subtle. The week\'92s events read less like a series of policy disputes and more like a stress test of the country\'92s basic operating system. Immigration, education, foreign aid, and the civil service were not separate arenas; they were the chosen levers for a single project: to free the presidency from effective checks, to narrow who counts as fully protected by law, and to bring the institutions that produce knowledge and memory into line. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 7:52 p.m., moved forward to 7:56 p.m. This four\uc0\u8209 minute shift marked not a sudden collapse, but a deepening of patterns that had already appeared\'97executive power used without oversight, law turned into a weapon, and citizenship stratified by origin and belief.\
\
The previous week had ended with the Clock at 7:52 p.m., a time that already reflected serious strain on rule of law and institutional balance. At the close of Week 9, the Clock read 7:56 p.m., a net movement of 3.3 minutes toward night. The change came from a cluster of developments that all pointed in the same direction. The administration invoked an eighteenth\uc0\u8209 century wartime statute to deport migrants, then continued flights in open defiance of federal court orders. It signed a blizzard of executive orders to dismantle the Department of Education, hollow out USAID and cultural agencies, and give a politically directed \'93efficiency\'94 office sweeping access to federal data. It used funding freezes and investigations to bring universities to heel, and it revoked the legal status of more than half a million immigrants. Courts and state attorneys general pushed back, winning restraining orders and partial restorations. Yet the week\'92s balance of power shifted toward a presidency willing to ignore rulings, punish judges, and treat legal protections as provisional.\
\
The most stark expression of that shift came in the use of the Alien Enemies Act. President Trump formally invoked the 1798 law to expel alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, framing them as an invading force. In practice, the administration used this wartime authority to deport hundreds of men to El Salvador without the usual immigration process, relying on tattoos and thin intelligence as proof of gang ties. The statute, written for declared wars with enemy nations, became a tool for mass removal in peacetime. This was not just a harsh enforcement choice; it was a redefinition of what emergency power can mean, and who can be stripped of due process when the president declares a threat.\
\
When federal judges tried to draw a line, the executive branch stepped over it. Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and, in a later order, directed that planes already in the air be turned back. The administration let the flights continue to El Salvador, then argued that a verbal order did not bind them and that a district judge\'92s authority stopped at the edge of U.S. airspace. Other courts in Boston and elsewhere ordered halts to specific deportations, including those of a Brown University professor and Venezuelan detainees, only to see removals go forward anyway. The pattern was consistent: the presidency treated judicial rulings as obstacles to be worked around, not as binding commands. That is how law begins to function as a weapon in the hands of the state rather than a limit on its reach.\
\
The confrontation did not stay inside courtrooms. Trump called Judge Boasberg a \'93radical left lunatic\'94 and demanded his impeachment. A Texas congressman filed articles of impeachment in the House. The Department of Justice asked an appeals court to remove Boasberg from the case, challenging his authority over flights once they left U.S. soil. The White House press secretary attacked the judge\'92s wife for her political donations and misrepresented his orders from the podium. At the same time, bomb threats were reported against judges who had ruled against the administration, including a Supreme Court justice. Chief Justice John Roberts issued an unusual public rebuke, reminding the country that impeachment is not a remedy for disagreement with a ruling. The fact that the head of the judiciary felt compelled to say so underscored how far the executive and its supporters were willing to go to intimidate the bench.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the main laboratory for these methods. The deportation flights to El Salvador carried not only alleged gang members but also people with no criminal records, including an LGBTQ+ makeup artist whose religious tattoos were misread as gang symbols. A sworn ICE affidavit admitted that many deportees had clean records, but insisted that lack of convictions did not mean they were harmless. Families set up WhatsApp helplines to track loved ones who had vanished into a Salvadoran \'93terrorism confinement centre.\'94 The administration paid El Salvador millions to imprison the men for a year, and then shared footage of them shackled and shaved, as if to advertise the consequences of crossing the border. A senior ally, Steve Bannon, shrugged that if \'93innocent gardeners\'94 were caught up in the sweeps, that was a \'93tough break.\'94 In this logic, the border is not a line of law but a stage for deterrence, and individual rights are expendable.\
\
The same tools were turned against people whose only offense was dissent. Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and permanent resident who had just graduated from Columbia, was arrested and held in Louisiana, accused of supporting terrorism because of his campus organizing. A far\uc0\u8209 right group boasted of feeding his name, and thousands of others, to the government. Later in the week, the administration used an obscure provision that allows deportation of foreign nationals whose presence is deemed adverse to U.S. foreign policy to justify his arrest, tying campus protest to diplomatic interests. At Georgetown, Badar Khan Suri, an Indian academic, was detained after his visa was revoked over alleged Hamas ties; a judge barred his deportation, finding that the case appeared to rest on his political views. A Cornell PhD student who sued to block executive orders targeting foreign protesters was told by DHS to surrender to immigration authorities. Together, these cases showed how immigration law can be repurposed to police speech, especially when that speech challenges U.S. policy in the Middle East.\
\
Citizenship itself grew more stratified. ICE intensified raids on Chinese immigrants, including in sanctuary cities, aided by Beijing\'92s willingness to accept deportees. A German green\uc0\u8209 card holder returning home through Boston was stripped, placed in a cold shower, and pressured to give up his status. A Canadian woman with a valid work visa spent two weeks in detention, shuffled between facilities without clear explanation. At the end of the week, the Department of Homeland Security revoked temporary legal status for more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who had been allowed to live and work in the United States under a Biden\u8209 era parole program. With a stroke of a pen, hundreds of thousands of people moved from lawful presence to potential deportability. The message was plain. For certain nationalities and political profiles, legal protections are contingent and can be withdrawn en masse.\
\
While the border and the courts absorbed the most visible shocks, the administrative state was being quietly re\uc0\u8209 engineered. The Department of Government Efficiency\'97DOGE\'97continued to act as the spear point. Its teams arrived at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, sent staff home, swore in a new acting director, and canceled contracts and grants, in line with an executive order calling for the agency\'92s elimination. DOGE workers forced their way into the U.S. Institute of Peace building, despite the institute\'92s claim to be an independent nonprofit created by Congress. Another order granted DOGE broad access to unclassified records, data, and software systems across federal agencies, under the banner of eliminating \'93information silos.\'94 In parallel, the Social Security Administration, under pressure from internal memos and DOGE\'92s fraud\u8209 hunting mandate, froze a program that automatically issues Social Security numbers to newly authorized workers and naturalized citizens, and imposed new identity\u8209 verification rules that will push tens of thousands of elderly and disabled claimants into already overburdened field offices each week.\
\
Federal judges pushed back against some of these incursions. A district court in Maryland blocked DOGE from accessing Social Security systems, called its efforts a fishing expedition, and ordered the destruction of any personal data already collected. Another judge ruled that the shutdown of USAID likely violated the Constitution because it deprived Congress of its authority over agencies it had created and funded, and ordered parts of the aid agency restored. A separate court temporarily blocked the administration from clawing back $20 billion in EPA climate grants. These rulings showed that the judiciary still had tools to defend the basic architecture of the administrative state. They also revealed the limits of those tools when the executive is willing to move first and litigate later. By the time a judge orders restoration, staff have been sent home, systems have been disrupted, and the signal has been sent that no agency is safe from restructuring by decree.\
\
Education became the second major front. On March 20 and 21, Trump signed a series of executive orders directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department of Education. The orders criticized federal control over schools, instructed the secretary to close the department and return authority to states and localities, and set in motion the transfer of student loan servicing to the Small Business Administration and disability\uc0\u8209 related education services to Health and Human Services. In parallel, the administration had already removed online applications for income\u8209 driven repayment plans from the department\'92s website, and the American Federation of Teachers sued, arguing that millions of borrowers were being unlawfully denied access to statutory repayment options. Teachers\'92 unions, state attorneys general, and Democratic lawmakers warned that the department\'92s civil\u8209 rights enforcement and funding for low\u8209 income students were at risk. Yet the orders went forward, using executive power to unbuild a cabinet department that Congress had created.\
\
Universities themselves were brought under direct pressure. Columbia University lost $400 million in federal contracts and grants, with the administration demanding a mask ban, the winding down of certain academic departments, and expanded campus policing as conditions for restoring funds. The University of Pennsylvania saw $175 million in federal funding frozen over its policies allowing transgender women to compete in women\'92s sports. A new taskforce was announced to investigate alleged antisemitism at ten major universities, and letters went out to sixty schools warning of investigations into discrimination against Jewish students. At the same time, the Department of Education halted processing of income\uc0\u8209 driven repayment plans, prompting lawsuits from the AFT. The combined effect was to turn federal funding and oversight into levers for reshaping campus culture, admissions, and protest, with the threat of financial ruin hanging over institutions that did not comply.\
\
The campaign against knowledge institutions extended beyond campuses. The administration eliminated the U.S. Agency for Global Media, effectively shutting down Voice of America and related broadcasters, and placed more than a thousand journalists on administrative leave. Contracts with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia were terminated; RFE/RL sued, arguing that the cuts violated the Constitution and federal law. The White House restricted Associated Press access to the Oval Office and Air Force One after the AP refused to adopt the term \'93Gulf of America,\'94 and a federal judge declined to restore that access on an emergency basis. At the Pentagon and in the armed forces, diversity and inclusion programs were dismantled. Web pages honoring Navajo code talkers, Black Medal of Honor recipients, and women pilots were removed or relabeled as \'93DEI,\'94 only to be partially restored after public outcry. The Air Force dropped training modules on the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots. These moves did not erase history in a single stroke, but they began to curate which stories of the nation\'92s past would remain visible.\
\
At the same time, the administration was not shy about releasing records that suited its narrative. Thousands of pages of JFK assassination files were made public under a \'93maximum transparency\'94 initiative, overseen by the Director of National Intelligence. The release expanded access to Cold War\uc0\u8209 era documents without, by most expert accounts, changing the core story. It stood in contrast to the quiet removal of disability guidance from the Justice Department\'92s website, including information on COVID\u8209 19, masking, and accessibility, and to the deletion of the Surgeon General\'92s advisory framing gun violence as a public health issue. In one domain, transparency was used to burnish the image of openness. In others, the removal of guidance narrowed the informational ground on which advocates and citizens could stand.\
\
The week also deepened the entanglement between billionaire allies and the machinery of the state. Elon Musk\'92s Starlink service was installed across the White House campus as a \'93donation,\'94 raising procurement and security concerns. A Musk employee who also worked for DOGE handled the installation, triggering a Secret Service alert when the timing was not properly coordinated. The Federal Aviation Administration canceled a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and instead paid Starlink to manage U.S. airspace communications, prompting Democratic senators to call for corruption investigations. Reports surfaced that the Pentagon had scheduled a briefing for Musk on U.S. war plans for a potential conflict with China; after the story broke, officials walked back the plan, and Trump later acknowledged that Musk\'92s business ties to China made such briefings inappropriate. Yet on March 21, Musk still received a private briefing at the Pentagon, underscoring his dual role as contractor and informal strategist.\
\
Other appointments reinforced the same pattern. Trump named Michael Flynn, who had publicly mused about martial law, to the board overseeing West Point, and appointed other loyalists, including Charlie Kirk, to military academy boards. He fired both Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, leaving the agency without a quorum and likely in violation of statutes that protect commissioners from removal without cause. Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, lobbied for a $25 billion plan to privatize the deportation of twelve million migrants, pitching a contractor\uc0\u8209 run apparatus for mass removals. A federal judge later ruled that Musk\'92s role in dismantling USAID likely violated the Constitution, and another blocked DOGE from accessing Social Security data. But the direction of travel was clear. Core state functions\'97from border enforcement to communications, from regulation to war planning\'97were being opened to a narrow circle of private actors whose fortunes were tied to the regime.\
\
Abroad, U.S. commitments to allies and to global accountability eroded further. The Pentagon, under Secretary Pete Hegseth, froze intelligence and weapons packages to Ukraine, and the administration withdrew from an international body tasked with investigating responsibility for the invasion. A contract with a university team that had been transferring evidence of Russian abductions of Ukrainian children to European law enforcement was terminated, disrupting efforts to document war crimes. Trump held calls with Vladimir Putin about a ceasefire, with Russian accounts emphasizing demands to end U.S. military aid. At the same time, the administration ordered airstrikes in Yemen without congressional authorization, killing civilians in Sana\'92a and elsewhere, and announced that \'93overwhelming lethal force\'94 would continue until Houthi attacks on shipping stopped. Plans emerged for a militarized buffer zone along the New Mexico border, staffed by active\uc0\u8209 duty troops with authority to detain migrants, raising questions about the Posse Comitatus Act. These moves shifted foreign and military policy away from institutional channels and toward leader\u8209 to\u8209 leader deals and unilateral force.\
\
Within Congress, formal processes continued but with diminished leverage. A Republican\uc0\u8209 led stopgap funding bill passed the Senate with the support of ten Democrats, after House Democrats had largely opposed it. The bill funded the government through September, increased defense spending, and cut nondefense and IRS funding. Schumer argued that a shutdown would hand Trump and Musk even more control over spending; progressives countered that passing the bill surrendered the only real leverage to slow the restructuring of the state. Representative Glenn Ivey called for Schumer\'92s removal as minority leader. The Full\u8209 Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act became law, ensuring that agencies would remain open even as their missions were being rewritten by executive order. The Federal Election Commission, for its part, scheduled closed and open Sunshine Act meetings and an audit hearing, a reminder that some oversight routines still functioned in the background.\
\
Civil society did not stand still. Democratic attorneys general held community impact hearings across the country, gathering testimony from veterans, immigrants, and others harmed by federal policies, and used that record to support roughly ten lawsuits against the administration. They secured temporary restraining orders in nearly all of them, then filed motions to enforce when agencies failed to comply. Environmental groups faced a chilling verdict in North Dakota, where a jury ordered Greenpeace entities to pay more than $660 million to a pipeline company over their role in Dakota Access protests, a decision likely to embolden similar suits against activists. At the same time, Representative Jasmine Crockett helped organize nationwide nonviolent protests at Tesla dealerships, urging people to sell their cars and stock in response to Musk\'92s role in government cuts. A women\'92s justice group launched a campaign to extradite Andrew Tate, seeking to use international law to address alleged abuses. These efforts showed that organized resistance still had tools, but they also faced a legal and rhetorical environment that increasingly cast dissent as disorder or even terrorism.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 9, several fault lines were already in motion. Courts had set deadlines for the administration to explain its defiance of deportation orders and its use of DOGE to access Social Security data. Lawsuits over the dismantling of the Department of Education, the freezing of student loan repayment options, and the shutdown of USAID and cultural agencies were underway. The FEC had scheduled meetings and an audit hearing that would test whether campaign oversight could proceed in a charged climate. State legislatures were advancing bills to reclassify mifepristone as a controlled substance, and federal health officials were preparing reviews that could tighten access to abortion medication. Universities were weighing how to respond to funding freezes and taskforce investigations without abandoning academic freedom. None of these processes guaranteed a particular outcome, but they marked the next set of arenas where the balance between law and power would be contested.\
\
By the end of Week 9, the Democracy Clock\'92s move to 7:56 p.m. captured a shift that was less about any single order or lawsuit than about the pattern they formed together. Executive power was being exercised as if oversight were optional. Law was being stretched, repurposed, or ignored to punish enemies and protect allies. Citizenship and legal protection were being sorted by nationality, ideology, and identity, with migrants, students, and dissenters pushed to the edge of the legal order. Agencies that once served as neutral machinery of government were being hollowed out, politicized, or handed to private contractors. Institutions that produce knowledge and memory\'97universities, broadcasters, archives, museums\'97were being pressured to align with the regime\'92s narratives or lose funding and visibility. Courts, state officials, and civil society still mounted real resistance, and in some cases they won. But the week showed that when a presidency is willing to defy rulings, threaten judges, and treat constitutional limits as negotiable, those victories are fragile. The official time at the close of the period, 7:56 p.m., marks a democracy that still functions in form, but in which the habits that keep power bounded are wearing thin.\
