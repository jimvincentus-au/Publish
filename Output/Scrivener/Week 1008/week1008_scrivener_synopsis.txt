This chapter steps back from weekly events to define the Democracy Clock itself: a diagnostic instrument for tracking the condition of a republic. It introduces sixty authoritarian traits, grouped across power, institutions, law, economics, and civil society, each scored for presence and difficulty of reversal. Their cumulative weight translates into minutes between noon, a fully functioning modern democracy, and midnight, the stable end of self-government. The chapter describes how promises, imperatives, deliverables, and the civic covenant are inverted as the clock advances, and how clusters of traits entrench damage. It also insists that time can move in both directions: authoritarian habits can be dismantled, and repair can be measured as rigorously as decline. By fixing clear poles and a shared scale, the Democracy Clock becomes a guard against denial, nostalgia, and wishful thinking about the state of American democracy.
