<h1>Week 1 Appendix: Emergencies as Operating System</h1>
<p><em>In Trump’s first week back in office, overlapping emergencies, purges, and decrees turn the presidency into a central engine of unilateral rule.</em></p>
<p>This week represents an extraordinary shock to American democratic structure, driven by a dense cluster of Trump executive orders, personnel purges, and symbolic moves that together approximate a constitutional hard‑break. The most intense pressures fall on executive constraint, equal citizenship, rule of law, and the nonpartisan civil service. Trump declares overlapping national emergencies, militarizes the border, and openly defies statute and Supreme Court rulings (TikTok delay), while re‑imposing Schedule F and firing inspectors general and senior career officials, effectively subordinating the bureaucracy to personal loyalty. Simultaneously, he attempts to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment by decree, stratifying citizenship by parentage, and launches a sweeping anti‑immigrant regime: CBP One is shut down, asylum and refugee programs suspended, expedited removals expanded, and sanctuary jurisdictions threatened with prosecution. Mass pardons for January 6 and FACE Act offenders, plus a pause on Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement, signal that violence and corruption in service of the regime will be protected. Parallel moves dismantle DEI, revoke long‑standing anti‑discrimination orders, and weaponize abortion and gender policy, while fossil‑fuel and crypto orders entrench crony capitalism. Courts, states, civil society, and some Republicans do push back—blocking birthright changes, suing DOGE and Schedule F, and organizing opposition—but they are reacting to a coordinated, high‑velocity consolidation of presidential power.</p>
