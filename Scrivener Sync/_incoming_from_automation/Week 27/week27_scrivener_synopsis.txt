Week 27 is defined less by motion than by consolidation. The Democracy Clock stays fixed at 11:09 p.m., but the apparent stillness masks a deepening standoff. The executive expands its reach over immigration enforcement, homelessness policy, artificial intelligence, and crypto‑driven finance, while wielding civil courts and the Department of Justice against media and political rivals. Congress’s leadership helps shield Jeffrey Epstein records, even as a bipartisan House subcommittee forces subpoenas and federal judges insist on grand jury rules and due process. Immigration budgets, detention infrastructure, and sweeping homelessness orders retool the state toward removal and control, not care. Simultaneously, the administration engineers the information environment through press‑pool retaliation, AI‑generated propaganda, and ideologically conditioned media mergers. Yet courts restore TPS for some immigrants, block the birthright‑citizenship order, pause anti‑DEI laws, and revive transparency tools. Civil society protests, local legal challenges, and data‑driven critiques of tariffs and crime narratives show resistance that is real but outgunned. The hour does not advance, but the trench lines deepen.
