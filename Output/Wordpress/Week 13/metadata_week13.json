Behind them, a small analog clock reads 7:57, and a dim desk lamp casts sharp shadows. A muted television screen in the background shows a blurred news anchor with the sound off, suggesting controlled information and stratified citizenship in a realistic, painterly style.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of a grand neoclassical courthouse and university campus facing a city skyline, with a large clock reading 7:57 p.m. looming in the sky. In the foreground, a fenced-off plaza shows scattered protest signs and a few isolated figures watched by uniformed officers. Some windows in the courthouse glow warmly while others are dark, and digital billboards nearby display blurred, censored headlines. The atmosphere is tense and painterly, with subtle hints of surveillance cameras and distant barbed wire, evoking democratic institutions under quiet, methodical pressure."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 13 of Trump\u2019s second term was defined less by a single rupture than by the coordinated use of law, bureaucracy, and information to tilt the landscape toward obedience. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:56 to 7:57 p.m., a 0.2\u2011minute shift that masked deepening structural erosion. The administration openly tested judicial authority in the Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda saga, defying a unanimous Supreme Court order while classifying its El Salvador prison deal and seeking to block contempt. Immigration and citizenship tools were wielded against students, activists, transgender people, and even citizens, as mass visa revocations, social\u2011media vetting, and proof\u2011of\u2011citizenship voting rules advanced. Civil rights enforcement was inverted: disparate\u2011impact liability gutted, the DOJ Civil Rights Division repurposed, and federal funds used to coerce states and schools. Universities and media faced funding freezes, tax and licensing threats, and book bans, while transparency sites and Covid.gov were rewritten or removed. Tariff whiplash, deregulation, and civil service politicization entrenched crony capitalism. Courts, states, universities, and civil society pushed back, but mostly after the fact, as the distance between formal rights and lived security widened.",
