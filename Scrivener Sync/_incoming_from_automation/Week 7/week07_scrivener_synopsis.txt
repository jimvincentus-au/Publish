Week 7 of Trump’s second term marks a sharp consolidation of power rather than a single spectacular break. The Democracy Clock jumps from 9:12 p.m. to 9:32 p.m. as civil service protections, regulatory agencies, and financial rules are systematically repurposed. DOGE‑driven mass firings at Social Security, Veterans Affairs, the IRS, State, and Education hollow out neutral capacity and invite partisan and private replacements. Law is openly bent toward friends and against enemies: a disfavored law firm is targeted by executive order, prosecutions of well‑connected crypto figures stall, and AI‑driven visa revocations punish ideology. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile blur public policy with insider portfolios, while tariffs and trade whiplash offload risk onto the public. Universities, immigrants, and protesters face financial and legal pressure to conform. Courts and civil society still resist in places—blocking some firings, funding freezes, and anti‑labor moves—but the week’s net effect is to thicken the walls around power and narrow the channels of accountability.
