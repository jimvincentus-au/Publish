Week 18 is defined less by a single rupture than by accumulated strain. The Democracy Clock holds at 10:40 p.m., not because the week was quiet, but because structural damage and structural resistance roughly cancel out. House Republicans muscle through the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” locking in tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy while slashing Medicaid, SNAP, and enforcement against elite tax evasion. Immigration power is weaponized through mass deportation plans, TPS termination for Venezuelans, and aggressive ICE tactics that leave refugees stateless and chill oversight. The executive moves to politicize civil service, dismantle oversight, and accept foreign jets and crypto patronage, while the Supreme Court edges toward a stronger unitary executive. Yet federal judges block some deportations, protect international students, and halt the dismantling of key institutions. Technical work at agencies like EPA and FDA continues. The result is a republic running hot: battered guardrails still holding, but under visible, intensifying pressure.
