Resistance from courts, legislatures, and civil society remained real but largely reactive, slowing rather than reversing the erosion.",

A small desk clock fixed at 8:06 p.m. sits atop a stack of immigration case files and a torn public broadcasting logo. In the background, a faint reflection of barbed wire and data code on frosted glass. Low, moody lighting, no recognizable faces.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit federal cityscape in painterly realism: a large clock face frozen at 8:06 p.m. looms over government buildings. In the foreground, armored agents in indistinct uniforms conduct a raid on a warehouse while computer servers glow behind glass, cables feeding into a distant IRS-style office. On one side, a shuttered public broadcasting studio and a darkened courthouse; on the other, stacks of redacted files and shredded documents blowing across a plaza. The mood is tense and subdued, with long shadows and muted colors."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 26 of Trump\u2019s second term registered no movement on the Democracy Clock, holding at 8:06 p.m., yet the apparent stillness masked a dense consolidation of power. Immigration enforcement hardened into a standing emergency: militarized raids at cannabis farms left workers injured and one dead, bond hearings were stripped from judges, rapid deportations expanded, and confidential tax and health data were repurposed for targeting. Masked agents staged mass removals from sites like Terminal Island, while courts offered only partial friction. Inside the state, an executive order creating Schedule G, mass layoffs at State and Education, politicized appointments at DOJ, NIH, and VA, and FEMA centralization pushed the civil service toward loyalty over competence. Simultaneously, the Epstein files saga showcased secrecy as method: DOJ opacity, missing video, retaliatory firings, and blocked amendments gave way to tactical unsealing under pressure. Cuts to public media, climate and economic data, housing enforcement, and foreign aid hollowed public goods as tariffs, surveillance contracts, and Trump\u2019s revived foreign business deals enriched aligned actors. Resistance\u2014from courts, states, and civil society\u2014surfaced as friction, not reversal.",
