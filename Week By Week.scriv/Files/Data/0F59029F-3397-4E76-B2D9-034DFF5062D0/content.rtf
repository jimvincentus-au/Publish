\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 43 Appendix: Welfare and Memory as Weapons\
\
This week shows an executive increasingly unconstrained by effective oversight, using clemency, emergency leverage, and security powers to protect allies and punish opponents while courts and civil society mount only partial resistance. The most intense pressure falls on rule-of-law traits: law as weapon, elite impunity, politicized justice, and federal power weaponized against disfavored regions and populations. Mass pardons for 2020 election subversion and January 6 figures, efforts to dismantle the CFPB, and targeted investigations of critics (Comey, Letitia James, Swalwell) exemplify systemic capture of legal institutions. Simultaneously, immigration and domestic security tools are deployed aggressively\'97Operation Midway Blitz, DACA targeting, mass deportation plans\'97while judges in Chicago, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, and Georgia intermittently reassert constraints. Economic and social policy is used as hardball leverage: SNAP and HUD cuts, shutdown brinkmanship, and housing/healthcare proposals that deepen inequality. Information control and memory politics intensify through attacks on the BBC, withheld economic data, AI-driven campaign disinformation, and maneuvers around the Epstein files. Yet Congress\'92s discharge petition on Epstein, state-level voting and redistricting rulings, and some corporate and judicial pushback show countervailing, though weaker, democratic repair forces.\

Week 43 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump proposed abolishing private health insurance in favor of small direct government payouts (2025-11-08): Trump\'92s proposal to replace insurance with limited cash payouts would centralize federal control over healthcare coverage while exposing people with serious illnesses to large uncovered costs, shifting power over basic welfare away from regulated insurance markets.\
\
2. President Trump pressed Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to pass shutdown legislation (2025-11-08): Trump\'92s push to end the filibuster sought to remove a key minority check in the Senate, making it easier for a single party to legislate unilaterally during high\uc0\u8209 stakes budget conflicts.\
\
3. President Trump refused to fund SNAP benefits and used them as leverage in shutdown negotiations (2025-11-10): By withholding food assistance for 42 million people to force acceptance of his preferred continuing resolution, Trump used executive control over welfare programs as a bargaining weapon in partisan budget disputes.\
\
4. U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered states to reverse full November SNAP payments and threatened financial penalties (2025-11-09): USDA\'92s directive to claw back lawfully issued food aid and punish noncompliant states used federal administrative power to override state efforts to protect low\uc0\u8209 income residents during the shutdown.\
\
5. President Trump ordered air traffic controllers back to work during the shutdown under threat of pay cuts (2025-11-10): Compelling unpaid air traffic controllers to work under threat of financial punishment leveraged executive authority over critical workers to manage a crisis created by the shutdown, weakening labor bargaining power in essential services.\
\
6. President Trump terminated the CBP One asylum scheduling app (2025-11-12): Ending CBP One sharply reduced legal avenues for asylum seekers to enter and apply at ports of entry, concentrating discretionary power in border enforcement and increasing migrants\'92 exposure to irregular, less accountable processes.\
\
7. President Trump signed legislation to reopen the federal government after a record shutdown (2025-11-12): Trump\'92s signature ended the 43\uc0\u8209 day shutdown and restored federal operations, underscoring how presidential assent ultimately controls the resumption of core government functions after partisan brinkmanship.\
\
8. President Trump issued broad pardons to dozens of 2020 election subversion allies (2025-11-09): By pardoning 77 figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Trump used clemency to shield political allies from federal accountability for attacks on electoral integrity.\
\
9. President Trump issued a sweeping pardon for all U.S. citizens\'92 conduct related to the 2020 election (2025-11-11): The blanket 2020\uc0\u8209 related pardon attempted to erase federal liability for a wide range of election\u8209 related misconduct, weakening deterrence against future attempts to subvert democratic outcomes.\
\
10. President Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao after his money\uc0\u8209 laundering conviction (2025-11-10): Pardoning a high\u8209 profile financial criminal on claims of a prior administration \'93witch\u8209 hunt\'94 signaled willingness to override judicial outcomes for well\u8209 connected economic actors, blurring lines between justice and political loyalty.\
\
11. President Trump pardoned Robert Harshbarger Jr., husband of a sitting member of Congress (2025-11-10): Granting a quiet pardon to a lawmaker\'92s spouse convicted of healthcare fraud raised concerns that clemency was being used as a political favor rather than a neutral tool of mercy.\
\
12. President Trump pardoned British billionaire Joe Lewis for insider trading (2025-11-13): Trump\'92s pardon of Joe Lewis, a wealthy foreign financier convicted of insider trading, reinforced perceptions that elite economic offenders can secure relief from punishment through political access.\
\
13. President Trump pardoned militia member Dan Wilson for a felony gun conviction tied to January 6 (2025-11-14): Pardoning a January 6\uc0\u8209 linked militia member for weapons offenses signaled leniency toward those who used force around an attack on Congress, weakening accountability for violence against democratic institutions.\
\
14. President Trump kept national parks open during the shutdown despite mass furloughs (2025-11-14): Maintaining open parks without adequate staffing prioritized optics over safety and stewardship, using executive discretion in ways that strained public resources and risked damage to shared natural assets.\
\
15. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate Jeffrey Epstein\'92s ties to prominent Democrats (2025-11-14): Directing DOJ to focus a new Epstein probe on Democratic figures risked turning federal investigative power into a partisan tool and could justify withholding records from transparency mandates.\
\
16. White House officials withheld release of October jobs and inflation reports while offering anecdotal claims about prices (2025-11-14): Blocking standard economic data releases and substituting selective anecdotes undermined routine transparency about economic conditions, limiting the public\'92s ability to evaluate government performance.\
\
17. President Trump issued an executive order on foster care titled \'93Fostering the Future for American Children and Families\'94 (2025-11-13): The foster\uc0\u8209 care order directed HHS to modernize data systems and expand partnerships, including with faith\u8209 based groups, reshaping how a vulnerable population is served through executive policy rather than legislation.\
\
18. President Trump signed an unspecified executive order in Washington, DC (2025-11-13): Trump\'92s additional executive order, reported without details, illustrated the ongoing use of unilateral directives to shape policy outside normal legislative debate.\
\
19. President Trump issued an executive order modifying reciprocal tariffs on certain agricultural products (2025-11-14): Adjusting agricultural tariffs by executive order allowed the president to recalibrate trade burdens and benefits for specific sectors without new congressional action, concentrating trade policy discretion in the executive.\
\
20. President Trump planned to tighten USCIS rules for applicants from travel\uc0\u8209 ban countries (2025-11-14): The planned policy to treat \'93country\u8209 specific factors\'94 from banned nations as negatives in visa and green\u8209 card decisions would embed executive\u8209 driven nationality\u8209 based discrimination into immigration adjudications.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Bipartisan public health advocates and Senator Roger Marshall removed language from a federal food bill that would have preempted state toxic\uc0\u8209 ingredient labeling laws (2025-11-08): Advocacy forced removal of a preemption clause from the Better Food Disclosure Act, preserving states\'92 authority to require truthful labeling of toxic ingredients and demonstrating effective external pressure on federal lawmaking.\
\
2. Senate Republicans floated replacing Obamacare with health savings accounts (2025-11-08): The GOP proposal to shift from comprehensive coverage to health savings accounts would move healthcare risk onto individuals, especially lower\uc0\u8209 income people, through legislative redesign of the safety net.\
\
3. Senate Democrats offered a shutdown compromise to extend ACA premium tax credits for one year (2025-11-08): Democrats\'92 proposal to trade a short\uc0\u8209 term funding bill for a one\u8209 year extension of ACA subsidies used legislative bargaining to protect healthcare affordability during the shutdown.\
\
4. Senate Republicans rejected Democrats\'92 shutdown compromise as a \'93nonstarter\'94 (2025-11-08): Republicans\'92 refusal to consider a compromise that paired government funding with ACA subsidy extensions prolonged the shutdown and highlighted partisan gridlock over core social policy.\
\
5. U.S. Senate advanced and approved a compromise funding package to end the 40\uc0\u8209 plus\u8209 day shutdown (2025-11-10): Senate votes to advance and pass a stopgap funding bill restored federal operations, reversed mass firings, and guaranteed back pay, but left ACA tax credits unresolved, reflecting partial institutional repair under constrained terms.\
\
6. House of Representatives returned from a prolonged recess and began voting on a bill to end the shutdown (2025-11-12): After a 50\uc0\u8209 plus\u8209 day hiatus, the House resumed work to consider a Senate\u8209 brokered funding bill, underscoring how leadership decisions about recess and agenda control can delay resolution of national crises.\
\
7. House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution funding government through January 30, 2026 (2025-11-13): The House\'92s narrow approval of a short\uc0\u8209 term funding bill ended the 43\u8209 day shutdown, restored federal jobs and pay, and extended SNAP funding, but omitted long\u8209 term ACA subsidy relief, reflecting tradeoffs in crisis budgeting.\
\
8. Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised a December vote on extending ACA premium tax credits (2025-11-11): Thune\'92s pledge to schedule a later vote on ACA tax credits was used to secure Democratic support for the shutdown deal, illustrating how leadership controls timing of key social\uc0\u8209 policy decisions.\
\
9. House Democrats filed a discharge petition to force a vote on extending healthcare premium tax credits (2025-11-13): By using a discharge petition to bypass leadership and demand a vote on ACA tax credits, House Democrats relied on rarely used procedural tools to protect access to affordable coverage.\
\
10. House Democrats and a bipartisan group of members used a discharge petition to compel a vote on releasing DOJ\'92s Jeffrey Epstein files (2025-11-13): Securing 218 signatures on a discharge petition forced House consideration of a bill to release Epstein\uc0\u8209 related records, challenging leadership\'92s control over transparency\u8209 related oversight.\
\
11. House Oversight Committee Democrats released selected Epstein emails referencing Donald Trump (2025-11-12): Oversight Democrats\'92 publication of Epstein emails suggesting Trump\'92s awareness of abuse used congressional investigative powers to inform public debate and build support for broader document disclosure.\
\
12. President Trump and House and Senate leadership enacted the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026 (2025-11-12): Passage of the multi\uc0\u8209 sector appropriations law restored funding for key federal functions, demonstrating that, despite deep conflict, the formal budget process can still be completed through negotiated compromise.\
\
13. Senate Democrats negotiated behind closed doors on a deal to end the shutdown (2025-11-10): Ongoing, opaque Senate talks over shutdown terms highlighted how critical fiscal decisions often occur in leadership\uc0\u8209 driven negotiations with limited public visibility or rank\u8209 and\u8209 file input.\
\
14. House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed but ultimately administered the oath to Representative\uc0\u8209 elect Adelita Grijalva (2025-11-12): After a 49\u8209 day delay, swearing in Adelita Grijalva restored full representation for her district and enabled her to sign key discharge petitions, underscoring how leadership can slow but not fully block membership changes.\
\
15. Ed Martin as pardon attorney opened an investigation into Biden\uc0\u8209 era pardons and commutations (2025-11-11): The new pardon attorney\'92s probe of a prior administration\'92s clemency decisions marked an unusual politicization of an office traditionally focused on evaluating petitions, potentially chilling future independent use of clemency.\
\
16. President Trump and the Department of Justice moved in court to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\'92s funding structure (2025-11-11): Arguing that CFPB cannot draw funds from the Federal Reserve and will soon run dry, the administration sought to neutralize a key consumer watchdog through litigation rather than legislation.\
\
17. President Trump and FHFA Director Bill Pulte politicized the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Fannie Mae oversight (2025-11-11): Pulte\'92s attacks on political opponents, calls to fire the Fed chair, and removal of Fannie Mae ethics officials investigating a Trump ally showed regulatory institutions being steered toward partisan and personal agendas.\
\
18. President Trump appointed Ed Martin, a MAGA loyalist, as Justice Department pardon attorney (2025-11-11): Installing a partisan activist who promoted 2020 election falsehoods to oversee clemency decisions undermined expectations that this gatekeeping role would be neutral and merit\uc0\u8209 based.\
\
19. U.S. Justice Department joined a Republican lawsuit challenging California\'92s new congressional map (2025-11-14): DOJ\'92s decision to side with California Republicans against a map favoring Democrats injected federal executive power into a partisan redistricting fight, raising questions about neutral enforcement of voting\uc0\u8209 rights principles.\

\
22. U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to state laws counting mail ballots received after Election Day (2025-11-10): By taking up cases on late\uc0\u8209 arriving mail ballots, the Court positioned itself to redefine how flexibly states can administer mail voting, with potential nationwide effects on ballot access.\

\
29. U.S. Justice Department joined California Republicans\'92 lawsuit against the state\'92s congressional map (2025-11-14): By backing claims that California\'92s map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander favoring Democrats, DOJ took a side in partisan redistricting litigation, complicating perceptions of its neutrality.\
\
30. House Oversight Committee Republicans released 20,000 pages of Epstein documents about reputation\uc0\u8209 management efforts (2025-11-14): Publishing internal Epstein communications on suppressing negative coverage expanded the public record on elite abuse and image control, though it also intersected with partisan battles over related investigations.\
\
31. Former Judge Mark L. Wolf resigned from the bench to speak publicly about threats to democracy and rule of law (2025-11-10): Wolf\'92s resignation to advocate against perceived abuses by the Trump administration highlighted the strain on judicial norms and the difficulty of addressing systemic threats from within the courts.\

\
33. President Eisenhower issued a 1954 proclamation redefining Armistice Day as Veterans Day (2025-11-12): Eisenhower\'92s proclamation reframing November 11 as Veterans Day linked executive symbolism to honoring service and promoting peace, shaping national rituals around war and democracy.\
\
\
Economic Structure\
\
1. U.S. Department of Agriculture and Trump administration withheld and attempted to claw back November SNAP benefits during the shutdown (2025-11-10): Refusing to use emergency reserves and directing states to undo full SNAP payments turned basic food assistance into a bargaining chip, heightening food insecurity for millions to gain leverage in budget talks.\
\
2. U.S. Supreme Court issued an administrative stay allowing continued withholding of $4 billion in SNAP funds (2025-11-12): The Court\'92s stay let the administration pause a lower\uc0\u8209 court order to distribute full SNAP benefits, prolonging uncertainty for 42 million recipients and reinforcing executive leverage over anti\u8209 hunger programs.\
\
3. Federal courts ordered the administration to fund SNAP and repeatedly blocked directives to undo payments (2025-11-10): District and appellate rulings requiring emergency SNAP funding and rejecting efforts to claw back benefits underscored judicial willingness to enforce statutory welfare obligations during political standoffs.\
\
4. U.S. Congress and President Trump cut more than half of HUD\'92s Continuum of Care homelessness funding (2025-11-13): Policy changes slashing federal homelessness grants threatened services for up to 170,000 people, signaling a shift away from federal responsibility for housing precarity.\
\
5. Trump administration declared CFPB unable to seek further Fed funding, risking its closure (2025-11-10): By asserting that CFPB is barred from drawing additional Federal Reserve funds, the administration set up a funding cliff that could effectively shutter the consumer watchdog without repealing its mandate.\
\
6. Bill Pulte and President Trump proposed a 50\uc0\u8209 year mortgage as a solution to the housing crisis (2025-11-11): The 50\u8209 year mortgage plan would lower monthly payments but increase lifetime interest costs, shifting long\u8209 term gains to lenders while deepening household indebtedness.\
\
7. Bill Pulte as FHFA Director fired Fannie Mae employees and dismantled DEI and internal watchdog functions (2025-11-11): Removing staff under the guise of ending DEI while sidelining investigators probing a Trump ally weakened internal oversight at a major mortgage guarantor, increasing risks of politicized misuse of financial data.\
\
8. Trump administration reviewed and threatened to pull federal funding from New York City after Zohran Mamdani\'92s election (2025-11-10): Targeting NYC\'92s federal support in response to a progressive mayoral victory used fiscal tools to pressure a disfavored local government and constrain its policy agenda.\
\
9. Department of Homeland Security invoked a national emergency to award a $220 million ad contract without competitive bidding (2025-11-14): By bypassing procurement rules to benefit a firm tied to Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS used emergency powers in ways that raised conflict\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 interest and cronyism concerns.\

10. Environmental Protection Agency approved Utah\'92s interstate ozone transport plan for the 2008 standard (2025-11-10): EPA\'92s approval of Utah\'92s plan to limit cross\uc0\u8209 border ozone pollution enforced federal air\u8209 quality rules while delegating implementation to the state, balancing national standards with local control.\
\
11. Environmental Protection Agency extended comment and compliance timelines for chemical risk evaluations and protections (2025-11-13): EPA\'92s extensions for D4 and methylene chloride reviews and lab compliance dates aimed to preserve scientific input and avoid disrupting monitoring, but also delayed full implementation of worker and environmental safeguards.\
\
12.

\
13. Environmental Protection Agency extended postponement of certain trichloroethylene regulation provisions amid litigation (2025-11-14): Keeping contested TCE restrictions on hold until court challenges conclude delayed stricter controls on a hazardous chemical, reflecting how litigation can slow regulatory protection.\

14. Beam, Eight Sleep, and Rocket Money sponsored Tucker Carlson\'92s podcast despite extremist content, with Rocket Money later withdrawing (2025-11-10): Corporate ad buys on a show featuring white supremacist Nick Fuentes financially supported a platform accused of mainstreaming extremism, though public pressure pushed at least one sponsor to exit.\
\

U.S. government and airlines faced major flight cuts due to unpaid air traffic controllers during the shutdown (2025-11-10): FAA\'92s reduction of thousands of flights because controllers were unpaid showed how shutdowns disrupt critical economic infrastructure and public safety when labor is treated as expendable.\
\
17. European governments and institutions implemented energy and industrial policies affecting electrification, nuclear power, and fossil exploration (2025-11-13): EU efforts to speed grid permitting, Germany\'92s nuclear ban, and the UK\'92s halt to new offshore exploration reshaped energy markets and industrial competitiveness, influencing democratic governments\'92 fiscal and climate choices.\
\
18. Chinese industrial competitors and German manufacturers intensified competition in high\uc0\u8209 end manufacturing, eroding Germany\'92s industrial base (2025-11-13): Rising Chinese market share in advanced machinery threatened German jobs and tax revenues, constraining resources available for social programs and democratic institutions.\
\
\
Civil Rights and Dissent\
\

\
4. ICE and CBP under Operation Midway Blitz conducted mass raids and detentions in Chicago, prompting judicial restraints and releases (2025-11-12): Chicago raids that swept up about 1,300 people, including U.S. citizens, led courts to limit ICE force, order releases, and bar coercive \'93voluntary\'94 deportations, highlighting systemic overreach in immigration enforcement.\
