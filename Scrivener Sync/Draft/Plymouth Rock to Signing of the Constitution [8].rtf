In the early seventeenth century, the Democracy Clock cannot yet run at Plymouth or Jamestown. A democracy requires a demos, a covenant, and a system to measure; none existed on the Atlantic shore when the first settlements took hold. What arrived instead was a collision of empires, economies, and theologies, each carrying a template for hierarchy. Yet these beginnings matter, because the first century and a half on this continent produced the conditions the clock would later measure: the extraction of labor, the seizure of land, the structuring of power, and the invention of institutions that taught people how they might govern\'97and how they might be governed. The era is pre-clock, but not pre-political. It is the long night before the first faint light of self-rule.\
\
English settlement was not designed with democracy in mind. It was built to extend the reach of a crown and the wealth of a company. Jamestown\'92s \'93governance\'94 consisted of martial rule; Plymouth\'92s compact established order among equals only within a community already divided by class, religion, and dependence. Indigenous nations possessed sophisticated political systems, but colonists did not adopt them; they displaced them. Authority rested on charters issued by a distant monarch, interpreted by local elites, and enforced through land claims that ignored prior sovereignty. Nothing in these arrangements suggested a republic. The pattern was imperial subordination outward and hierarchical control inward.\
\
Yet within these settlements emerged habits that would complicate this design. Colonists insisted on assemblies to levy taxes and manage local affairs, not out of democratic conviction but out of necessity. Distance from London made self-administration unavoidable. Town meetings in New England, county courts in Virginia, and annual elections of selectmen or burgesses created cyclical expectations of consultation. These early institutions were narrow in membership\'97white, male, property-holding\'97but they introduced practices of deliberation and dissent that would eventually be claimed as rights. Representation did not democratize society, but it produced the grammar from which democratic claims could later be formed.\
\
The economy of the colonies hardened authoritarian traits that no assembly could disguise. Bondage became a constitutional order long before the Constitution existed. Indigenous dispossession was not episodic but structural, embedded in treaties made and broken in turn. By the early eighteenth century, chattel slavery was not only legal but essential to colonial prosperity, especially in the plantation South. Laws codified racial hierarchy with ferocity: restrictions on movement, assembly, marriage, literacy, and resistance. These were not the excesses of a young society; they were its foundations. Any future republic would have to reckon with this inheritance, and in 1787 it did not.\
\
Religion provided both justification and friction. The Puritan experiment in New England enforced an exacting conformity; dissenters were fined, exiled, or worse. Yet the diversity of sects across the colonies\'97Congregationalists, Anglicans, Quakers, Baptists\'97made any single establishment fragile. Toleration emerged less from principle than from proximity. Even so, the link between civic order and religious power remained tight. Blasphemy was punishable; heresy was civil disorder. The idea that the state must enforce virtue worked its way into colonial law long before it appeared in national debate. When later generations spoke of liberty of conscience, they spoke as those who had lived under its opposite.\
\
Imperial governance deepened the contradictions. The colonies were British subjects without meaningful representation, and the Crown viewed American institutions as administrative conveniences, not political bodies. Governors dismissed assemblies, vetoed local decisions, dissolved courts, and demanded revenue. Each intervention exposed the imbalance between local practice and imperial authority. Colonists who had grown accustomed to managing their own affairs experienced these acts not as policy but as usurpation. They responded first with petitions and boycotts, then with theories of rights that stretched far beyond grievance. The language of representation\'97once a tool of local self-management\'97became a weapon against empire.\
\
Resistance radicalized politics. The Stamp Act crisis united merchants, printers, farmers, and lawyers in a coordinated rejection of mandatory stamps, prompting assemblies to assert rights once whispered. Committees of correspondence linked towns and colonies, creating the first continent-wide political network. The Boston Massacre framed imperial force as tyranny. The Tea Party framed defiance as collective duty. These events did not create democracy, but they did habituate the public to direct action, shared identity, and the idea that government required consent. The gap between colonial law and revolutionary rhetoric widened until it could no longer hold.\
\
War exposed the limits of the political imagination. The Continental Congress unified the colonies but operated as a compact of states, not a government for a people. Independence was declared before a national constitution existed, and the Articles of Confederation left Congress unable to raise revenue, enforce laws, or regulate trade. States adopted their own constitutions, some with broad protections for rights, others with sharp limits on suffrage. Property remained the gatekeeper of political participation. Slavery remained untouched. Yet the war demanded coordination: financing, diplomacy, supply, and command. Necessity created the argument for a stronger union long before ideology did.\
\
The instability of the 1780s forced the next reckoning. Economic dislocation, interstate tariffs, and popular unrest\'97most famously Shays\'92 Rebellion\'97exposed the weakness of the Articles. Congress could not compel states to act; states could not restrain the impulses of their own legislatures; and creditors demanded order. Calls for reform converged on Philadelphia, not to revise but to replace the Articles entirely. The convention that met in 1787 operated behind closed doors, free from public scrutiny, in a deliberate departure from revolutionary openness. It was here, in the tension between necessity and secrecy, that the architecture of a measurable republic began to take shape.\
\
The Constitution that emerged created a national government capable of acting on individuals, not just states. It established a separation of powers, a system of representation, a mechanism for amendment, and an executive able to enforce the law. It also preserved slavery through apportionment, the fugitive clause, and the delay on abolition of the trade. It silenced women entirely, excluded most men, and accepted Indigenous dispossession as a background fact. This was not a contradiction; it was the design. The new republic was built on a narrow conception of the people, with rights protected for some and denied to many. It was a structure capable of democratization but not yet a democracy.\
\
For the first time in American history, the Democracy Clock can now be set. Using the Era 1 trait scores\'97presence and difficulty measured at the Signing, and normalized to remove traits that did not yet exist\'97the United States enters the historical record at a time far closer to midnight than to noon. The republic\'92s foundations included a legislature and courts, but also slavery and exclusion; a separation of powers, but also unaccountable executive authority; a promise of liberty, but not its practice. The structures of democracy were present, but half-formed and compromised. Repair would be possible, but only through conflict, amendment, and sustained civic effort.\
\
This first measurable moment reveals the paradox the nation carried into every subsequent era: a government designed to secure liberty while denying it, a constitutional order capable of broadening rights while entrenching hierarchy, and a people ready to claim representation while limiting who counted as part of the public. The Signing did not resolve these tensions; it formalized them. The clock begins here because the republic begins here, its promises written, its fractures exposed, its distance from noon undeniable. The century to come would decide whether that structure\'92s narrow birthright would expand into a democratic public\'97or defend itself against one.\
