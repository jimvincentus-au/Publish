\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 15 shows an American presidency governing less by persuasion than by decree. The public Democracy Clock remains at 7:51 p.m., yet its internal measure creeps 0.3 minutes closer to midnight as emergency powers, mass pardons, and structural orders quietly expand executive reach. Immigration becomes the main laboratory: militarized border zones, Alien Enemies Act deportations, and family separations test how far rights can be treated as contingent, even for citizens, before courts intervene. The Justice Department is repurposed\'97civil-rights and voting units gutted, corporate and crypto penalties erased, investigations into donors dropped, and new probes aimed at ActBlue and immigration lawyers. DOGE-driven purges and reclassifications politicize the civil service and independent regulators, while public media, universities, and school curricula face funding threats, defunding, and ideological rewrites. Climate science and regulatory enforcement are stripped back in favor of fossil-fuel interests. Courts, states, universities, and mass protests still resist, but increasingly as rear-guard actions against a coordinated project that fuses governance with loyalty and wealth.\
