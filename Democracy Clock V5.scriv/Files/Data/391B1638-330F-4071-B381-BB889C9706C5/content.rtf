In Week 7 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been emerging since inauguration came into sharper focus. The presidency leaned harder on unilateral tools, the bureaucracy was cut and bent toward loyalty, and the line between public policy and private gain blurred further. At the same time, courts, some state legislatures, and civil society pushed back in visible ways. The result was not a single dramatic break, but a dense layering of smaller moves that together shifted how power is held and used. It was a week in which the machinery of government was both hollowed out and repurposed, even as parts of the legal system tried to hold the line.\
\
At the start of Week 7, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:52 p.m., already well into the evening of democratic risk. By the end of the week, the public time was still 7:52 p.m., but the underlying measure had moved another half minute toward midnight. The face of the clock did not change, yet the gears inside turned. That small shift reflects a balance: on one side, aggressive executive overreach, politicization of the civil service, and deepening crony capitalism; on the other, a series of court rulings and civic mobilizations that slowed, but did not reverse, the drift. Executive power operating without effective oversight ticked upward again, as did traits showing law used as a weapon, financial crimes by elites going unpunished, and citizenship stratified by origin and ideology. The week\'92s movement tells us that the formal shell of democracy still stands, but the substance inside is being steadily reworked.\
\
One of the clearest developments was the remaking of the federal civil service and core agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, drove mass layoffs across the government. The administration initiated large-scale reductions in force at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Education, the IRS, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture. Social Security announced consolidation of regional offices and staff cuts reminiscent of the 1980s, with warnings that eligible people might again fail to receive benefits. Internal memos at Veterans Affairs revealed plans to fire more than 80,000 employees, even as demand for veteran care grows. At Agriculture, nearly 6,000 probationary employees had already been terminated before the Merit Systems Protection Board stepped in to order temporary reinstatement. These moves did more than trim budgets. They weakened the neutral, professional backbone of the state and made remaining staff more dependent on political favor.\
\
The Department of Education became a central target. Linda McMahon, a Trump ally with a business background and little experience in education, was confirmed as secretary with a narrow Senate vote. She was tasked with carrying out the president\'92s long-stated aim to dismantle the department. A leaked draft executive order showed plans to abolish it outright. In the meantime, the department offered buyouts to staff ahead of a looming reduction in force and, under DOGE\'92s influence, canceled $900 million in research funding that tracks student progress. The Institute of Education Sciences and the National Center for Education Statistics saw contracts cut, undermining the federal government\'92s ability to know how students are doing and where inequities lie. A federal court halted some of the mass firings as likely illegal, but the direction of travel was clear. There would be less federal oversight, less data, and more room for ideology and market actors to shape schooling.\
\
Other agencies were hollowed or captured in quieter ways. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was effectively shut down from within. After Russell Vought took over as acting head, nearly all staff were placed on indefinite administrative leave. Internal emails instructed employees to ignore legally mandated supervision and examination work, even as CFPB officials told a federal court that the agency was still performing its duties. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered the bureau\'92s chief operating officer to appear for an evidentiary hearing, underscoring the seriousness of the misrepresentation. At the Inter-American Foundation, the White House fired the president and CEO, dissolved the bipartisan board, and installed a single Trump loyalist, Peter Marocco, as both head and sole board member. Most staff were put on paid leave, local grantees were told their contracts would end, and the agency\'92s website was taken offline. Plans were also drawn up to dissolve the independent board of governors of the U.S. Postal Service and place the USPS under the direct control of the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick. In each case, structures designed to diffuse power and protect professional judgment were replaced with concentrated, loyalist control. That was the point.\
\
Alongside this restructuring came a striking fusion of public policy with private and personal financial interests. The most vivid example was the creation of a federal \'93Crypto Strategic Reserve\'94 and a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Over the week, Trump announced on social media and then formalized by executive order a plan for the U.S. government to build a stockpile of specific cryptocurrencies\'97Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano\'97managed by new offices in Treasury and Commerce. The reserve would include tokens seized in forfeiture proceedings, but the order also directed officials to develop strategies for acquiring more, while claiming budget neutrality. Critics noted that members of Trump\'92s family and inner circle were heavily invested in these assets. David Sacks, named as a crypto czar, had venture investments aligned with the chosen coins. Ripple, the company behind XRP, had poured millions into Trump\'92s inauguration and pro\uc0\u8209 crypto political committees, and its token was among those selected. At the same time, the administration halted enforcement of a Biden\u8209 era anti\u8209 money\u8209 laundering rule on shell companies and effectively disabled CFPB supervision. In parallel, the Justice Department halted the fraud prosecution of Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto magnate who had bought large quantities of Trump\u8209 linked memecoins, boosting their value and Trump\'92s personal fortune. Together, these steps showed how wealth could buy not just access, but favorable law and enforcement for those closest to power.\
\
Trade and economic policy followed a similar pattern of volatility and insider advantage. The administration imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and doubled tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. These moves were justified as responses to drug trafficking and unfair trade, and as tools to \'93protect the soul of our country.\'94 They quickly triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada, China, and planned measures from Mexico. Canadian and Chinese duties hit U.S. farm products and manufactured goods, while a Norwegian fuel company announced it would stop selling fuel to U.S. entities in protest of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. U.S. retailers warned of sharp price increases, and an oil analyst reported that Canadian refiners were already adjusting fuel prices to reflect a 10% tariff, with gas and diesel in the Northeast expected to rise by 20 to 40 cents per gallon. The Atlanta Federal Reserve revised its forecast from growth to a 2.8% annualized contraction, and the S&P 500 and NASDAQ fell sharply. In response to market turmoil and industry pressure, the administration carved out exemptions for carmakers, reduced some duties on auto parts and potash, and then paused tariffs on many USMCA\uc0\u8209 compliant goods until April. The rapid imposition, partial reversal, and re\u8209 threatening of tariffs created a sense of economic whiplash. It also created chances for those with inside knowledge to profit from swings that ordinary workers and consumers simply had to absorb.\
\
While domestic economic policy lurched, foreign policy moved further away from traditional democratic alliances and toward Russia\'92s interests. In cyber and intelligence, the administration downgraded Russia as a threat. A State Department official omitted Russia from a list of cyber adversaries at the United Nations, focusing instead on China and Iran. At home, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency instructed analysts not to track or report on Russian threats to U.S. election systems, despite expert warnings. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt planning and operations against Russia, including offensive digital actions, even as the Pentagon publicly denied such a pause. A separate order paused all U.S. cyber operations against Russia as part of a planned \'93reset\'94 with Moscow. At the same time, the administration moved to restore diplomatic and economic ties with Russia by drawing up lists of sanctions to be lifted, and the Kremlin publicly welcomed the shift as aligning with its vision. In the United Nations, the U.S. delegation voted against a resolution condemning Russia\'92s aggression in Ukraine, placing the United States alongside Russia and a small group of states opposed to the measure.\
\
Ukraine policy itself became a lever. In a contentious Oval Office meeting, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance berated President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressured him to accept a ceasefire favorable to Russia, and pushed for rights to Ukrainian rare\uc0\u8209 earth minerals. Russian state media were present; major Western outlets were not. Afterward, Trump announced that U.S. aid to Ukraine might be halted entirely, and the administration paused over $1 billion in military aid that Congress had already approved. Intelligence sharing that allowed Ukraine to target Russian positions was cut off, and commercial satellite imagery providers were pressed to restrict Ukraine\'92s access. Plans were reported to deport roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who had been granted temporary legal status in the United States after fleeing the war, a move later walked back after public outcry. European leaders responded by rallying in London to reaffirm support for Ukraine, while French President Emmanuel Macron warned that Europe must be prepared to face Russia without U.S. partnership. Allies began to consider withholding intelligence from Washington out of fear that it might be shared with Moscow. In this context, the U.S. also approved a nearly $3 billion emergency arms sale to Israel, including heavy bombs, bypassing Congress, even as Israel imposed a blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza. Emergency authorities, once reserved for rare crises, were becoming routine tools to sidestep legislative oversight in war and peace.\
\
The law itself was increasingly bent toward shielding allies and punishing opponents. The administration\'92s decision to halt Justin Sun\'92s prosecution after his financial support is one example. Another was the Justice Department\'92s review of Tina Peters\'92 conviction for an election\uc0\u8209 system data breach, framed under an executive order on \'93Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\'94 The order invited reinterpretation of lawful prosecutions as political vendettas when they touched figures aligned with Trump\'92s narrative of a stolen 2020 election. At the same time, the president signed an executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, which had represented Democratic interests in the past. The order mandated review and potential suspension of security clearances for firm employees, directed agencies to stop providing goods and services to the firm, and required contractors to disclose any business with it. A separate memo urged agencies to enforce rules requiring upfront fees from those suing the administration, raising the cost of challenging government actions in court. Together, these moves used the tools of law\'97clearances, contracts, filing fees\'97not as neutral safeguards, but as levers to reward friends and deter critics.\
\
Yet the courts did not simply yield. In a series of rulings, federal judges and the Supreme Court checked some of the most aggressive executive actions. Multiple courts, including the high court, rejected the administration\'92s attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already appropriated. Judges ordered the release of some frozen payments to USAID and extended injunctions preventing further impoundment, with one district judge stating plainly that the president lacks authority to override congressional spending decisions. The Supreme Court, in narrow 5\'964 decisions, upheld lower\uc0\u8209 court orders requiring the unfreezing of aid and denied the government\'92s request to block those rulings. In the domestic sphere, a federal court ruled that Trump\'92s abrupt firing of National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox was illegal and ordered her reinstated, emphasizing that the president is not above the law and cannot remove independent board members at will. Another court blocked drastic cuts to medical research funding, preserving ongoing scientific work, while a separate judge halted mass firings of probationary employees at the Department of Education as likely unlawful. The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the temporary reinstatement of thousands of fired USDA employees. And a judge ruled that the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers, could not be removed before his term ended. These decisions did not stop the broader trend, but they showed that the judiciary still had both the will and the capacity to enforce legal limits.\
\
Congress, by contrast, functioned more as a stage than a check. Trump\'92s address to a joint session of Congress became a campaign\uc0\u8209 style rally. He made repeated false claims about Ukraine aid, immigration, and the economy, and framed his policies as a mandate from a grateful nation. The administration curated a guest list that highlighted crimes attributed to undocumented immigrants and controversies around transgender youth, while Senate Democrats invited fired federal workers and Medicaid recipients to underscore the human cost of cuts. During the speech, Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, repeatedly heckled the president and was ordered removed from the chamber by Speaker Mike Johnson. The sergeant\u8209 at\u8209 arms carried out the removal, an unusual step in modern times. Days later, the House voted to censure Green for his conduct, with ten Democrats joining Republicans, and some members sought to strip him of committee assignments. At the same time, the House passed a budget resolution that instructed committees to cut $880 billion in spending to fund tax cuts, mass deportations, and defense increases. The Congressional Budget Office reported that such cuts could not be achieved without slashing Medicare, Medicaid, or children\'92s health programs, despite Republican claims to the contrary. In this setting, the legislature looked less like an independent branch weighing evidence and more like a theater for executive messaging and partisan discipline.\
\
Civil rights and the meaning of citizenship were also reshaped. On March 1, Trump signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States and revoking a Clinton\uc0\u8209 era order that had required agencies and federally funded organizations to provide language assistance to people with limited English proficiency. The order did not immediately ban multilingual services, but it removed a federal mandate that had anchored them. In practice, it signaled that access to government would be easier for native English speakers and harder for others. Immigration enforcement intensified. The administration mobilized officers from nearly every federal law enforcement agency and the military to carry out mass deportations, reopened a migrant family detention center in Texas, and celebrated a clampdown on asylum in the congressional address. A German tourist with valid documents was detained for over a month, including eight days in solitary confinement, after being accused of intending to work illegally. Plans to deport hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians with temporary legal status, though later reversed, showed how even legally present refugees could be treated as expendable.\
\
The administration\'92s approach to universities and protest added another layer to this stratification. Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent letters to Georgetown Law and later Georgetown University demanding an immediate end to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, and warning that his office would not hire students or affiliates from institutions that continued such programs. The Justice Department opened a Title VII investigation into the University of California system over alleged antisemitic hostile work environments tied to Gaza protests. The administration cut off $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing failure to combat antisemitism, and signaled that more institutions could face similar treatment. On social media, Trump threatened to halt federal funding to colleges that allowed \'93illegal protests\'94 and to expel or arrest student \'93agitators.\'94 At the same time, a donor\uc0\u8209 funded pastor traveled the country disrupting school board meetings to demand removal of LGBTQ\u8209 inclusive books, using inflammatory rhetoric and viral videos to frame himself as a persecuted truth\u8209 teller. These actions used hiring pipelines, investigations, and funding streams to pressure educational institutions to narrow the range of acceptable ideas and identities.\
\
Information and memory were contested on other fronts as well. The administration delayed release of a report on Jeffrey Epstein, raising questions about whether politically sensitive findings were being suppressed. Trump requested that the original Declaration of Independence be moved from its secure public display to the Oval Office, a symbolic act that would place a shared national artifact under personal control. A Pentagon spokesperson, Kingsley Wilson, tweeted comments disputing the innocence of Leo Frank, a Jewish businessman lynched in 1915, echoing white\uc0\u8209 supremacist talking points and drawing condemnation from the Anti\u8209 Defamation League. The Inter\u8209 American Foundation\'92s website went dark after its leadership change, erasing public access to information about U.S. development projects. The Social Security Administration banned employees from accessing news websites on work devices, even when they used them for job\u8209 related research. In the media sphere, Newsmax disclosed a $40 million settlement with Smartmatic over false claims that its voting machines had hacked the 2020 election, a reminder that disinformation can carry legal costs even as it shapes public belief. Meanwhile, Trump\'92s own address to Congress, filled with falsehoods, showed that the highest office in the land was willing to treat truth as optional.\
\
Despite these pressures, civil society and some state institutions showed resilience. In Iowa, thousands protested a bill that would strip civil\uc0\u8209 rights protections from transgender people. In Montana, Republican and Democratic lawmakers joined to defeat two extreme anti\u8209 trans bills\'97one banning drag shows and Pride marches, the other allowing the state to remove trans children from their parents. Trans representatives Zooey Zephyr and SJ Howell spoke on the floor about the bills\'92 implications for gender nonconformity and family integrity, and their arguments helped sway enough Republicans to block the measures. Bishop William Barber prepared a march from St. Mark\'92s Episcopal Church to the Supreme Court, framing resistance to injustice as a moral obligation. The 50501 movement organized protests across the country against policies seen as undermining democracy and human rights. These actions did not stop federal executive orders or agency purges, but they kept alive alternative visions of law and community.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 7, several processes were already in motion. The SAVE Act, a voting bill expected to disenfranchise millions, especially women whose names changed after marriage, was scheduled for votes in both chambers. Courts were set to hold further hearings on the legality of mass federal firings, the shutdown of the CFPB, and Alabama\'92s attempt to prosecute those helping women travel for abortions. The Supreme Court\'92s foreign\uc0\u8209 aid rulings required the administration to clarify how it would comply, even as the White House continued to survey aid projects and ask them to justify their work. The State Department was preparing to close a dozen consulates in Europe and cut its workforce by at least 10 percent, while hundreds of career diplomats had already resigned. The World Radiocommunication Conference Advisory Committee and the Federal Election Commission had scheduled meetings that would shape technical standards and enforcement in communications and elections. These were not speculative risks; they were concrete decisions already queued in the machinery of government.\
\
By the close of Week 7, the Democracy Clock remained at 7:52 p.m. in public view, but the underlying time had edged another half minute toward midnight. The week matters because it shows how a democracy can be weakened not only by spectacular events, but by the steady use of lawful tools for illiberal ends. Executive orders, budget resolutions, personnel decisions, and regulatory choices\'97each defensible in isolation\'97combined to politicize the civil service, entrench crony capitalism, and stratify citizenship. Courts, inspectors, and protesters slowed some of these moves, and in a few cases reversed them, but they did so against a backdrop of growing pressure and retaliation. The story of Week 7 is not of institutions collapsing, but of institutions being repurposed. That is why the clock moved, even if the minute hand did not yet jump. The official end\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 period time remains 7:52 p.m., but the light outside the window is a little dimmer than it was seven days before.\
