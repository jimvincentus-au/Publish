Internal documents suggest that the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have already used the tool for regulatory decisions. The White House has not yet approved any specific plan, and the initiative is in its early stages.",

This move follows threats to withdraw funding from institutions deemed to inadequately address campus antisemitism. The training, criticized for equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, has been implemented at universities like Northwestern, Columbia, and Harvard. Critics argue it stifles legitimate criticism of Israel and imposes a one-sided narrative. The Department of Education has investigated over 60 universities for potential Title VI violations related to discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and religion.",
