The dismissal was justified by Bove as necessary to prevent interference with Adams' governance and to support federal immigration initiatives. The decision prompted resignations from several prosecutors, including the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, who opposed the dismissal.",
