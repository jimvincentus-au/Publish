Week 46 of Trump’s second term registered almost no visible movement on the Democracy Clock, but the underlying structure shifted. The presidency turned clemency into a shield for corrupt elites and foreign power brokers, while a Reuters-documented retaliation campaign showed law used as a weapon against critics. Simultaneously, immigration policy hardened into group-based exclusion: threats to strip citizenship, a blanket asylum freeze, nationality-based re-reviews, expanded travel bans, and aggressive raids that sometimes ignored court orders. Security forces were pushed toward regime protection, from alleged war-crime-level narco-boat strikes to politicized FBI priorities and the rollback of protections for LGBTQ+ prisoners. Economic and foreign policy fused with Trump-family business interests, and key economic indicators were suppressed even as a “media offenders” site targeted critical outlets. Courts and Congress offered uneven resistance, and transparency around Epstein files and January 6 violence advanced, but the week’s through-line was normalization of impunity and stratified citizenship.
