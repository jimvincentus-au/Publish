Week 22 charts a dense, structural tightening of executive power and information control. Immigration raids in Democratic-led cities, the arrest of New York comptroller Brad Lander, and the detention of journalists and activists showed law used as a weapon rather than a limit. Trump federalized the California National Guard over the governor’s objections, deployed marines against largely peaceful “No Kings” protests, and staged a $40 million, corporate-sponsored military parade in Washington as a personal backdrop. Inside the state, agencies were bent toward private and partisan ends: environmental enforcement halted for fossil fuel firms, coal plants ordered to stay open, crypto cases dropped as Trump-linked ventures flourished, and civil service protections hollowed out at the CDC, VA, NRC, and Voice of America. Oversight and memory institutions—from detention-center access to archives, museums, and public broadcasting—were constrained or defunded, even as courts and Congress mounted scattered resistance. The Democracy Clock moved from 10:54 to 10:58 p.m., recording a sharper tilt toward power without witnesses.
