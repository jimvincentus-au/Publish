Week 21 of Trump’s second term compressed the story of American democracy into Los Angeles. Immigration raids conducted with counterinsurgency tactics triggered protests that the White House recast as an “invasion,” justifying the federalization of thousands of National Guard troops and the deployment of Marines over state and local objections. Courts briefly checked these moves, but emergency stays and appellate delays left executive power effectively unrestrained on the ground. Law was wielded against protesters, immigrants, journalists, and even members of Congress, while oversight visits were blocked and a senator was handcuffed by federal agents. Universities, media outlets, and cultural institutions faced funding threats and politicized investigations, as citizenship rights were stratified by origin, identity, and belief. Environmental and economic policy tilted further toward deregulated, captured agencies. Pockets of resistance—from state lawsuits to mass “No Kings” protests—slowed but did not reverse the trend. The Democracy Clock moved 4.2 minutes later, to 10:54 p.m., reflecting a hardened pattern rather than a single shock.
