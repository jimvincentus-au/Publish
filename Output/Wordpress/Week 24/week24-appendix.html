<h1>Week 24 Appendix: Hardwiring Inequality as Governance</h1>
<p><em>A megabill, a compliant Court, and a militarized border quietly rewrote who counts, who pays, and who can still say no.</em></p>
<p>This week marks a major structural lurch toward authoritarian governance, anchored by passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill and a cluster of Supreme Court decisions expanding executive impunity and constraining judicial checks. Fiscal and social policy were aggressively re-engineered to favor capital over labor and natives over immigrants, with deep, long-horizon cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare, while massively expanding ICE, detention infrastructure, and defense spending. Simultaneously, the Court narrowed nationwide injunctions and reaffirmed sweeping presidential immunity, sharply weakening courts as a counterweight. Law enforcement and immigration tools were overtly weaponized against political opponents, local officials, journalists, and even judges, while DOJ denaturalization guidance and birthright-citizenship maneuvers stratified citizenship itself. Information control intensified through threats to CNN, source-compulsion talk, shutdown of a federal climate site, and politicized appointments. A few judicial and state-level pushbacks on asylum, TPS, HHS firings, and data-sharing show residual resistance, but the net effect is a coordinated consolidation of executive-centered, exclusionary, and oligarchic rule, with multiple traits of democratic decay both worsened and entrenched in law.</p>
