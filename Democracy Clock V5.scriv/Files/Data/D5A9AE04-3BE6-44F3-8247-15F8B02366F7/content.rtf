\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 7 of Trump\'92s second term traced a dense pattern of consolidation rather than a single rupture. The administration accelerated its hollowing of the civil service, driving mass resignations at State, sidelining the CFPB, and planning deep cuts at IRS, VA, and Social Security, even as the Merit Systems Protection Board and courts clawed back some illegal firings. Universities and schools became central targets: Georgetown and Columbia faced federal threats to funding and hiring pipelines, while a donor-backed book-banning tour turned local school boards into ideological battlegrounds. Law and data were redeployed as weapons\'97AI-assisted visa revocations for foreign students, punitive tweaks to Public Service Loan Forgiveness, an executive order singling out Perkins Coie, and algorithmic surveillance that left elite misconduct opaque. Tariff whiplash and a politicized \'93crypto reserve\'94 fused economic chaos with insider enrichment. Courts, state legislatures, and civil society mounted visible resistance, but mostly slowed rather than reversed a tightening vise. The Democracy Clock\'92s hands stayed at 7:44 p.m., even as its gears crept forward.\
