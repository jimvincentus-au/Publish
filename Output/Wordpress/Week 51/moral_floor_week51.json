    "summary": "This week saw a significant erosion of the moral floor, with serious breaches in character, ethics, restraint, and truthfulness. The administration's actions, particularly regarding military intervention in Venezuela and aggressive immigration enforcement, exemplified a disregard for democratic norms and accountability. While there were instances of institutional pushback, they were largely reactive and insufficient to counter the overarching trend of power consolidation and erosion of checks and balances.",

    "narrative": "The moral floor continues to deteriorate, with the executive branch increasingly treating public institutions as extensions of personal power. This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the slight inward movement of the Democracy Clock.",
