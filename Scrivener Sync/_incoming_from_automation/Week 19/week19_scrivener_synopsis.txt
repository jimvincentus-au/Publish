Week 19 of Trump’s second term marked a consolidation of hierarchy inside still-functioning institutions. The administration escalated its campaign against universities, revoking Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students, cutting roughly $100 million in contracts, and demanding protest and coursework data, only to pivot to mandatory social media screening when courts intervened. Immigration policy hardened into quotas and new architecture: ICE was ordered to triple daily arrests, an Office of Remigration was announced, and the Supreme Court cleared the way to strip protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants. At the same time, clemency and corporate settlements signaled that wealth and proximity to power could purchase legal outcomes, from pardons for corrupt officials and reality TV stars to a lenient non‑prosecution deal for Boeing. Public media and civic education came under direct pressure, with funding cuts to NPR and PBS and conspiracy‑laden curricula in Oklahoma. Judges, parents, journalists, and students fought back, but the Democracy Clock’s move from 10:40 p.m. to 10:46 p.m. captured a structural tightening of who belongs and who does not.
