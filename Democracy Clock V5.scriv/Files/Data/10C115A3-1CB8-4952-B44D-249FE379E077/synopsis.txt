Trump’s second term opens with a shock wave. In five days, the presidency declares overlapping emergencies, suspends asylum and refugee programs, militarizes the southern border, and attempts by executive order to narrow birthright citizenship. Immigration becomes the proving ground for a broader project: stratifying membership, normalizing rule by decree, and forcing courts to chase after faits accomplis. Inside the state, Schedule F–style reclassification, the creation of DOGE under Elon Musk, and a purge of inspectors general politicize the civil service and hollow out watchdogs. Law enforcement is redirected toward sanctuary officials and prior administrations, while mass pardons for January 6 offenders and anti‑abortion activists signal impunity for loyalists. Abroad, exits from Paris and WHO and sweeping aid freezes shrink multilateral constraints. Crypto schemes, foreign Trump‑branded projects, and deregulatory orders fuse public authority with private enrichment. Courts, states, and civil society mount early resistance, but the Democracy Clock jumps seven minutes toward nightfall.
