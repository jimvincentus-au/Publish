Week 6 of Trump’s second term registered only a 0.2‑minute shift on the Democracy Clock, from 7:51 to 7:52 p.m., but the institutional movement was far larger. The White House and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency tightened control over federal payments, data, and personnel, ordering mass layoff plans and purging scientific agencies while courts scrambled to block the most brazen firings and data grabs. Immigration policy became a proving ground for stratified citizenship: mass‑deportation pledges, Guantánamo detention, biometric registries, and a $5 million “gold card” path to citizenship sorted people by wealth, origin, and identity. Law and regulation bent toward donors and insiders as the SEC retreated from cases involving major pro‑Trump crypto backers and Jared Kushner’s foreign‑funded ventures shaped Gaza and Ukraine policy. Simultaneously, the administration moved against transgender people and DEI infrastructure, shuttered civil‑rights oversight, and tightened control over media access, language, and archives. Courts, unions, governors, protesters, and foreign consumers mounted resistance, but largely in reaction to a state being refitted for patronage and personal rule.
