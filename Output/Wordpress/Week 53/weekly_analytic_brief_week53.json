    "Justice Department and DHS move deeper into partisan enforcement, prioritizing immigration crackdowns, retaliatory investigations, and selective non-enforcement (Epstein files, Renee Good) over neutral application of law.",
    "The federal judiciary shows both resistance and vulnerability: some judges block abuses (protester protections, unlawful appointments), but appellate stays and intimidation campaigns against judges narrow effective checks.",
    "Congress remains divided and partially performative: it funds DHS/ICE and declines to constrain Venezuela deployments, yet also hosts Jack Smith\u2019s testimony and pursues bipartisan efforts to block Greenland-related tariffs.",
    "Executive agencies are repurposed ideologically: CDC, NIH, HUD, FCC, and foreign aid machinery are steered away from harm reduction, DEI, climate cooperation, and global health toward culture-war and deregulatory priorities.",
    "International architecture is destabilized: withdrawal from WHO, sanctions on ICC judges, and the pay-to-play Board of Peace directly undercut UN-centered multilateralism and strain NATO and EU relationships."

  "oddities_or_open_questions": [
    "Financial markets appear to be one of the few effective constraints on Greenland-related escalation; how durable is this market veto if political incentives push toward renewed confrontation?",
    "The UN Security Council\u2019s prior endorsement of the Gaza-focused Board of Peace has been repurposed into a broader Trump-centric club\u2014how much legal and political leverage does that initial resolution still confer?",
    "Civil resistance capacity is unusually high (national walkouts, Minnesota blackout, general strike spread), but it is unclear whether this mobilization can translate into institutional reforms under intensifying repression."

  "summary": "This was an acute rupture week: the presidency is openly using law enforcement, foreign policy, and regulatory power as instruments of personal rule, while civil society mounts unusually large, coordinated resistance. Structurally, the heaviest pressure falls on rule-of-law traits: DOJ and ICE are weaponized against immigrants, state officials, protesters, journalists, and disfavored law firms, while elite financial and crypto actors receive pardons, deregulation, and bespoke legislation. Emergency logic and militarized responses (Insurrection Act threats, troop alerts, global strikes from Venezuela to Iran) normalize exceptional powers. Federal power is concentrated and targeted at blue jurisdictions (Minnesota, sanctuary cities) and vulnerable groups (immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, minorities, pregnant women), entrenching stratified citizenship. Information manipulation escalates: AI-altered protest images, doctored narratives about ICE abuses, misuse of Social Security data for voter-fraud myths, and continued election lies. Internationally, the \"Board of Peace,\" Greenland brinkmanship, and sanctions on ICC judges signal an attempt to replace rules-based multilateralism with a Trump-centered patronage system. Countervailing forces\u2014federal judges, congressional oversight, mass walkouts, and state-level resistance\u2014are visible but outmatched by the breadth and speed of executive-driven decay.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Systematic weaponization of law and law enforcement: DOJ, ICE, and courts are repeatedly used to target political opponents, immigrants, protesters, and disfavored lawyers while shielding allies and donors from accountability.",
    "Normalization of emergency and militarized governance: threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, large federal agent surges, and multi-theater foreign strikes embed crisis logic into routine policy and domestic protest management.",
    "Stratified citizenship and punitive immigration regime: Venezuelans, Somalis, Iranians, and mixed-status families face TPS terminations, warrantless raids, child detentions, and lethal neglect, making unequal protection a core feature.",
    "Information control through manipulation and intimidation: AI-altered protest photos, doctored narratives about ICE, attacks on polls and media, and misuse of government data for voter-fraud myths erode a shared factual baseline.",
    "Crony capitalism and personal enrichment via state power: crypto deregulation, the Genius Act, selective pardons, and captured commissions show economic policy and oversight being bent toward Trump-linked business interests."
