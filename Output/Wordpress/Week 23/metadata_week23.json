    "square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden table: a cracked judge\u2019s gavel, a stack of redacted intelligence reports, a tarnished military medal, and a press badge with its lanyard cut. Beside them sits a small desk clock frozen at just after eight, its glass slightly shattered. In the background, blurred bars evoke a detention facility, and a faint American flag hangs in partial shadow. Painterly, realistic style, rich textures, subdued color palette.",
    "wide": "A dusk cityscape blending Washington, D.C. landmarks with distant explosions on a hazy horizon, the Capitol dome dimmed while the White House glows brightly. In the foreground, a line of masked federal agents and soldiers in mixed riot and military gear move through a residential street, past shuttered homes and a flickering newsstand. Overhead, surveillance drones and helicopters circle. A large, old-fashioned clock face is faintly superimposed in the sky, its hands edging past eight, suggesting time running forward for democracy under strain. Painterly, realistic style, moody, with strong contrasts of light and shadow."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 23 of Trump\u2019s second term moved the Democracy Clock from 8:00 to 8:01 p.m., a modest 1.2\u2011minute shift that belied a sharp consolidation of power. The president ordered large-scale airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites without congressional authorization, then managed intelligence and briefings to sell the operation as a \u201cspectacular success\u201d while sidelining contrary assessments and restricting classified access. At home, ICE and DHS intensified masked raids and wrongful detentions, backed by federalized Guard and Marines in Los Angeles and a rapidly expanding detention archipelago, from \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d in the Everglades to a new CoreCivic mega-facility. Courts both resisted and enabled this trajectory: whistleblowers described DOJ pressure to ignore injunctions even as the Supreme Court narrowed nationwide remedies and eased harsh deportations. Media, universities, and vaccine policy bodies were purged or coerced, while citizenship and safety grew more contingent on origin, ideology, and identity. Routine rulemaking continued, but under a moral floor described as collapsing.",
