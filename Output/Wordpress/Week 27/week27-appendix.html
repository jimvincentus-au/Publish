<h1>Week 27 Appendix: Databases and Detention as Governance</h1>
<p><em>A week when immigration camps, crypto reserves, and AI propaganda showed how law, money, and information are being refitted to serve power first.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a coordinated information struggle around legitimacy and accountability. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fall on civil service independence, regulatory integrity, immigration enforcement, and the information ecosystem. Mass firings and restructurings at State, EPA, USDA, DOJ, and ICE, combined with Supreme Court stays and RIF approvals, deepen capture of the bureaucracy (traits 1, 16, 22). Immigration policy becomes a central vector of authoritarian drift: expanded detention infrastructure, National Guard deployments, masked raids, Medicaid data-sharing, and courthouse arrests normalize rights-violating enforcement against non‑citizens (traits 4, 9, 11, 46, 47). Parallel moves weaponize the justice system against political enemies (Obama, Schiff) while rolling back police-reform consent decrees and birthright citizenship, even as some courts push back (traits 4, 14, 51). On the information front, the White House seizes control of the press pool, bans the Wall Street Journal, leverages mergers, and floods discourse with AI fakes and treason accusations, while selectively releasing MLK and Clinton files to distract from Epstein records (traits 42–43, 52–53, 58–60). A few countervailing judicial and legislative actions appear, but they are outweighed by systemic entrenchment.</p>
