The fifth week of Trump’s second term read less like a series of disputes and more like a coordinated test of how much of the state could be bent at once. The same names and tools recurred across domains: executive orders, emergency language, a Musk-led efficiency project, and a Justice Department willing to lean on its own lawyers. Agencies that once stood apart from day-to-day politics were pulled into the orbit of a single project. The pattern was not subtle. It was dense.

At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:50 p.m. By the end of Week 5, it had moved to 7:51 p.m., a net shift of 1.3 minutes. The numerical change was small, but it captured a week in which the tools of government were reconfigured rather than merely used. Mass firings, spending freezes, and data seizures widened the space for unilateral action. Courts and Congress still appeared, but more often as background conditions than as active checks. The movement came from the way power was rearranged inside the state.

The clearest expression of that rearrangement was the rise of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, as a parallel center of authority. Trump’s order empowering a Musk-led DOGE committee to shrink the federal workforce delegated sweeping reduction powers to an unelected body, outside normal confirmation and civil service channels. That order did not just authorize cuts. It changed who decided which public functions mattered, and it did so without the usual layers of oversight that accompany such choices.

The consequences spread quickly through health and safety agencies. The administration announced mass layoffs in federal health agencies, including an entire class of Epidemic Intelligence Service officers at CDC and staff at HHS. These were the people trained to track outbreaks and manage crises. At the same time, USDA and FDA leadership fired about twenty staff involved in oversight of Neuralink, a company closely associated with Musk. The pattern was not random austerity. It was targeted removal of expertise in places where public health and private power intersected.

DOGE’s reach extended into transportation and environmental stewardship. Large layoffs hit the Forest Service and National Park Service, thinning the ranks of those who manage public lands and wildfires. Hundreds of FAA technical employees responsible for air traffic control systems were terminated, even as SpaceX representatives were invited into the FAA command center to review air traffic systems. The same week, OSHA rescinded contractor protections and the administration canceled collective bargaining agreements with federal unions, then fired thousands of probationary federal employees and pressured mass resignations with buyout offers. The workforce that remained was smaller, less secure, and more exposed to political direction. It was easier to bend.

Foreign aid and global health capacity were also pulled into the purge. USAID was allowed to furlough over 2,000 workers after a federal judge declined to block the reductions, weakening development programs at a moment of global instability. Across agencies like USAID, USDA, and CDC, layoffs fell on veterans, early-career staff, and specialized personnel. There was one partial retreat: planned firings of more than 300 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were reversed after backlash, a reminder that even in a purge, some lines could still be pushed back. But the overall direction was clear. Courts upheld Musk’s voluntary buyout scheme and refused to halt mass firings, while only occasionally stepping in to protect a narrow set of DEI-linked intelligence staff.

These moves did more than trim budgets. They politicized who could serve and hollowed out the state’s ability to carry out basic tasks. Civil service protections, already fragile, were weakened by judicial deference to executive claims of efficiency. The winners were those closest to the DOGE project and the White House. The losers were the agencies that manage disease, air safety, forests, and foreign aid, and the public that depends on them.

Alongside the personnel purge came a more direct assertion of unilateral control over money and rules. Trump imposed a federal spending freeze on congressionally appropriated funds, despite statutory obligations to spend them. The freeze functioned as an illegal impoundment, allowing the White House to reshape policy by withholding money rather than by changing law. A companion DOGE deregulatory order invited agencies to declare existing rules unconstitutional or overbroad and to stop enforcing them, effectively letting the executive branch reinterpret statutes on its own.

The same logic appeared in an order bringing independent regulatory agencies under White House review. Bodies that had been designed to sit at some distance from presidential politics were told to submit their rules to OIRA and accept presidential oversight. Plans to disband the USPS governing board and shift control of the Postal Service to the Commerce Secretary pointed in the same direction: quasi-independent institutions were to be folded into the executive chain of command. Trump also targeted entities like the U.S. Institute of Peace and development foundations for downsizing or elimination, shrinking the parts of government that support diplomacy and long-term development.

These structural moves were reinforced by defiance of the judiciary. The administration continued contested policies despite injunctions on birthright citizenship limits and funding freezes, pushing toward a constitutional confrontation over compliance. At the same time, the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court for permission to fire the head of the Office of Special Counsel, framing protections for whistleblowers as an impermissible check on presidential power. A federal judge declined to block DOGE’s access to Education Department data systems, citing efficiency, even as other courts temporarily protected the whistleblower watchdog and halted the firing of some DEI staff in intelligence agencies. Appeals courts twice refused to revive an executive order ending birthright citizenship for many children of noncitizens, affirming the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee. These rulings felt like islands in a larger sea of executive assertion.

Emergency language and industrial policy were folded into this pattern. The administration announced plans to fast-track hundreds of fossil fuel permits under an “energy emergency,” allowing developers to bypass environmental review and public input. Funding for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act implementation was frozen, undercutting congressionally approved efforts to support electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing. In each case, the White House used control over timing and implementation to redirect policy without changing the underlying statutes. Congress’s power of the purse and the courts’ authority to interpret law remained on paper, but their practical grip weakened.

If DOGE and impoundment reconfigured the machinery of administration, the Justice Department’s choices reshaped the meaning of law itself. Inside DOJ, leadership coerced Public Integrity lawyers to drop a corruption indictment against New York mayor Eric Adams. Prosecutors were told to dismiss the case or face removal. Several resigned rather than comply. The head of the Criminal Division, Denise Cheung, also resigned after refusing to open a politically driven investigation into a Biden-era contract. These departures marked a shift from independent prosecutorial judgment to overt political direction.

At the same time, Trump ordered the firing of all remaining Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys in one sweep, further aligning federal prosecution with presidential loyalty. The move came as the administration unlawfully fired pro-worker NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, weakening labor enforcement. On the other side of the ledger, the criminal justice system in New York charged five people with depraved-indifference murder in the killing of transgender man Sam Nordquist, showing that in some venues, serious crimes were still pursued. The asymmetry was stark. Corruption cases against politically useful figures were dropped, while enforcement tools were sharpened against immigrants, workers, and critics.

The clearest signal of how the regime viewed political violence came at CPAC. Trump issued mass pardons for January 6 Capitol attackers and celebrated them from the stage. Those who had used force against Congress were recast as honored guests. The message was that violence in service of the regime would not only be forgiven but praised. Combined with DOJ’s selective enforcement posture and the push to fire oversight officials, this celebration of January 6 lowered deterrence for future attacks on democratic institutions.

Immigration enforcement became another arena where law served as a weapon rather than a limit. Trump threatened to revoke protections for Ukrainians under the Uniting for Ukraine program and ordered a review of Temporary Protected Status for about a million people, putting lawful residents’ status at risk. An order restricting federal benefits for undocumented immigrants hardened a tiered system of access to public goods based on legal status, later echoed in a $175 billion deportation budget and benefit cuts that entrenched a punitive regime.

The administration briefly stripped legal aid from unaccompanied immigrant children in immigration proceedings, only to reverse course after backlash, illustrating how executive discretion could abruptly curtail due process for the most vulnerable. ICE agents detained immigrants at courthouses and mandatory check-ins, including DACA recipients, weaponizing enforcement against those who complied with legal processes. The Justice Department fired more than two dozen immigration judges and candidates amid a heavy case backlog, and ICE leadership was reshuffled to accelerate deportations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission moved to dismiss gender-identity discrimination cases, narrowing protections for transgender workers. Together, these actions deepened a stratified system in which immigration status and identity shaped access to rights, even as courts blocked attempts to end birthright citizenship.

The week also saw a more direct challenge to the norm of limited presidential tenure. Trump publicly mused about running for a third term and questioned constitutional limits, normalizing the idea of extended personal rule. At CPAC, Steve Bannon and allied figures went further, promoting a constitutional change to allow Trump a third term. What had once been speculative talk became an organized project. This push unfolded against the backdrop of a 2023 law requiring congressional approval or a Senate supermajority for any withdrawal from NATO, a guardrail Congress had erected in anticipation of executive overreach on alliances. That earlier law showed that some institutions had tried to anticipate threats. The third-term project suggested that those guardrails were now being tested in more direct ways.

The same CPAC stage that hosted calls for term-limit changes also hosted the celebration of January 6 pardons. The pairing was telling. Extending personal rule and rewarding anti-democratic violence were presented as part of the same political vision. The winners in this vision were those loyal to Trump and aligned media and activist networks. The losers were the norms of peaceful rotation of power and the expectation that attacks on Congress would be punished, not honored.

Control over information and data formed another pillar of the week’s developments. The White House and Trump administration banned Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and key briefings after AP refused to adopt the term “Gulf of America” for the Gulf of Mexico. AP responded with a federal lawsuit challenging its exclusion, arguing that access could not be conditioned on adopting official language. Elon Musk added to the pressure by publicly calling for imprisonment of 60 Minutes journalists who were critical of the administration, contributing to a climate of intimidation around investigative reporting.

At the same time, DOGE and its allies moved to seize control of sensitive data. DOGE representatives gained access to CDC and CMS payment and contracting systems, blurring the line between private actors and state data control. The department pushed for access to IRS taxpayer systems, framed as an anti-waste measure, and the White House defended this access with unsubstantiated claims of massive savings. Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren demanded details from the acting IRS commissioner, seeking to clarify whether tax databases were being weaponized. Within the Social Security Administration, acting commissioner Michelle King resigned rather than grant DOGE access to beneficiary data, and General Services Administration staff quit rather than enable a Musk ally’s request for Notify.gov access, a system capable of texting the public en masse.

Courts did not consistently restrain these moves. A federal judge declined to block DOGE’s access to Education Department data systems, citing efficiency, even as other institutions raised alarms. Operation Whirlwind, run under new D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, sent letters to lawmakers and launched investigations into “threats” against officials, including criticism of Musk and DOGE. By linking criticism to potential criminal conduct, the operation blurred the line between protected speech and prosecutable threats. In this environment, RFK Jr., serving as HHS Secretary, promoted anti-vaccine rhetoric and questioned the childhood schedule, while Congressman Nick Begich amplified false DOGE claims about Social Security beneficiaries and supposed fraud. Regime-aligned disinformation filled the space created by weakened independent media and concentrated data power.

Beneath these immediate fights lay a broader project to rewrite civic education, culture, and public memory. In Department of Defense schools, the education authority ordered curriculum changes and book removals targeting materials on gender, sexuality, Black history, and transgender figures. Students at a DoD middle school in Germany walked out during a visit by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to protest DEI purges, signaling youth resistance to top-down ideological control. OSHA leadership ordered the destruction of eighteen workplace safety publications, many flagged simply for containing words like “diversity” or “gender,” reducing access to guidance that protects workers. The loss was quiet but real.

The National Park Service removed transgender references from Stonewall National Monument webpages, narrowing public memory of the uprising and erasing the role of trans people in LGBTQ+ history. Protesters in New York City demonstrated against the removal of LGBTQ+ references from Stonewall materials, defending visibility against federal attempts to rewrite queer history. Elsewhere, the administration scrubbed mentions of Black people from some federal websites during Black History Month, undermining recognition of Black Americans’ contributions. The National Endowment for the Arts canceled DEI-focused grants and banned programs that promote DEI or “gender ideology,” redirecting cultural funding away from marginalized communities.

High culture was not spared. The administration took over the Kennedy Center, replacing its board with Trump allies and appointing an unqualified president, politicizing a major arts institution. Trump asserted power to rename major geographic features by executive order, declaring “Gulf of America Day” and claiming unilateral authority to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali. He misrepresented the Fourteenth Amendment on social media, falsely claiming it applied only to formerly enslaved people, to support efforts to curtail birthright citizenship. State Department directives canceled non-mission-critical media subscriptions worldwide, limiting diplomats’ access to diverse information sources. Across websites, curricula, monuments, and grants, references to climate, DEI, Black history, and LGBTQ+ people were scrubbed. Public commentary, including reflections on presidential honesty and disinformation on Presidents Day, tried to place these changes in historical context, but the structural direction was one of narrowing stories and curated memory.

Economic policy during the week reinforced these shifts in power and memory by redistributing burdens downward. House Republicans advanced a budget blueprint with deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs while extending tax breaks for the wealthy. Trump endorsed a competing House budget that added trillions in tax-cut-driven deficits and mandated large benefit cuts. The administration proposed further reductions to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food aid, often justified by inflated or misleading claims of waste and fraud. DOGE and the White House touted supposed savings from contract cancellations, misreporting an $8 million contract as $8 billion to claim $16 billion in savings. These numbers were debunked, but they served their purpose in public messaging.

Climate and industrial policy were rolled back in tandem. Environmental protections were weakened and fossil fuel expansion promoted through early-term orders to increase drilling and cut safeguards. The “energy emergency” fast-track allowed hundreds of fossil projects to bypass environmental review and public input. Climate-related research grants were cut, and the word “climate” was scrubbed from programs, weakening the knowledge base for policy. Funding for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act implementation was frozen, undercutting efforts to build domestic manufacturing and clean energy capacity. The administration moved to revoke federal approval for New York City’s congestion pricing plan, using federal leverage to block a local environmental and revenue policy. Elon Musk called for defunding the International Space Station after a dispute with an astronaut commander, highlighting how private actors sought to redirect public resources toward their own ventures.

Trade and foreign policy took on a transactional, extractive cast. The administration proposed that the United States gain access to half of Ukraine’s mineral resources in exchange for support, framing security assistance as a resource deal with a vulnerable ally. Plans for new tariffs risked a trade war, and consumer confidence dropped sharply, with survey researchers linking the decline to tariff policies. At the same time, the administration considered repealing tariffs on China in exchange for purchase promises and floated halving U.S. and Chinese military spending, despite opaque Chinese budgets. These moves risked weakening U.S. capabilities in ways that favored authoritarian rivals. State-level climate superfund laws in Vermont and New York, which sought to charge fossil fuel firms for damages, faced immediate lawsuits from red-state attorneys general and oil trade groups, illustrating how even modest efforts to rebalance costs from the public to polluters were contested.

Against this backdrop, resistance emerged but remained fragmented. Democratic leaders and activists organized nationwide protests against DOGE budget cuts, rallying outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships. Federal workers and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led protests outside SpaceX, with more than a thousand employees highlighting fears of privatization and billionaire capture of public policy. Large, diffuse demonstrations across the country decried perceived attacks on democracy and alliances. At Stonewall and in DoD schools, localized actions—protests over LGBTQ+ erasure and student walkouts against DEI purges—showed that the cultural project of rewriting memory was contested.

Inside institutions, some officials chose resignation over compliance. Michelle King left the Social Security Administration rather than hand over beneficiary data to DOGE. GSA staff resigned rather than grant Notify.gov access to a Musk ally. Denise Cheung and other DOJ lawyers walked away rather than pursue baseless or politically driven cases. Unions sued over mass federal workforce reductions and the cancellation of collective bargaining agreements. AP went to court over its exclusion from White House venues. Senators Wyden and Warren pressed the IRS on DOGE’s access to taxpayer data. Federal judges temporarily blocked the firing of DEI staff in intelligence agencies and preserved the whistleblower watchdog’s position, while the National Archives and FOIA Advisory Committee scheduled a public meeting to maintain a venue for transparency. The Environmental Protection Agency continued to issue technical corrections, comment extensions, and environmental impact notices, keeping some procedural integrity alive.

Yet these efforts, while real, did not cohere into a force capable of reversing the broader drift. Courts more often deferred than intervened. Congress was locked in brinkmanship over budgets shaped by the White House. Protests were large but scattered across issues and geographies. Resignations removed pockets of resistance from inside agencies, sometimes leaving the structures they opposed easier to capture. The week’s changes to staffing, spending, data control, and public memory moved faster than the mechanisms available to contest them.

In the arc of the term, Week 5 deepened the sense that the struggle was no longer over single policies but over the shape of the state itself. The tools of administration—who is hired and fired, which funds flow, what data is seen, what history is told—were used to entrench a more personal, less accountable form of rule. Rights and procedures remained on paper, and pockets of resistance showed they still had life. But using them now demanded more courage, more coordination, and more time than the week allowed. The erosion advanced not through a single rupture, but through the steady normalization of a government that serves power first and the public only as an afterthought.
