<h1>Week 31 Appendix: Emergency as Governing Method</h1>
<p><em>In Washington, elections, immigration, and memory, the administration treated emergency powers and loyal law as routine tools of rule, not rare exceptions.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with multiple branches and levels of government pulled into a coordinated project of centralizing power around the executive and its ideological program. The most intense pressures fell on rule-of-law structures, civil-military boundaries, and electoral integrity. Trump’s blanket pardons for January 6 offenders, politicized prosecutions, and unlawful appointments, combined with the federalization and arming of D.C. police and National Guard, show law and security institutions being repurposed to protect the regime and punish opponents. Simultaneously, aggressive gerrymanders in Texas and retaliatory mid-decade redistricting in California, plus moves to end mail-in voting and tighten registration, push elections toward managed competition. Immigration and visa policy became a broad tool of ideological sorting and intimidation, while public-health and scientific agencies were attacked or captured to align data and policy with political narratives. There were pockets of resistance—federal courts checking some excesses, civil servants and state officials suing or protesting—but these functioned as defensive rear-guard actions against a rapidly expanding architecture of executive dominance and militarized domestic governance.</p>
