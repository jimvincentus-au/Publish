Week 6 of Trump’s second term marks a shift from episodic abuse to structural rewiring. Through executive orders and memos, the new Department of Government Efficiency, effectively run by Elon Musk, gains veto power over federal spending and workforce decisions, sidelining Congress, inspectors general, and traditional budget offices. A 30‑day freeze on government credit cards and suspended NIH grants turn public health into collateral damage for central control. Simultaneously, the civil service is hollowed out through mass‑firing plans, reclassification of career posts, and targeted purges at agencies like NOAA, USAID, and Social Security. Law is redeployed as protection for allies and punishment for critics: mass pardons for January 6 offenders, crypto prosecutions quietly abandoned after large donations, and selective Epstein disclosures to friendly influencers. Citizenship and protection are stratified by wealth, identity, and origin, while independent media and memory are curated to flatter power. Courts and civil society win scattered injunctions and stage protests and boycotts, but the Democracy Clock’s jump from 8:47 to 9:12 p.m. records a regime whose operating system now runs on loyalty, money, and managed chaos.
