Week 20 of Trump’s second term marked a shift from accumulating power to sorting and targeting it. Immigration policy and enforcement led the way: humanitarian paroles were stripped from hundreds of thousands, a new Office of Remigration signaled expulsion over refuge, and record ICE raids—with collateral arrests and flash‑bangs—treated immigrant presence as presumptively suspect. Universities and students were squeezed as Harvard lost access to foreign student visas and pro‑Palestinian protesters faced detention and deportation threats. Independent media and public knowledge came under financial and procedural attack through efforts to defund NPR and PBS, muzzle VA researchers, and cut scientific and statistical capacity. At the same time, Palantir‑driven data centralization and Supreme Court orders granting DOGE access to Social Security records expanded surveillance while elite actors navigated with impunity. Courts, archives, and some agencies still offered pockets of resistance, but the Democracy Clock’s move from 10:46 to 10:50 p.m. captured a denser, more coherent regime of stratified citizenship, curated memory, and law as weapon.
