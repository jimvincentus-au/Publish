\f0\fs26 \cf0 In Week 38 of Trump\'92s second term, the Democracy Clock stayed at 7:59 p.m., but the machinery behind it tightened. A newly installed U.S. attorney, drawn from Trump\'92s personal legal circle, indicted New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey, turning federal criminal power against high-profile critics while corruption probes into allies quietly vanished. Simultaneously, the administration pressed to deploy National Guard units and even the 82nd Airborne into Democratic-led cities, framing immigration enforcement and protest policing as grounds for domestic military action. Federal judges in Chicago and Portland, joined by governors from both parties, carved out limits on deployments and protected journalists, even as ICE agents ignored restraints on the ground. A weaponized shutdown let the White House and House leadership starve disfavored programs, threaten federal workers\'92 back pay, and block a new member\'92s seating to avoid Epstein-file transparency. Foreign deals, vaccine misinformation, and pressure on academics and media rounded out a week where law and force were openly repurposed for presidential grievance.\
