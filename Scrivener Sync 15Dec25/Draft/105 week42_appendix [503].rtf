\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 42 Appendix: Hunger and Pardons as Power\
\
This week combines an extraordinary concentration of authoritarian moves from the federal executive with a surprisingly strong, though still outgunned, democratic counter-mobilization. On the decay side, the Trump administration openly defies court orders on SNAP, stretches war powers to cover lethal boat bombings, threatens or plans military deployments in Venezuela, Mexico, and domestically under the Insurrection Act, and issues sweeping pardons for 2020 election subversion figures and controversial allies. DOJ is visibly weaponized against enemies and protective of friends, while ICE and other enforcement arms escalate raids, family separations, and even contemplate private bounty hunters and a child-tracking call center. Regulatory and fiscal policy is heavily captured by donors and industry, from Extremity Care\'92s ballroom-linked windfall to FCC prison-call hikes and a massive ICE detention buildout. Simultaneously, voters and courts deliver notable pushback: Democrats win key governorships and commissions, Maine voters reject voter ID, Pennsylvania retains a pro-voting-rights supreme court, judges rebuke politicized prosecutions and SNAP defiance, and civil society plans mass protest. Structurally, however, the week\'92s net pressure tilts sharply toward entrenched executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and normalized crisis governance.\
\
Week 42 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. Department of Justice told Congress the War Powers Resolution did not apply to lethal boat bombings (2025-11-01): DOJ\'92s claim that airstrikes on boats are not \'93hostilities\'94 narrowed War Powers constraints, expanding the president\'92s ability to conduct lethal operations without timely congressional authorization or oversight.\
\
2. President Trump criticized Democrats over the shutdown and urged Republicans to abolish the Senate filibuster (2025-11-01): Trump\'92s push to end the filibuster in order to speed his agenda and blame Democrats for the shutdown signaled a willingness to weaken minority protections in Congress to consolidate partisan control.\
\
3. President Trump threatened military action against Nigeria over violence against Christians (2025-11-01): Threatening to invade Nigeria over religious persecution framed foreign policy in religious terms and suggested willingness to deploy U.S. force abroad without clear multilateral or congressional backing.\
\
4. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered all Pentagon communications with Congress to be routed through a central office (2025-11-01): Centralizing Pentagon contacts with Congress curtailed direct information flows from military officials to lawmakers, weakening independent legislative oversight of defense policy and operations.\
\
5. President Trump said he would consider using the Insurrection Act to deploy the military domestically beyond judicial review (2025-11-02): Trump\'92s assertion that he could deploy troops at home under the Insurrection Act without judicial check signaled readiness to use military force against domestic unrest with minimal legal constraint.\
\
6. President Trump ordered demolition of the White House East Wing to build a $300 million ballroom (2025-11-03): Replacing the East Wing, long used for first lady initiatives and public engagement, with an expensive ballroom redirected symbolic and physical space of the presidency toward personal spectacle over civic function.\
\
7. President Trump froze $100 million in federal funds for tribal climate relocation projects (2025-11-03): Freezing relocation funds for climate-threatened tribal communities undermined promised federal support to vulnerable populations, signaling selective use of executive control over appropriations.\
\
8. President Trump publicly vowed to defy a federal court order on SNAP benefits while his administration partially complied (2025-11-03): Trump\'92s declaration that he would ignore a court order on food aid, even as staff sent partial payments, eroded respect for judicial authority and used essential benefits as political leverage.\
\
9. President Trump refused to release full SNAP funds despite a court mandate, citing the need to keep the country \'93liquid\'94 (2025-11-06): By withholding court-ordered SNAP funds from over 41 million people, Trump used executive control over basic subsistence to pressure political opponents and test the enforceability of judicial rulings.\
\
10. President Trump demanded that the Senate abolish the filibuster to pass restrictive voting measures (2025-11-06): Trump\'92s call to scrap the filibuster specifically to enact voter ID and end mail voting tied structural Senate rule changes to an agenda of narrowing electoral access.\
\
11. President Trump oversaw the longest federal government shutdown while threatening mass firings and withholding back pay (2025-11-06): Sustaining a record shutdown and menacing unpaid federal workers with firings and delayed back pay used executive control over salaries and services as a coercive political tool.\
\
12. President Trump issued pardons to seven individuals including Michael McMahon, with initially identical signatures on clemency orders (2025-11-07): Issuing controversial pardons with apparently cloned signatures, later replaced, raised doubts about the authenticity and care of clemency decisions, weakening confidence in a key constitutional power.\
\
13. President Trump signed pardons for 77 individuals involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election (2025-11-07): Mass pardons for actors in the 2020 election subversion schemes removed federal accountability for attempts to overturn certified results, signaling impunity for future anti-democratic plots.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. President Trump pardoned Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao despite his money-laundering conviction and personal business ties (2025-11-02): The pardon of Zhao, whose firm had major dealings with Trump\'92s crypto venture, blurred lines between public justice and private financial interest, undermining equal application of the law.\
\
2. Department of Justice fired senior FBI aviation official Steven Palmer amid controversy over the director\'92s personal jet use (2025-11-01): Removing a veteran FBI official after scrutiny of the director\'92s personal jet travel suggested retaliation against internal accountability and weakened norms around stewardship of public resources.\
\
3. Department of Justice pressed politicized prosecutions of Trump adversaries while ending the Epstein co-conspirator inquiry (2025-11-04): DOJ\'92s pursuit of cases against figures like James Comey and Letitia James, alongside an abrupt halt to the Epstein co-conspirator probe, reflected selective enforcement that shielded elites while targeting critics.\
\
4. Federal judge in Comey case ordered DOJ to submit complete grand jury transcripts after finding earlier filings incomplete (2025-11-03): The judge\'92s demand for full grand jury records in the Comey prosecution signaled judicial pushback against opaque, potentially abusive charging practices within DOJ.\
\
5. Virginia magistrate judge Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials in the Comey case and criticized their approach (2025-11-05): By rebuking prosecutors for \'93indicting first and investigating later,\'94 the magistrate underscored judicial resistance to politicized prosecutions and defended due process norms.\
\
6. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes sued the U.S. House over Speaker Johnson\'92s delay in swearing in Adelita Grijalva (2025-11-05): The lawsuit argued that withholding the oath from a duly elected representative to block her participation in House business violated constitutional guarantees of representation.\
\
7.

\
13. U.S. Senate voted to nullify Trump\'92s reciprocal tariffs in a largely symbolic rebuke (2025-11-05): The Senate\'92s vote to overturn reciprocal tariffs asserted congressional authority over trade and taxation, even though House inaction limited its practical effect.\

\
15.

\
17. U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to enforce a passport sex-marker policy based on sex at birth (2025-11-06): By reinstating a policy limiting passport sex markers to birth sex, the Court\'92s conservative majority enabled executive restrictions on recognition of transgender and non-binary identities while litigation continues.\
\
18. U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump\'92s tariff policy and its consistency with congressional taxing powers (2025-11-06): Justices\'92 skepticism that IEEPA authorizes revenue-raising tariffs highlighted concerns about presidents using emergency statutes to bypass Congress\'92s constitutional control over taxation.\

Worthington approved a lenient youthful-offender plea deal for an 18-year-old convicted of multiple rapes (2025-11-07): Granting community-service-focused treatment in a serious sexual assault case fueled perceptions that the justice system can minimize accountability for certain offenders, undermining public trust.\

\
