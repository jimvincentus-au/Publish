Week 42: Hunger and Pardons as Power
A week of shutdown brinkmanship, militarized enforcement, and pay-to-play clemency showed law, welfare, and knowledge bent to serve executive will.
The forty-second week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single shock. It unfolded as a dense layering of choices that treated law, welfare, and knowledge as tools to be bent rather than limits to be honored. Across domains, the same pattern appeared: rules were read for advantage, institutions were steered toward loyalty, and those on the margins bore the cost. Resistance surfaced in courtrooms, in state policy, and in civil society, but it met a presidency more willing to ignore, delay, or route around constraint. That willingness grew more visible.  
At the close of the prior period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:11 p.m. It ended this week at the same public time, with an internal movement of a fraction of a minute. The face of the clock did not change, but the gears behind it did. The week’s actions deepened executive defiance of courts, widened the use of emergency and war powers, and fused public policy with private gain, even as judges ordered compliance and some voters chose more inclusive paths. The apparent stillness marks a balance of forces: accelerating erosion met by pockets of resistance strong enough to prevent a visible lurch, but not to reverse the direction of travel. The strain on the system increased even as the hands stayed put.  
The most immediate arena where power and law collided was the federal shutdown and the fight over food assistance. Early in the week, Trump announced that he would not comply with a federal court order requiring full November SNAP benefits during the shutdown. He framed the refusal as fiscal prudence and constitutional hardball, insisting that keeping the country “liquid” justified holding back food aid. Officials at the Department of Agriculture moved partial funds, but the president’s public stance made clear that, in his view, judicial rulings were suggestions to be weighed against political leverage, not commands to be obeyed. Hunger became a bargaining tool.  
Federal judges pushed back. In Rhode Island, Judge McConnell ordered the administration to pay full November SNAP benefits, criticizing earlier noncompliance and underscoring that statutory obligations to low-income households do not vanish in a budget standoff. Another district court reiterated that withholding food aid for political gain was unlawful. The administration responded not by conceding, but by appealing these rulings, turning the question of whether the executive can ration subsistence benefits into a prolonged legal contest. The courts asserted their authority; the White House treated their orders as one more bargaining chip. The rule of law was forced into a slow grind.  
Congress’s behavior reinforced the sense that basic welfare had become hostage to partisan strategy. Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic resolution to fully fund SNAP during the shutdown, and the chamber rejected a broader government funding package for the fourteenth time, prolonging the closure. Each failed vote kept agencies partially shuttered and left millions of families uncertain about their next month’s groceries. The legislature functioned as a stage for blame rather than a forum for resolution. In that vacuum, the president’s willingness to defy court orders carried more weight. The cost fell on those with the least cushion.  
The shutdown’s effects rippled through the country’s infrastructure. The Federal Aviation Administration warned that unpaid controllers were overworked and began planning to slow air traffic. By midweek, the agency announced a ten percent reduction in flight capacity, cutting thousands of daily flights to cope with staff shortages. What began as a political standoff in Washington translated into delayed travel, strained safety systems, and economic losses for airlines, workers, and passengers. At the same time, Trump threatened federal workers with firings and withheld back pay, using the payroll of a neutral civil service as another lever in the fight. Ordinary public servants became pressure points.  
Economic messaging tried to blunt the damage. Administration officials claimed that inflation and grocery prices were down, while blaming the shutdown for broader economic woes. The narrative minimized the role of policy choices—tax cuts tilted upward, tariffs that rattled manufacturers, and the deliberate use of SNAP as leverage—and cast the crisis as an unfortunate byproduct of necessary toughness. In North Carolina and elsewhere, defiance of SNAP orders was framed as a constitutional stand against Democrats, recasting legal noncompliance as patriotism. The people most affected—low-income households relying on food assistance—were reduced to instruments in a larger contest. Their hardship was treated as collateral.  
Beyond domestic welfare, the week saw a concerted effort to stretch the president’s freedom to use force. The Department of Justice issued a memo asserting that lethal airstrikes on boats did not count as “hostilities” under the War Powers Resolution. By redefining the term, the opinion allowed ongoing bombings to proceed without triggering the statute’s reporting and authorization requirements. The legal move did not create new weapons; it loosened the leash on existing ones, narrowing Congress’s ability to demand a say in when and where Americans fight. Words on paper shifted the reach of war.  
Trump’s rhetoric went further. He said he would consider using the Insurrection Act to deploy the Army or Marines against domestic unrest, and claimed that such deployments would be beyond judicial review. The suggestion that no judge could challenge internal troop use signaled a readiness to treat the military as a domestic police force under personal command. Abroad, he threatened military action against Nigeria over violence against Christians, ordered preparations, and floated possible operations inside Mexico against drug cartels. He speculated about war with Venezuela and predicted Nicolás Maduro’s downfall, keeping the option of intervention alive in public discourse. Force was presented as a first resort.  
Congress and the courts tried to mark boundaries, but their efforts were uneven. The Senate voted down a war powers resolution that would have required approval for strikes in Venezuela, leaving those operations with fewer legislative constraints. At the same time, senators passed a largely symbolic measure to nullify Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, asserting Congress’s constitutional role over taxation even as House inaction blunted its effect. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, testing whether presidents can effectively levy taxes through emergency authority. The very fact of review signaled judicial concern, but until rulings arrive, the executive continues to wield trade tools as quasi-war instruments. The emergency frame became a standing doorway.  
Inside the defense establishment, oversight channels narrowed. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that all Pentagon contacts with Congress be routed through a central office, placing political appointees between lawmakers and military professionals. What had been a web of direct relationships—commanders briefing committees, analysts answering technical questions—was pulled into a single, controlled funnel. At the same time, Trump urged Republicans to abolish the Senate filibuster in order to pass restrictive voting measures and speed his agenda, treating procedural guardrails as obstacles to be cleared when they hindered partisan goals. The combined effect was to sideline both branches that might check the presidency: Congress in its war powers and its internal rules, and the courts in their review of domestic force. The center of gravity moved further toward the Oval Office.  
Nowhere did the fusion of force and fear show more vividly than in immigration enforcement. On Halloween and during Día de los Muertos events in Chicago and Los Angeles, federal immigration agents, backed by troops and masked personnel, conducted raids that looked less like routine policing and more like military operations. Pepper spray and arrests spilled into community celebrations. In Chicago, agents stormed spaces where families had gathered, and in Los Angeles they moved through public areas with a show of overwhelming power. The timing and tactics sent a clear message: even ordinary civic life in immigrant neighborhoods could be disrupted at will. No gathering felt safe.  
Individual cases revealed the human cost behind the spectacle. ICE deported Randall Alberto Gamboa Esquivel while he was in a vegetative state after months in detention; he later died abroad. In Chicago, agents arrested a daycare worker inside a childcare center, allegedly using excessive force in front of children. In Los Angeles, they arrested a U.S. citizen father in a parking lot raid and drove off with his toddler, leaving bystanders stunned. These were not isolated missteps; they were part of a pattern in which aggressive enforcement disregarded due process, family integrity, and community trauma. The law’s sharp edge fell on the least protected.  
The machinery behind these actions grew more complex and less accountable. ICE considered hiring private bounty hunters to track immigrants, proposing to pay profit-driven contractors to locate people for enforcement. The agency also announced a 24/7 call center in Nashville to help law enforcement locate unaccompanied migrant children using data tools, expanding surveillance over one of the most vulnerable populations in the system. Congress, for its part, passed legislation allocating $45 billion to expand ICE detention centers, including facilities for children. The funding entrenched a detention-centered approach to migration, with new beds and buildings that will outlast any single policy debate. Concrete and contracts locked in a set of choices.  
State-level decisions reinforced the stratification. The Texas Department of Public Safety suspended issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to non-citizens, including DACA recipients, cutting off lawful work opportunities in a core economic sector. A massive ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia detained and deported more than 300 South Korean workers, disrupting a major manufacturing project and rattling foreign investors. Together, these moves signaled that immigration status and national origin could determine not only one’s exposure to raids and detention, but also one’s access to basic economic participation. Work itself became contingent on status.  
Beyond immigration, the week’s decisions deepened a hierarchy of citizenship and rights. The Supreme Court allowed the administration to enforce a passport policy that limits sex markers to sex at birth, barring transgender and non-binary people from accurate identification on federal documents. The conservative majority’s order reinstated a rule that affects travel, safety, and recognition for those communities. At the same time, the Court considered whether to hear Davis v. Ermold, a case that could reopen questions about nationwide same-sex marriage rights. Even the possibility of revisiting settled precedent unsettled LGBTQ+ protections and signaled that established rights were once again contingent. Security of status became provisional.  
Domestic social policy moved in a similar direction. In Utah, state officials advanced plans for a large facility to involuntarily confine unhoused individuals under a rehabilitation model. The shift from housing-first approaches to locked “campuses” reframed homelessness as a moral failing to be corrected through confinement rather than a condition to be addressed with housing and services. The policy risked criminalizing poverty and weakening the rights of unhoused people to move and assemble. Meanwhile, Trump froze $100 million in federal funds for tribal climate relocation projects, halting promised support for communities facing rising seas and environmental displacement. The decision used executive control over appropriations to stall aid for some of the country’s most vulnerable residents. Vulnerability met delay, not relief.  
Other institutions made choices that amplified inequality. The Federal Communications Commission voted to increase allowable rates for prison phone and video calls, shifting more costs onto incarcerated people and their families, even as it reinstated a ban on kickbacks in prison phone contracts. An Oklahoma judge approved a youthful offender plea deal with minimal punishment for an eighteen-year-old convicted of multiple rapes, raising questions about whose crimes receive leniency. Against this backdrop, Colorado voters approved a tax increase on high earners to fund universal school meals and raises for cafeteria workers, offering a contrasting model in which fiscal tools are used to broaden, rather than narrow, basic security. The contrast showed that other paths remained open.  
If the social order was being stratified, the economic order was being rewritten to favor those closest to power. The administration and Congress enacted a major tax cut bill that heavily benefited wealthy individuals and corporations, shifting fiscal gains upward and constraining resources for public programs. At the same time, the White House ordered demolition of the East Wing to build a $300 million ballroom, replacing traditional public-service functions with a space devoted to presidential prestige. The physical seat of government itself became a canvas for personal glorification. Public architecture was bent toward one man’s image.  
The ballroom project was not merely symbolic. Extremity Care, a health-care firm selling high-priced skin substitutes, secretly donated $2.5 million toward the construction, routing the money anonymously while benefiting from a delayed Medicare rule that would have barred coverage of its products. The administration postponed the cost-control rule and later proposed a payment cap that still allowed coverage of unproven, expensive treatments. The company’s CEO attended an exclusive donor dinner with Trump amid these favorable decisions. The sequence—regulatory delay, secret donation, high-level access—illustrated how policy could be shaped by those able to buy proximity to power. Pay-to-play moved from suspicion to pattern.  
Regulatory capture appeared in other sectors as well. The FCC’s decision to raise prison phone rate caps favored telecom providers over incarcerated families. NASA’s administrator, Jared Isaacman, was reappointed after pressure from Elon Musk, highlighting how major scientific appointments could be driven by private influence rather than independent vetting. The Federal Reserve injected $125 billion in short-term liquidity into the banking system to stabilize funding markets during economic stress, socializing risk while profits remained private. Tariff policies hurt manufacturers like Toyota and Stellantis, contributing to layoffs and economic anxiety in rural communities, even as the administration maintained export controls on advanced chips to China and escalated a trade war that cut soybean exports and prompted rare-earth restrictions. The gains and losses tracked lines of power.  
Within this economic landscape, wealth did not just buy access; it bought law. Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao after his money-laundering conviction, despite the firm’s business ties to his family. He later admitted that he had granted clemency without fully understanding who Zhao was, underscoring the arbitrary and self-interested use of the pardon power in high-stakes financial cases. The president also pardoned Michael McMahon, a former police officer convicted of acting as an agent for China in an intimidation plot, and approved a lenient plea in a serious rape case. These decisions fit alongside the tax cuts and regulatory favors as part of a broader pattern in which elite financial and political crimes avoided real sanction. Accountability bent around wealth and connection.  
The week’s most sweeping act of impunity came with mass pardons for seventy-seven individuals involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Issued while shutdown fights, tariff litigation, and immigration raids dominated headlines, the clemency orders removed federal accountability for key figures in a democratic subversion scheme. A technical glitch briefly posted seven pardons online with nearly identical signatures, later replaced, raising questions about whether clemency had been reduced to an administrative bulk process rather than a case-by-case constitutional act. The timing and manner of the pardons suggested both confidence and carelessness: confidence that such acts would stand, and carelessness about the appearance of individualized justice. The signal to future plotters was unmistakable.  
At the same time, the Justice Department’s choices and congressional maneuvers worked to bury elite wrongdoing. Representative Jamie Raskin accused DOJ of a “gigantic cover-up” in abruptly ending the Epstein co-conspirator inquiry, highlighting concerns that abuse cases involving powerful figures were being shielded from full investigation. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson delayed swearing in Adelita Grijalva for more than six weeks after her special election win, preventing her from voting and from signing a discharge petition that would have forced release of Epstein-related records. Arizona’s attorney general sued the House over the delay, arguing that withholding the oath violated constitutional representation. The combined effect of the investigation’s closure and the procedural obstruction was to keep sensitive files out of public and congressional view. Memory itself was managed from above.  
Courts showed flashes of skepticism toward politicized prosecutions, but within a system already tilted. In the case against former FBI director James Comey, a magistrate judge ordered prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials and later demanded complete transcripts after an incomplete submission. The rulings signaled judicial concern that the indictment might reflect retaliatory use of the Justice Department. Yet even as some judges pressed for transparency, DOJ launched an investigation into California’s redistricting referendum while Trump labeled it a “GIANT SCAM,” casting doubt on a voter-approved measure and feeding disinformation about fraud. House Republicans explored using the Fourteenth Amendment’s insurrection clause to block Zohran Mamdani from taking office as New York City mayor, signaling a willingness to label opponents as illegitimate rather than accept electoral outcomes. Law became a weapon more than a limit.  
Media and oversight figures operated under pressure in this environment. CBS paid Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over editing his 60 Minutes interview while the network sought approval for a merger, suggesting that major outlets might temper editorial decisions to avoid political retaliation and secure business deals. Within the FBI, Director Kash Patel forced out senior aviation official Steven Palmer after scrutiny of the director’s personal jet use, a move that looked like retaliation against internal oversight. These actions reinforced a climate in which watchdogs and independent voices—whether inside agencies or in the press—faced financial and professional risks for crossing those in power. The cost of speaking up rose.  
The administration also moved to reshape knowledge institutions and civic narratives. Cornell University reached a settlement restoring federal funds in exchange for sharing data and adopting the administration’s civil-rights interpretations, including campus climate evaluations under federal terms. The White House proposed a broader “compact” offering universities preferential funding if they advanced a conservative agenda and rolled back diversity initiatives. Together, these measures tied research money and institutional stability to ideological conformity, pressuring higher education to align with the ruling bloc’s cultural and legal priorities. The classroom became another front.  
Information management extended beyond campuses. Economic officials and spokespeople selectively framed data, claiming improvements in inflation and prices while downplaying the administration’s role in economic strain. The SNAP defiance in North Carolina was cast as constitutional principle rather than lawbreaking. The FBI planned an open advisory meeting on national crime information systems, even as ICE built a data-driven call center to track unaccompanied minors. These developments showed how data systems could be used both to manage populations and to shape perceptions, depending on who controlled the definitions and the flow. Numbers became tools of narrative as well as policy.  
Religion and security narratives were woven into this fabric. Trump’s threat to invade Nigeria to protect Christians abroad invoked faith as a rationale for force, blending foreign policy with sectarian appeals that could marginalize other groups. At home, FBI Director Patel publicized an alleged Halloween terror plot by young gamers, a claim that defense lawyers disputed. The episode raised concerns that ordinary behavior could be exaggerated into extremism, justifying broader surveillance and enforcement. In each case, identity—religious, sexual, national—became a lens through which the state claimed the right to act more aggressively. Categories of belonging shaped exposure to power.  
Amid these pressures, some institutional routines continued. The Census Bureau sought approval to maintain the Current Population Survey’s demographic data collection. The Environmental Protection Agency issued rules on chemical uses and pesticide residues. The Food and Drug Administration scheduled an advisory committee meeting on a heart device. Senate committees held hearings on veterans’ disability benefits reporting. These actions preserved parts of the administrative state’s normal work, but they unfolded alongside, and often beneath, the more consequential shifts in how power was used and who it served. Normalcy persisted in pockets.  
Looking ahead from this week, several processes were already in motion. The Supreme Court’s pending decisions on emergency-based tariffs and its consideration of a same-sex marriage case would determine how far executive authority and civil rights could be stretched. Appeals over SNAP funding would test whether courts could enforce welfare obligations against a defiant White House. The new ICE detention funding and the Utah homelessness facility plans would move from authorization to construction, hardening physical infrastructures of confinement. University compacts and settlements would begin to filter into curricula and campus policies. The choices of this week will echo in brick, paper, and code.  
In the arc of Trump’s second term, this week marked a deepening of patterns rather than their birth. Executive defiance of courts, the use of war and emergency powers as routine tools, the fusion of public office with private enrichment, and the stratification of citizenship all advanced another step. At the same time, judges ordered compliance, state voters chose redistributive policies, and civil society actors sued to enforce representation and expose cover-ups. The net effect was not stasis but tension: democratic circuits still fired, yet they did so in a system increasingly organized to absorb, delay, or punish their signals. The moral floor sagged further, even as parts of the structure tried to hold.
