Painterly, realistic style, muted colors, atmosphere of creeping unease."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 9 of Trump\u2019s second term traced how emergency logic and personal grievance seeped into ordinary governance. The Democracy Clock moved from 7:52 p.m. to 7:56 p.m., a 3.3\u2011minute erosion, as the administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants, continued flights in defiance of Judge James Boasberg\u2019s orders, and turned images of shackled deportees and El Salvador\u2019s prisons into propaganda. Courts pushed back, blocking some deportations, halting the dismantling of USAID, and limiting DOGE\u2019s access to Social Security data, even as Trump demanded Boasberg\u2019s impeachment and allies filed articles against him. Simultaneously, executive orders moved to dismantle the Department of Education, shift student loans to the SBA, and freeze hundreds of millions in university funding tied to protests and trans inclusion. DOGE consolidated data and procurement power while agencies like the IRS, FTC, NNSA, and USDA were hollowed out. Independent media and public history were pared back, with USAGM/VOA shuttered and disability and gun\u2011violence guidance removed, as Elon Musk\u2019s firms gained privileged access to contracts and infrastructure.",
