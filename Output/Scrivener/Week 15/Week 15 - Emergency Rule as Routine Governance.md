Week 15: Emergency Rule as Routine Governance
In Trump’s fifteenth week back in office, emergencies, executive orders, and data systems quietly rewired law, citizenship, and information into tools of regime protection.
The fifteenth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single shock. It unfolded as a dense, coordinated use of tools that already existed: emergency declarations, executive orders, budget frameworks, and internal directives. Each move could be defended as lawful, even routine. Taken together, they described a government learning how to rule by exception as a matter of course, and how to turn the machinery of the state toward its own protection.
At the close of Week 14 the Democracy Clock stood at 7:57 p.m. By the end of Week 15 it read 7:59 p.m., a net movement of 1.9 minutes. The shift reflected no coup, no suspended election, no single rupture. It registered instead the normalization of emergency rule, the redirection of law enforcement toward friends and foes, the starving of independent media, and the steady construction of a tiered social order. Courts and civil society pushed back at the edges, but the week’s balance of power moved further toward an executive that acted first and left others to react.
The clearest signal of that consolidation came in the form of paired national emergencies. Trump declared crises at the southern border and in energy production, using them to expand immigration enforcement and fossil‑fuel drilling without waiting for Congress. The border emergency wrapped deportation and detention in the language of national security. The “energy emergency” did the same for drilling, coal extensions, and deep‑sea mining. Both turned what had been extraordinary powers into policy levers, available whenever the White House wished to move fast and alone.
Those declarations were not isolated. They sat atop a broader redesign of the state’s internal wiring. The president reclassified large numbers of federal employees into a Schedule F‑style category, easing their removal and making career roles more like political appointments. Job protections that once insulated analysts, lawyers, and program managers from partisan swings were thinned. Neutral administration became more contingent on loyalty. At the same time, independent regulators—agencies like the SEC and FTC—were ordered to submit their policy priorities to the White House for approval. Independence that had been built over decades was pulled back under direct presidential oversight.
Into that newly centralized structure the administration inserted a novel organ: Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE was expanded to oversee contracts, grants, loans, and payment systems across the government. Its staff embedded at FAA and HUD under nondisclosure agreements, rewriting communications and regulatory processes with the help of AI tools. What had been public functions—procurement, rule drafting, benefit delivery—were now filtered through a quasi‑private efficiency office aligned with the president, operating with less transparency than traditional departments.
The same pattern appeared in the treatment of whole departments and fiscal levers. Trump issued orders to dismantle the Department of Education, shifting its functions and signaling that a cabinet‑level guarantor of federal education policy could be undone by executive pen. Another order shifted more disaster relief costs onto states, with the clear implication that aid could be conditioned on policy compliance. Emergencies and appropriations, once shared domains, became instruments of discipline. States that resisted on immigration, climate, or social policy faced the prospect of bearing more of the burden when storms or fires came.
Congress did not disappear in this week, but its role narrowed. Republican leaders advanced a budget framework that allowed deep cuts to social spending to move with limited bipartisan deliberation, aligning the legislature’s fiscal posture with the executive’s agenda. House Republicans changed rules to block resolutions of inquiry into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of encrypted messaging, closing off a traditional oversight path. In the Senate, Republican leaders refused to curb unilateral tariff powers, leaving emergency trade authority largely intact. There were gestures of resistance—articles of impeachment filed by a Democratic representative, a tariff‑repeal bill from a libertarian Republican, marathon floor speeches warning of authoritarian drift—but these were symbolic. The structural changes in budget process, trade authority, and oversight rules remained.
Inside the bureaucracy, the same story played out in staffing and scope. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division lost roughly 70 percent of its attorneys after leadership changes and reprioritization. Senior managers in the voting section were removed, and active voting‑rights cases were dismissed. At the National Park Service, a reduction in force prepared to eliminate about 1,500 positions, shrinking capacity for conservation and public access. The Agriculture Department withdrew a salmonella safety rule for poultry after industry lobbying. On paper, agencies continued to issue technical rules and collect data. In practice, their ability to enforce civil‑rights, environmental, and public‑health protections was being hollowed out.
If the first development of the week was about who decides, the second was about who belongs. Immigration and citizenship policy hardened into something closer to an ethnonational, quasi‑militarized regime. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act—an 18th‑century wartime statute—to detain and deport migrants from Venezuela and other countries as alleged security threats. Deportations were routed through opaque arrangements with third countries like El Salvador, where some deportees disappeared or were imprisoned. Plans advanced to build a large migrant detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, placing tens of thousands of people offshore, far from ordinary courts and oversight.
On the ground, the border itself took on a military cast. A buffer zone along the U.S.–Mexico line was treated as a militarized strip, and migrants who crossed it were prosecuted. Civilian law enforcement blurred into military posture. At the same time, ICE used welfare and sponsorship data to target unaccompanied children and their sponsors, turning child‑protection systems into enforcement pipelines. Legal residents and green‑card holders with old convictions found themselves detained and slated for removal. Families were separated with little notice, including those with medically fragile children. The message was that status could be revoked and presence rendered precarious.
Alongside these enforcement practices, the legal architecture of citizenship itself was reworked. Trump signed executive orders attempting to end or limit birthright citizenship for children of certain non‑citizens, challenging a century‑old understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. The refugee resettlement program was frozen, with admissions limited to case‑by‑case “national interest” exceptions. A broad directive ended unspecified federal benefits for undocumented immigrants, threatening access to essential services. English was declared the official language of the United States, and language rules for commercial drivers were tightened, raising barriers for non‑English speakers to work and interact with the state.
These moves did not go unchallenged. Federal courts issued rulings blocking or limiting deportations of Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, holding that the law could not be stretched to peacetime mass removals. Judges protected specific individuals, like Javier Salazar and Mohsen Mahdawi, on due‑process and free‑speech grounds. Appellate courts upheld injunctions limiting DOGE’s access to Social Security records, constraining the administration’s data‑mining ambitions. Yet as these decisions came down, Trump publicly attacked “radical‑left judges,” called for Supreme Court intervention, and allies in Congress went so far as to call for the arrest of judges. The clash between an expansive executive and a wary judiciary sharpened, even as enforcement on the ground continued.
A third strand of the week’s story ran through the Justice Department and the president’s use of clemency. Trump ordered DOJ to investigate ActBlue, a major Democratic fundraising platform, and law firms tied to his critics. Federal law enforcement, which is supposed to operate at arm’s length from partisan politics, was directed toward a rival’s infrastructure and disfavored attorneys. At the same time, the administration paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and closed DOJ’s cryptocurrency unit. Anti‑bribery prosecutions and crypto‑crime investigations were put on hold, reducing legal risk for multinational firms and digital‑asset players, many of them donors or allies.
Clemency power was used in parallel. The president issued pardons and commutations that erased over a billion dollars in fines and restitution owed by white‑collar offenders and a cryptocurrency exchange. He also pardoned January 6 defendants and ordered related prosecutions dropped. Those who had attacked the Capitol on his behalf, and those who had committed major financial crimes, saw their legal burdens lifted. The pattern was stark: law came down hard on perceived enemies and protesters, while it bent or vanished for those close to power.
Inside DOJ, this posture was institutionalized. A “weaponization working group” was created to frame investigations of Trump as political persecution, recasting oversight as illegitimate. The department dropped investigations and lawsuits against 89 corporations, many of them donors, and intervened in court to block state climate lawsuits against oil companies in Michigan and Hawaii. Puerto Rico, watching these moves, voluntarily dismissed its own climate suit. Civil‑rights and voting‑rights enforcement was gutted by staff losses and case dismissals. At the same time, protections for journalists were rolled back: policies shielding reporters from subpoenas were rescinded, and the prospect of jailing those who refused to reveal sources returned. In a televised interview, Trump misrepresented photoshopped tattoo evidence to justify a deportation, insisting on a false gang affiliation even when challenged. Law, in this configuration, was less a limit than a weapon.
Economic policy in Week 15 fused trade shocks, climate rollback, and personal enrichment into a single field of action. The administration imposed sweeping tariffs, including a 145 percent duty on Chinese goods and broad reciprocal tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, often justified on vague security grounds. The de minimis loophole for low‑value imports was closed, hitting small importers and Chinese exporters. Auto tariffs were adjusted on the fly to relieve some domestic firms. High tariffs were slapped on solar panels from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia, raising costs for clean‑energy projects. At the same time, Amazon was pressured not to display tariff impacts on prices, muting consumer awareness of policy‑driven cost increases.
The economic fallout was visible. Reciprocal tariffs and sector‑specific duties contributed to manufacturing decline and tourism losses. UPS announced layoffs of about 20,000 workers and the closure of 73 facilities, citing tariff‑related volume declines. Initial unemployment claims rose to their highest level in months. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.3 percent GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2025, the first in three years. Trump, in a televised cabinet meeting, blamed his predecessor for the downturn. The structure of risk was clear. Policy shocks were chosen at the top, while workers and small businesses bore the brunt.
On climate and energy, the administration moved in the opposite direction of global trends. Fossil‑fuel extraction was expanded through fast‑tracked permits, coal‑plant extensions, deep‑sea mining, and the energy emergency. Renewable energy permitting on federal lands and waters was halted, and tariffs on imported solar panels compounded the blow. Environmental justice initiatives and offices were closed, ending programs that had targeted pollution in marginalized communities. The United States withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, the UN climate loss‑and‑damage fund, the World Health Organization, and the UN Human Rights Council, cutting support for global public goods and weakening cooperative responses to climate and health crises.
These policy choices intersected with more overt forms of crony capitalism. The $TRUMP cryptocurrency contest and the Executive Branch club offered access to the president and senior officials in exchange for token purchases and membership fees. Trump family members invested in an AI company shortly before deregulation benefiting the sector, raising conflict‑of‑interest concerns. The administration dropped investigations into 89 corporations, many of which had donated to Trump’s inaugural fund. A sovereign wealth fund and a strategic bitcoin reserve were announced, concentrating control over large pools of public capital in the executive branch. Work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP advanced, while the federal minimum wage remained untouched and a proposal to end taxation on tips dangled relief that would miss many low‑income workers. A farmer bailout was prepared to offset tariff damage, socializing some costs while preserving the trade course. In each case, profits and protection clustered upward; risk and austerity flowed down.
Civil‑rights infrastructure, already strained by these economic and enforcement choices, was further dismantled. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across federal agencies were ended, and similar rollbacks were encouraged in the private sector. Environmental justice offices were closed. The Pentagon’s Women, Peace and Security program was terminated, reducing women’s participation in security decision‑making. Refugee protections were narrowed, with consideration given to allowing only Christian Afghan refugees to remain after broader safeguards were revoked. Funding for UNRWA and the UN Human Rights Council was cut, weakening international mechanisms that support vulnerable populations.
Domestically, specific groups were singled out. Federal funding and insurance coverage for gender‑affirming care were restricted, and gender transitions for minors were banned. A federal report urged therapy over medical treatment for youth with gender dysphoria, contradicting major medical associations and providing a rationale for state‑level restrictions. Transgender athletes were banned from women’s sports, with some federal funds tied to compliance. LGBTQ Pride events at the Kennedy Center were canceled. The Education Department opened investigations into race‑conscious programs like Chicago’s Black Student Success Plan and Harvard Law Review’s editorial practices, signaling skepticism toward targeted equity efforts. In Maine, a politically charged freeze on child‑nutrition funds over transgender athlete policies ended in a settlement that restored money but underscored how essential programs could be used as leverage.
Courts again provided partial counterweights. Federal judges limited deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and upheld injunctions against DOGE’s access to Social Security records. Democratic state attorneys general mounted coordinated challenges to Trump’s early executive orders. Yet these legal victories were reactive and narrow. The broader pattern—of dismantled DEI and environmental justice structures, selective enforcement, and international withdrawal—remained intact, building a durable framework for a stratified social order.
Religion and nationalist symbolism moved closer to the center of governance. The president created a Religious Liberty Commission and strengthened the White House Faith Office’s policy role. At a National Prayer Day event, he framed national renewal as a return to religion in public life, tying the fortunes of the state to a particular faith narrative. In Oklahoma, education authorities adopted a curriculum that dramatically increased references to Christianity while omitting the separation of church and state. Social studies standards embedded debunked 2020 election fraud claims, requiring students to analyze conspiracies as if they were legitimate civic content.
Symbolic control extended beyond classrooms. Trump ordered the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and Mount Denali to new, politically resonant titles, asserting executive power over geographic memory. The administration removed Doug Emhoff and other Biden‑era appointees from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum board, reshaping the leadership of a key institution of historical memory. Selective declassification of MLK and JFK assassination files increased transparency on one front while leaving motives and framing in the hands of the current administration. Together, these moves curated which histories were amplified and which were sidelined, aligning national storylines with the regime’s self‑image.
Information control tightened in more direct ways as well. Trump launched White House Wire, a state‑hosted site that aggregated exclusively positive coverage of his administration, blurring the line between official communication and propaganda. An executive order ended federal funding for NPR and PBS through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, threatening the financial base of non‑commercial news and educational programming, especially in rural and underserved areas. The FCC, under Trump‑appointed leadership, opened investigations into NPR and PBS that could justify further defunding. At the same time, the administration hosted alternative press briefings featuring right‑wing influencers who echoed its narratives, elevating loyalist voices in place of traditional reporters.
The cost of critical journalism rose. DOJ rescinded policies protecting reporters from subpoenas, reopening the possibility of jailing those who refused to reveal sources. Trump publicly attacked individual journalists as biased and untalented. The White House Correspondents’ Association withdrew comedian Amber Ruffin’s invitation to its annual dinner after sharp criticism of the administration, a small but telling accommodation. AI tools were used to help draft executive orders, including justifications for major tariff policies, making the language of law more opaque and harder to trace to human authors. Climate‑science agencies lost contributors, and the United States missed greenhouse‑gas reporting deadlines after withdrawing from international frameworks. Health policy was reshaped by a vaccine‑skeptical Health and Human Services secretary who altered testing and surveillance and delayed approval of a new Covid‑19 vaccine. The scaffolding that allows the public to understand risk and hold power to account weakened.
Education and protest spaces became contested ground. The administration threatened or froze funding to universities over alleged antisemitism and diversity policies, using federal dollars as leverage against campus speech and governance. The FBI raided the homes of pro‑Palestinian students in Michigan, seizing electronics in a vandalism investigation that risked chilling political expression. Yale revoked recognition of a student group that had organized a protest against an Israeli minister. Swarthmore suspended students involved in a pro‑Palestinian encampment without full conduct procedures. The Education Department’s investigations into race‑conscious programs added another layer of pressure.
At the state level, Oklahoma’s curriculum process was captured by ideological actors. The legislature failed to vote on a resolution that would have sent controversial social studies standards back for review. The curriculum committee was stacked with right‑wing activists rather than educators. Last‑minute changes and misleading deadlines were used to push the standards through the state board. Debunked election claims and Christian‑nationalist themes entered public education not by open debate, but by procedural maneuver. At the federal level, Trump’s order to dismantle the Department of Education threatened to remove a national counterweight to such state‑level experiments.
Yet civic space was not entirely closed. Harvard University refused administration demands to alter governance and admissions in exchange for funding, defending institutional autonomy. Illinois’s governor called for and led mass protests against Trump policies affecting marginalized communities. Democratic leaders staged a 12‑hour sit‑in at the U.S. Capitol to protest budget cuts to social programs. Senate Democrats used marathon floor speeches to warn of authoritarian tendencies. These acts did not reverse policy, but they signaled that resistance persisted in legislatures, campuses, and streets.
Behind the visible fights over tariffs, refugees, and public media, a quieter transformation unfolded in how law and surveillance operate. AI systems were used to draft executive orders and to rewrite regulations at HUD under DOGE’s guidance. DOGE staff embedded in agencies, operating under nondisclosure agreements, reshaped processes that determine who gets contracts, how rules are interpreted, and how benefits flow. The administration sought emergency Supreme Court approval for DOGE to access Social Security records, aiming to mine nationwide benefits data in the name of efficiency. Federal courts blocked that access, at least temporarily, underscoring the stakes of mass data‑mining by a politicized efficiency office.
These domestic moves sat within a global context in which data and synthetic media were already being used to distort politics. Reports from abroad described deepfake videos deployed in election campaigns and state surveillance data stolen and resold by officials. At home, the rollback of reporter protections and the expansion of citizen surveillance, combined with impunity for elite financial crimes, pointed toward a system in which ordinary people were more exposed while those at the top became more opaque. Algorithms and databases, rather than statutes alone, increasingly shaped who was seen, who was targeted, and who could contest decisions.
No single event in Week 15 closed a door that had been open the week before. Rights remained on the books. Courts continued to issue injunctions. Agencies still published rules and collected comments. But the week deepened a pattern in which emergency powers became routine tools, law enforcement served regime interests, economic shocks were used to reward insiders, and the information and education systems that might have checked these trends were brought under pressure. The movement of the Democracy Clock captured that accumulation: a small numerical shift that marked a larger change in what institutions could reliably guarantee, and in how much effort it now took for citizens, judges, and civil servants to stand in the way.
