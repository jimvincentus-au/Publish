  "weekly_audit": {
    "summary": "This week marked a continuation of the erosion of democratic norms, particularly in character, ethics, and restraint. The president's use of pardons and executive actions to shield allies from accountability and the targeting of specific communities based on nationality further deepened the existing trends of authoritarianism. While some institutional pushback was evident, it was insufficient to counter the overarching pattern of consolidation of power and disregard for democratic principles.",

    "narrative": "The moral floor continues to deteriorate, with the executive branch increasingly treating public institutions as extensions of personal power. This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the static position of the Democracy Clock at 8:11 p.m.",
