Week 17 of Trump’s second term shows not a single rupture but a tightening web. The Democracy Clock moves from 10:34 p.m. to 10:40 p.m., a 5.7‑minute slide driven by the fusion of foreign money, domestic law, and information control. The Qatar jet deal, Saudi investment-for-arms packages, and Trump-branded projects abroad make foreign autocrats business partners in U.S. policy. At home, the Justice Department’s new “name and shame” policy, threats to suspend habeas corpus, and investigations of past Trump prosecutors turn law into a weapon. Security forces are redirected toward immigration crackdowns and protest policing, while citizenship is stratified by race, ideology, and usefulness. Independent media and universities face funding cuts, surveillance, and purges as the White House launches its own propaganda channel. Courts still carve out islands of due process and speech, and local elections and civic voices push back, but the Civic Covenant is now partially cracked and the system of crony governance more coherent.
