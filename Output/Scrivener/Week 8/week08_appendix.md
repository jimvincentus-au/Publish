# Week 8 Appendix: Citizenship as Sorting Mechanism

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and a sharp turn toward exclusionary citizenship and weaponized law. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus drive mass firings, lease terminations, and deep cuts to education, science, health, and foreign aid, while courts begin to push back—ordering reinstatement of tens of thousands of workers and forcing transparency from DOGE and EPA. Immigration powers are overtly used against political speech, with Mahmoud Khalil’s detention becoming a central test of whether dissent by non‑citizens is tolerated at all. Simultaneously, the administration seeks to end birthright citizenship and normalize emergency authorities, structurally stratifying legal status. Internationally, the US abandons climate leadership, undermines Ukraine and NATO, and escalates trade wars, eroding alliances and global democratic norms. Information control intensifies through record destruction orders, meeting cancellations, and manipulation of DOGE data, even as independent outlets and courts expose discrepancies. Civil society mobilizes—science marches, anti‑oligarchy tours, Tesla protests, and Trump Tower sit‑ins—but faces criminalization and surveillance. Overall, the week exerts strong negative pressure on at least half the core safeguards of liberal democracy, with only modest countervailing judicial and civic resistance.
