Week 15 of Trump’s second term was not marked by a single rupture but by the consolidation of a new normal. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:57 to 7:59 p.m., a 1.9‑minute shift that captured how emergency rule, executive fiat, and data‑driven administration became routine instruments of power. Paired national emergencies on the border and energy, Schedule F‑style purges, and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency pulled independent agencies and civil servants under direct White House control. Immigration and citizenship policy hardened into an ethnonational, quasi‑militarized regime, even as courts issued narrow injunctions and were attacked for doing so. At the Justice Department, prosecutions were redirected toward enemies while pardons and non‑enforcement shielded donors and January 6 offenders. Tariffs, fossil‑fuel expansion, and pay‑to‑play schemes shifted economic risk downward and profit upward. Simultaneously, public media, universities, and curricula were pressured or remade, and AI‑mediated rulemaking and mass data‑mining bids hinted at a quieter transformation of law and surveillance.
