<h1>Week 19 Appendix: Institutions as Instruments of Loyalty</h1>
<p><em>A week of near-static clock time but deepening campaigns to bend immigration, universities, media, and law itself toward executive preference and profit.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an executive-centered project maturing into a system-wide challenge to liberal democracy. Trump’s record pace of executive orders, floated suspension of habeas corpus, and aggressive use of clemency for corrupt allies deepen the sense that law is a weapon, not a limit. Immigration becomes the primary testing ground: daily arrest quotas, the planned Office of Remigration, visa freezes, and Supreme Court green lights for ending parole and TPS collectively stratify legal status by origin and ideology. Simultaneously, universities and public media are targeted as rival centers of authority—Harvard is financially punished and surveilled, NPR and PBS defunded, while courts temporarily shield some of these institutions. Trade and foreign policy are bent toward personal and crony gain, with Vietnam’s Trump projects and Boeing’s treatment emblematic. Yet the judiciary, state attorneys general, universities, parents, and mass protest movements mount significant resistance, blocking some orders and exposing overreach. Structurally, the week intensifies pressures on executive dominance, civil service politicization, information control, and citizenship stratification, while also revealing that courts and civil society remain active, if embattled, counterweights.</p>
