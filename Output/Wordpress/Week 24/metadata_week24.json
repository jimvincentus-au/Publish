No recognizable politicians or text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 24 of Trump\u2019s second term was less a rupture than a soldering job. The One Big Beautiful Bill moved from slogan to statute, permanently extending the 2017 tax cuts, carving new breaks for capital, and slashing Medicaid, SNAP, Medicare, school funding, and Planned Parenthood. The same package poured unprecedented sums into defense, ICE, detention infrastructure, and prison phone profiteering, normalizing a security-heavy state that redistributes risk downward and wealth upward. Congress functioned largely as a transmission belt, bypassing the parliamentarian and GAO, stretching reconciliation rules, and muscling a 51\u201350 Senate vote into law despite broad opposition. The Supreme Court granted presidents absolute criminal immunity for official acts, narrowed nationwide injunctions, and allowed partial enforcement of a birthright-citizenship order, fragmenting core rights. Immigration and citizenship became flexible tools of repression, from Alligator Alcatraz to denaturalization drives and data-sharing of Medicaid records. Information systems, universities, and public health agencies were bent toward ideological control. The Democracy Clock inched from 8:01 to 8:02 p.m., capturing deepening erosion without open collapse.",
