Title
-----
Diagnostics of a Failing Republic

Subtitle
--------
A field guide to sixty recurring traits that show how self-government erodes from within long before the word democracy disappears.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
Before democracies fall, they fray. These sixty traits chart the quiet, repeatable ways a republic’s promises are converted into instruments of control.

Synopses
--------
Long Synopsis:
This chapter steps back from any single week’s headlines to map the recurring patterns by which democracies decay. It introduces sixty traits, grouped into five categories—Power and Authority; Institutions and Governance; Economic Structure; Civil Rights and Dissent; and Information, Memory, and Manipulation—that together describe how self-government is hollowed out from within. Each trait is defined as a diagnostic, not a prophecy: executives ruling without oversight, courts captured by donors, economies redesigned for extraction, dissent criminalized, and public memory curated by power. Historical examples from Italy, the Philippines, Hungary, Russia, Chile, South Africa, Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa, the Soviet Union, China, and Turkey show how these traits cluster and reinforce one another. The chapter argues that a single breach may be survivable, but clusters of traits signal a deeper transformation, where democracy persists in name while its substance quietly disappears.

Short Synopsis:
A conceptual chapter that catalogs sixty traits of democratic decay across five domains, showing how familiar institutions, rights, and memories are repurposed to entrench unaccountable power.

- image_prompts: {"wide": "A dimly lit, painterly 16:9 scene of a grand neoclassical parliament hall seen from above, its marble columns cracked and scaffolded, with faint light from a high skylight illuminating a large, ornate clock whose hands are missing. Around the chamber, shadowy figures rearrange stacks of legal books into barricades while others quietly paint over murals of past protests. The mood is somber and reflective, evoking institutional decay and the subtle repurposing of democratic spaces.", "square": "A realistic, painterly 1:1 still life of a worn constitution book on a wooden desk, its pages marked with red annotations and crossed-out clauses. Beside it sit a judge’s gavel, a stack of money, a small surveillance camera, and a faded photograph partially burned at the edges. In the background, a blurred wall of filing cabinets with some drawers ajar suggests hidden archives and manipulated memory."}
- clock_time_reference: This is a non-week conceptual chapter, so the Democracy Clock does not move: zero traits are scored as changing, and the minutes remain unchanged. Instead of tracking erosion or repair in time, the chapter defines the sixty traits that future weeks will measure.
