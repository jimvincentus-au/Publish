In the third week of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock held at 8:02 p.m., but only because aggressive executive overreach met equally determined resistance. The White House moved to dismantle USAID, freeze foreign aid, and hand effective influence over federal payment and personnel systems to Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency.” Emergency tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, sweeping attacks on DEI and transgender rights, and purges at the Justice Department and FBI consolidated power over money, law, and identity. Mass pardons for January 6 defendants and sanctions on the International Criminal Court recast accountability as persecution. At the same time, federal judges blocked a federal funds freeze, coerced civil-service buyouts, and parts of the anti-trans and birthright citizenship orders. Unions, state legislatures, and protesters turned to litigation and the streets. The week’s stasis on the clock masks a rapid internal rearrangement of authority, with private actors embedded ever deeper in the machinery of the state.
