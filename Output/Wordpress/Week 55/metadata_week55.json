A large, old-fashioned clock face hovers faintly in the sky, its hands frozen, as papers marked with ballot designs and legal documents swirl through the air. Painterly, realistic style, moody winter light, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 55 of Trump\u2019s second term left the Democracy Clock fixed at 8:12 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked intense structural movement. Federal immigration forces operated as domestic security troops in Minneapolis and beyond, killing civilians, surrounding schools, and gassing largely peaceful protesters while courts and local officials issued only partial restraints. The Justice Department and FBI seized 2020 ballots in Georgia, sued states for full voter rolls, and paired a proof\u2011of\u2011citizenship order with rhetoric about ICE at polling places, advancing a federalized, securitized vision of elections. Inside the state, civil\u2011service protections and whistleblower safeguards were stripped back, police\u2011misconduct oversight was gutted, and public funds and foreign investments increasingly intertwined with Trump\u2011linked ventures and personal branding demands. Simultaneously, museums, school terminology, and heavily managed Epstein files showed history and scandal being edited from above. Resistance\u2014from judges, state voting\u2011rights bills, protests, and investigative outlets\u2014held the line but did not reverse these trajectories.",
