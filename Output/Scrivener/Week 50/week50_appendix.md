Week 50 Appendix: Crony Governance as Structure
This week’s events depict an executive-centered system increasingly operating outside effective checks, with immigration, foreign policy, and culture used as primary arenas of authoritarian consolidation. Trump’s serial emergency claims, unilateral military actions in Venezuela and Nigeria, and expansive National Guard deployments—only partially checked by the Supreme Court—drive strong pressure on traits 1, 5, 9, and 11. Immigration policy becomes a core tool of stratified citizenship and state violence: mass denaturalization targets, warehouse detention expansion, a $100m ICE recruitment blitz, and deportations in defiance of court orders sharply worsen traits 4, 22, 47, and 50. Simultaneously, crony capitalism and structural corruption deepen: bailout favoritism, Medicare rule manipulation after a $5m PAC donation, and the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency hollowing out agencies entrench traits 16, 26, 29, 38, and 40. The information environment is further degraded by visa bans on anti-disinformation figures, corporate censorship of investigative reporting, and presidential disinformation campaigns, intensifying traits 21, 52, 53, and 60. Countervailing forces—federal court rulings on National Guard deployments, CFPB funding, deportation abuses, and some corporate pushback against hate media—provide limited but notable democratic resistance.
