The raid was reportedly linked to workplace safety issues, as three workers had died in accidents at the site over the past two years. The presence of undocumented workers may have contributed to a culture of fear, preventing safety complaints. The raid has raised concerns about the future of the project and U.S.-South Korea trade relations, as the plant is part of a significant investment by South Korea in the U.S.",
