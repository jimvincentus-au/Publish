Week 8 of Trump’s second term marks a structural turn rather than a noisy aberration. The Democracy Clock jumps 13.3 minutes, from 9:32 to 9:45 p.m., as executive power, economic privilege, and information control move in concert. The civil service is hollowed out through mass firings, union-busting, and privatization orchestrated by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, even as federal judges order tens of thousands rehired and pry open DOGE’s records. Citizenship is openly stratified: an assault on birthright citizenship advances in the courts, activists like Mahmoud Khalil are detained on foreign-policy pretexts, and family detention and deportations resume. Law is wielded as a weapon—pardons for January 6 rioters, punitive orders against disfavored law firms, selective leniency for donors—while agencies are repurposed to serve crypto, fossil fuel, and oligarchic interests. Archives are ordered destroyed, independent global media defunded, and protest reframed as terrorism. Institutions still resist, but the week’s pattern reads less like improvisation than a governing design.
