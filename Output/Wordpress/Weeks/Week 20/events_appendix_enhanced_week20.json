This move is expected to impact a wide range of consumer products, including groceries, as these metals are commonly used in packaging. The decision could lead to increased prices for items such as beer, soda, and canned goods, affecting both consumers and manufacturers. The tariff increase is part of Trump's broader trade policy, which has been criticized for potentially slowing economic growth.",

During the hearing, she expressed uncertainty about whether teaching Black history, specifically the Tulsa race massacre and Ruby Bridges' story, would violate the Trump administration's policies against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). McMahon also faced questions about the legality of teaching Ruby Bridges' book and the accuracy of teaching the 2020 election results. Her responses indicated a lack of clarity on these issues, raising concerns about the administration's stance on educational content.",
