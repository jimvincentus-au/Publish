The freeze, initially mandated by an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memo, was intended to ensure compliance with executive orders against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Despite the rescission of the memo and subsequent court orders prohibiting the freeze, NIH staff have been instructed to halt nearly all grant funding. This action has significantly reduced the number of grants issued, threatening ongoing biomedical research. Legal experts assert that the administration is in contempt of court.",

The decision was reportedly made on political grounds, with a memo stating that the case restricted Adams's ability to assist in deportation efforts. The move has drawn comparisons to the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre due to the number of resignations and has sparked widespread dismay in the legal community.",
