Trump’s second inauguration opens not with a single rupture but with a dense cascade of executive orders, emergencies, and personnel purges that rapidly redefine what counts as normal governance. Within days, border and energy “emergencies,” Schedule F, and the creation of DOGE pull immigration, energy, foreign aid, and digital infrastructure into the orbit of the presidency, sidelining Congress and internal watchdogs. Birthright citizenship is attacked by decree, asylum and refugee programs are suspended, and ICE and the military are deployed as instruments of domestic control. Law is inverted: January 6 rioters and anti‑abortion offenders are pardoned while DOJ civil‑rights enforcement, FCPA prosecutions, and police‑misconduct tracking are frozen. DEI programs, gender protections, and reproductive‑rights safeguards are dismantled as religion and nationalist symbolism are mobilized to justify exclusion. A sovereign wealth fund, bitcoin reserve, and presidential meme coins fuse public policy with private enrichment. Courts, states, unions, and civil‑society groups respond with lawsuits, wage hikes, and organizing, but always a beat behind an executive that has made chaos and speed its governing method. The Democracy Clock moves eight minutes later, registering a sharp, coordinated bend in the guardrails of American democracy.
