<h1>Week 5 Appendix: The State as Personal Instrument</h1>
<p><em>Mass firings, data seizures, and cultural erasures turned the federal government into a more personal, less accountable tool of rule in a single dense week.</em></p>
<p>This week reads like a concentrated stress test of nearly every democratic safeguard at once. The Trump–Musk DOGE project accelerates into a de facto parallel state: mass firings across health, environmental, safety, and foreign-aid agencies; aggressive efforts to seize IRS, SSA, and education data; and court rulings that largely greenlight the purge. Executive orders centralize control over independent regulators, reinterpret legality via the unitary executive, and weaponize budget freezes and deregulation against Congress’s appropriations power. Simultaneously, the justice system is bent toward impunity for allies and pressure on critics: corruption charges against Eric Adams are dropped under political pressure, whistleblower and watchdog protections are attacked, and Kash Patel is installed to redirect the FBI’s focus. Information control intensifies through bans and lawsuits against AP, ideological cleansing of military schools and federal websites, and erasure of LGBTQ+ and Black history. Abroad, U.S. policy tilts toward Russia and China at Ukraine’s expense, with mineral-grab diplomacy and exclusionary peace talks. Civil society, unions, states, and some courts push back, but the structural pressure this week overwhelmingly entrenches authoritarian drift.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump signed an executive order empowering Elon Musk's Doge committee to shrink the federal workforce: Granting a private-led committee authority over federal staffing concentrated executive power in an unelected actor and weakened normal civil service and oversight channels.
