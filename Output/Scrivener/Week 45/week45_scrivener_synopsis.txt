Week 45 of Trump’s second term left the Democracy Clock unmoved at 8:11 p.m., but only because damage and resistance briefly balanced. The administration intensified its use of law and security institutions against opponents, branding a veterans’ video on unlawful orders as “seditious,” unleashing Pentagon and FBI investigations into six Democratic lawmakers, and dangling court-martial for Senator Mark Kelly. At the same time, Trump issued sweeping pardons that likely cover 2020 election crimes, while Georgia courts dismissed the last racketeering case over his interference. Inside the Justice Department, purges hollowed civil-rights and public-integrity work, even as some courts sanctioned Trump for frivolous suits, blocked Texas gerrymanders, and protected due process in deportations. Immigration and citizenship became tools of stratification: TPS terminations, mass status reviews, child detentions, and threats to de‑naturalize “non‑compatible” citizens. Executive orders, emergency powers, and curated information--from coal-plant mandates and lethal boat strikes to canceled GDP data, CDC edits, and LGBTQ book purges--consolidated a method of rule that relies on fear, opacity, and selective protection.
