Title
-----
The Capital as Test Case

Subtitle
--------
A federal crime ‘emergency’ in Washington becomes the proving ground for rule by emergency, loyalist data, and stratified citizenship.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
In the capital’s streets and spreadsheets alike, power experiments with ruling by emergency first and apologizing—partially and late—only when forced.

Synopses
--------
Long Synopsis:
Week 30 centers on Washington, DC, where a manufactured “crime emergency” allowed the White House to seize effective control of local policing, deploy National Guard troops, and threaten homeless residents with expulsion. The move briefly subordinated the Metropolitan Police Department to federal command and signaled that disfavored jurisdictions—especially sanctuary cities and Democratic strongholds—could be disciplined by force. Legal and political pushback in DC and California forced partial retreats, but only after the precedent was set. Beyond the capital, immigration enforcement grew harsher and more arbitrary, citizenship more stratified, and security forces more clearly aligned with regime narratives than with public safety. Inside the state, statistical agencies and the civil service were purged and repopulated with loyalists, while economic and environmental policy tilted further toward crony capitalism and privatization. Courts, activists, and some governors resisted, yet the Democracy Clock’s shift to 11:14 p.m. records a tightening circle around democratic life.

Short Synopsis:
A staged crime “emergency” in Washington, DC tests how far federal power can override local self-government, while immigration crackdowns, loyalist data, and crony capitalism deepen systemic erosion.

- image_prompts: {"wide": "A twilight 16:9 painting of Washington, DC streets under a hazy sky, National Guard troops and unmarked federal vehicles lining an otherwise ordinary block of rowhouses, the U.S. Capitol dome distant and slightly out of focus. Streetlights cast long shadows over a small encampment of tents being cleared by uniformed officers. A large, old-fashioned clock on a nearby building reads just past 11:14, its glass slightly cracked. The mood is tense and uneasy, with muted colors and realistic detail, evoking blurred lines between policing and occupation.", "square": "A 1:1 realistic still life of a worn District of Columbia flag folded beneath a heavy federal badge, a small gavel, and a stack of redacted legal documents. Beside them sits a brass desk clock frozen at 11:14, its face reflected in a darkened computer screen showing faint graphs and numbers. The lighting is dramatic and painterly, suggesting contested authority, data manipulation, and shrinking space for civic autonomy."}
- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock moved from 11:13 p.m. to 11:14 p.m., a shift of 1.7 minutes toward midnight. It marks a modest numerical change that nonetheless captures a dense consolidation of executive power, normalized emergency framing, and structural stratification of citizenship.
