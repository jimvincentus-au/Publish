\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 27 records no visible shift in the Democracy Clock, holding at 7:58 p.m., yet the narrative is one of consolidation rather than stasis. Trump orders partisan redistricting in Texas and tests control over voting machines in Colorado, embedding structural advantages under the banner of integrity. Immigration enforcement expands into masked raids, courthouse arrests, and a vast detention infrastructure, deepening a two-tier system of citizenship. The Justice Department becomes an overt political instrument, launching a strike force against Obama officials, ending police reform consent decrees, and selectively shielding Epstein records while curating historical disclosures. Media and universities are bent through funding, mergers, and litigation, as AI-driven disinformation and doctored videos flood the information space. Simultaneously, the administrative state is hollowed out and repurposed toward donor and crypto interests. Courts and tribal institutions offer pockets of resistance, but mostly as brakes on a regime increasingly comfortable using law, bureaucracy, and narrative chaos to manage dissent.\
