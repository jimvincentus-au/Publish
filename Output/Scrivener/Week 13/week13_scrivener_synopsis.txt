Week 13 of Trump’s second term was defined less by a single rupture than by the coordinated use of law, bureaucracy, and information to tilt the landscape toward obedience. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:56 to 7:57 p.m., a 0.2‑minute shift that masked deepening structural erosion. The administration openly tested judicial authority in the Kilmar Ábrego García saga, defying a unanimous Supreme Court order while classifying its El Salvador prison deal and seeking to block contempt. Immigration and citizenship tools were wielded against students, activists, transgender people, and even citizens, as mass visa revocations, social‑media vetting, and proof‑of‑citizenship voting rules advanced. Civil rights enforcement was inverted: disparate‑impact liability gutted, the DOJ Civil Rights Division repurposed, and federal funds used to coerce states and schools. Universities and media faced funding freezes, tax and licensing threats, and book bans, while transparency sites and Covid.gov were rewritten or removed. Tariff whiplash, deregulation, and civil service politicization entrenched crony capitalism. Courts, states, universities, and civil society pushed back, but mostly after the fact, as the distance between formal rights and lived security widened.
