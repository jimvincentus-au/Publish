\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 10 of Trump\'92s second term compressed into a single method: rule by legal retribution. The Democracy Clock\'92s face stayed fixed at 7:49 p.m., yet the machinery behind it shifted. A barrage of executive orders weaponized national security, immigration, and administrative law against disfavored law firms, migrants, students, unions, and universities. The Alien Enemies Act was revived to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador\'92s mega-prison, sometimes in defiance of court orders. A sweeping \'93election integrity\'94 order imposed documentary proof-of-citizenship and empowered a Musk-linked agency to mine voter rolls, tightening access to the franchise. Simultaneously, collective bargaining rights for over a million federal workers were stripped, agencies gutted, and DOGE operatives embedded in Social Security. The Signal war-plans scandal exposed senior officials planning airstrikes on an auto-deleting app while the White House refused accountability. Courts, watchdogs, and universities fought back with injunctions and lawsuits, but the week\'92s net effect was to entrench executive overreach, crony governance, and stratified citizenship under a veneer of legality.\
