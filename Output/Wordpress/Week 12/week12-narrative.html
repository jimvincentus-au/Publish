<h1>Week 12: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance</h1>
<p><em>Tariffs, deportations, and funding threats fused into a single method of rule, tightening executive control while leaving formal institutions visibly intact.</em></p>

<p>The twelfth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single shock. It unfolded as a dense layering of moves that, taken together, made the state feel less like a shared instrument and more like a set of levers in one man’s hands. Economic policy, immigration enforcement, education funding, and even the national story about history and faith were all pulled into a common pattern. Power was centralized, dissent was made costly, and the line between public duty and personal or factional interest grew thinner.</p>
<p>At the close of Week 11, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:56 p.m. It ended Week 12 at the same public time, with a net movement of 0.4 minutes deeper into danger. The face of the clock did not change, but its mechanism did. The week’s small numerical shift captured a broad consolidation rather than a rupture: emergency tariff powers used as a personal economic weapon, immigration law stretched into a mass‑deportation machine, universities and law firms disciplined through money and law, and information about climate, race, and foreign influence selectively withheld or rewritten. Institutions still acted, sometimes with courage, yet more often they were bent, bypassed, or absorbed. That is how a system shifts without a single headline break.</p>
<p>The most visible expression of this consolidation came through tariffs. Early in the week, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping global tariffs, treating a Cold War statute as a standing license to reorder trade without Congress. New duties on China and dozens of other countries were announced, raised, and recombined in rapid succession, with effective rates on some Chinese imports climbing into triple digits. What would once have been the product of long negotiation and legislative debate now arrived as a series of presidential declarations framed as “Liberation Day” for American industry. Trade policy became a personal lever.</p>
<p>Markets and analysts reacted in real time. Major banks raised their estimates of recession risk, citing tariff shocks as the central driver. Indices swung sharply as investors tried to price in the new costs and the uncertainty around what might come next. Unusual trading patterns around tariff announcements prompted calls for insider‑trading investigations, suggesting that those closest to power could profit from volatility that ordinary workers and consumers would simply have to endure. Tesla’s decision to halt orders for certain models in China showed how quickly export‑dependent firms could be squeezed by reciprocal measures abroad. The pain spread fast.</p>
<p>Foreign governments did not wait. China, the European Union, Canada, and others announced retaliatory tariffs and countermeasures, deepening the trade war and threatening sectors far from the original targets. Yet corporate America, which might once have been a loud brake on such policy, remained largely silent. Reporting suggested that major firms feared regulatory retaliation if they spoke out, a silence that itself marked a shift in the balance between private economic power and the presidency. The White House, meanwhile, insisted that iPhones would soon be made in the United States, despite industry skepticism, and used press events to misstate historical economic policy and sell the tariff campaign as a patriotic correction. The message was loyalty, not candor.</p>
<p>As the damage mounted, the president abruptly announced a 90‑day pause on parts of the plan. The partial retreat did not come with a clear explanation or a new framework. It underscored instead how personalized and unpredictable economic governance had become: a single decision could crash markets, and another could ease them, with little input from the institutions that traditionally manage tax and trade. Congress and the courts tried to reassert themselves. Senators from both parties introduced bills to reclaim tariff authority and require legislative approval for future measures. A civil‑liberties group sued, arguing that emergency economic powers could not stand in for Congress’s taxing role. Yet House leaders aligned with the president used procedural rules to block a floor vote on disapproving the tariff emergency, turning the lower chamber into a stage for partisan performance rather than a forum for checking executive overreach.</p>
<p>The tariff story was also an information story. The White House refused to release the list of seventy‑five countries it claimed were seeking trade deals, making it impossible for the public to verify the president’s boasts. Trump reposted a fabricated video suggesting that Warren Buffett endorsed his market‑crashing strategy, injecting disinformation into the official economic narrative. In this way, emergency economic rule, opacity, and falsehood reinforced one another. The more policy was made by decree, the easier it became to surround it with unverifiable claims.</p>
<p>If tariffs showed how economic power could be centralized, immigration enforcement showed how state coercion could be widened and deepened. Across multiple agencies, the week marked a shift from targeted enforcement to a system that treated status as contingent and revocable, even for those who had followed the rules. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expanded arrests and detention of people with Temporary Protected Status, asylum seekers, and migrants who had dutifully appeared for check‑ins. The message was clear. Compliance no longer guaranteed safety.</p>
<p>Legal tools were stretched to fit this posture. The administration leaned on the Alien Enemies Act, an eighteenth‑century wartime statute, to deport Venezuelan migrants, often on the basis of tattoos or thin gang allegations. Visas and legal status for South Sudanese nationals and CBP One parolees were revoked en masse, turning lawful presence into a privilege that could be withdrawn by policy memo. Social Security numbers for some immigrants with temporary status were canceled, pushing them out of the workforce and toward “self‑deportation” without formal hearings. Rights on paper became fragile in practice.</p>
<p>Data and bureaucracy became central instruments of this regime. The IRS agreed to share undocumented taxpayers’ confidential records with DHS for enforcement, prompting resignations from agency leaders who saw the move as a breach of legal and ethical lines. ICE and Palantir‑linked systems used large databases to identify immigrants for deportation based on physical and financial attributes, while DHS announced social‑media surveillance of visa holders and applicants for “antisemitism.” A new efficiency office inside the White House, the Department of Government Efficiency, was drawn into deportation data work, further entwining technocratic tools with political priorities. The machinery of the state turned inward on the people it tracked.</p>
<p>The human cost of this system surfaced in scattered cases. A British tourist and an Australian worker were wrongfully detained or deported despite valid status. Erroneous removal notices went out to U.S. citizens and lawful residents, exposing systemic flaws that could upend lives with a letter. Border Patrol custody saw a suicide and medical neglect of a detained student, underscoring how detention conditions could endanger health and life. Immigration agents attempted to enter Los Angeles elementary schools to locate young students, only to be rebuffed by administrators, a scene that captured how enforcement was pressing into spaces once considered off‑limits. Fear spread beyond those directly targeted.</p>
<p>At the same time, the infrastructure of deportation was being privatized and expanded. The administration contracted a low‑cost carrier to operate deportation flights and committed tens of billions of dollars to new, lower‑standard private detention facilities. Coercive state power—arrest, confinement, expulsion—was thus increasingly exercised through for‑profit entities with limited transparency. While federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily preserved some protections, such as a major parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, the overall direction was toward a data‑driven, error‑prone system in which rights varied sharply by origin and perceived loyalty. Citizenship itself became stratified.</p>
<p>The courts themselves occupied an uneasy middle ground between resistance and accommodation. On one track, the Supreme Court issued emergency orders that allowed deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to proceed, narrowing collective legal remedies and pushing challenges into more executive‑friendly venues. In another case, the Court stayed and later overturned lower‑court rulings that would have required rehiring sixteen thousand purged federal probationary workers, enabling the administration’s mass dismissals to stand and weakening the independence of the civil service. Deference to executive claims carried real institutional cost.</p>
<p>Yet in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a lawful resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador, the judiciary asserted its authority. A district judge declared his removal unlawful and ordered his return. The Supreme Court then spoke with unusual clarity, issuing a unanimous directive that the government facilitate his return. The administration’s response was halting. It delayed, withheld information, and failed to comply promptly, raising a stark question: what happens when even a 9–0 Supreme Court order cannot secure swift obedience from the executive branch?</p>
<p>Other rulings showed similar tension. Federal courts blocked or limited executive orders targeting law firms that represented political rivals, preserving their ability to practice and signaling that legal advocacy could not be punished so easily. An appeals court reinstated members of independent boards like the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, reaffirming statutory limits on presidential removal. A judge halted efforts to terminate a humanitarian parole program, and another allowed the Exonerated Five’s defamation suit against Trump to proceed, underscoring that even presidents could face civil accountability for their words. At the same time, internal discipline within DOJ fell on lawyers who admitted wrongful deportations, and a senior White House aide smeared a judge as a “Marxist” for enforcing immigration law, sending a clear signal that candor and independence carried professional risk.</p>
<p>Beyond the courts, the administration turned its attention to institutions that produce knowledge and organize dissent. Columbia University was threatened with the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding over its protest and security policies, a threat later withdrawn but not forgotten. Cornell, Northwestern, and other universities saw large research and program grants frozen or canceled over diversity initiatives and campus protests. Hundreds of international students and activists had their visas revoked or were arrested, using immigration status as a lever against campus speech. Student journalists covering Palestine‑related issues faced pressure that led to takedowns and self‑censorship. The campus became a test site for controlled debate.</p>
<p>Law firms and lawyers were drawn into the same orbit. Executive orders targeted firms that represented political adversaries, restricting their access and clearances. The administration sent letters attacking diversity‑oriented hiring and secured agreements from firms to drop race‑conscious practices. Immigration attorneys and other advocates were pressured over their client choices, with some firms steered into pro bono work aligned with administration priorities. Courts intervened at points, blocking some of the most direct attacks on firms and upholding the right of the Associated Press to attend presidential events after the White House tried to condition access on adopting the term “Gulf of America.” But the pattern was clear. Access to money, clients, and platforms was increasingly tied to political compliance.</p>
<p>Nonprofits and advocacy groups were not spared. Climate organizations, civil‑rights groups, and other NGOs faced investigations and defunding when their work cut against the administration’s agenda. Cultural institutions saw their budgets threatened, prompting lawsuits from library and museum workers who argued that cuts would harm public access to knowledge. Even a children’s entertainer became the subject of a push for foreign‑agent investigation over Gaza‑related posts, illustrating how legal tools could be used to intimidate expressive activity online. Against this backdrop, civil society still moved: mass “Hands Off” protests against the Trump–Musk agenda drew crowds in hundreds of locations, Medicaid and SNAP recipients marched on Capitol Hill to oppose safety‑net cuts, and labor leaders warned that the effective nullification of union contracts for 700,000 workers was an attack on workplace democracy.</p>
<p>While these pressures mounted, Trump worked to reshape the symbolic and structural foundations of executive power. He publicly speculated about serving a third term, normalizing talk that would once have been unthinkable under the two‑term limit. On the southern border, he authorized the military to take control of public lands and created a buffer zone in which active‑duty soldiers could detain migrants on U.S. soil, blurring the line between civilian law enforcement and military power. In Washington, he announced plans for a large military parade centered on himself and proposed a record Pentagon budget, even as domestic agencies faced cuts. Spectacle and force moved to the foreground.</p>
<p>Inside the Pentagon and the defense industrial base, executive orders restructured procurement, foreign sales, and maritime policy, centralizing decisions that had long been subject to more diffuse oversight. The Senate confirmed a less‑qualified chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after waiving usual requirements, raising concerns that loyalty was displacing professional criteria at the top of the military. At the same time, the White House created a faith office and a task force to eradicate “anti‑Christian bias,” directing the State Department to catalog such bias under the prior administration. These moves gave one religious constituency privileged access to federal power and framed policy disputes through a lens of religious grievance.</p>
<p>The administrative state that might have balanced these forces was itself being hollowed out and repurposed. The Department of Government Efficiency, closely tied to Elon Musk, drove restructuring that cut staff at agencies like the Social Security Administration and steered contracts toward Musk‑linked firms. A plan to restrict phone claims at SSA, later abandoned amid warnings of a “death spiral,” showed how administrative tweaks could ration access to core benefits. The federal student loan program was moved from the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration, reframing higher education finance as a business product and straining an agency ill‑equipped for the task. Public service was recast as a set of transactions.</p>
<p>Regulatory and enforcement capacity eroded in parallel. Budgets at the Food and Drug Administration and other health and safety agencies were cut, weakening oversight of food and drugs. The Justice Department disbanded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, relaxing scrutiny of a sector prone to abuse. Scientific research grants in areas labeled “woke”—AIDS, trans issues, climate—were slashed, politicizing the questions that could be studied with federal support. Targeted cuts to Maine’s corrections programs over the housing of a trans woman in a women’s prison used fiscal levers to enforce ideological positions on incarceration and gender.</p>
<p>Privatization extended beyond deportation flights and detention centers. Public goods and coercive functions alike were increasingly delivered through contracts with firms that operated under weaker transparency and accountability rules. Within the Federal Election Commission, senior positions were designated as policy‑making or confidential under a Trump executive order, reshaping which roles were insulated from turnover and how election‑oversight staff could be managed. A Republican budget framework in the House paved the way for large tax cuts and deep future spending reductions, locking in fiscal choices that would constrain social programs and, with them, the material basis for equal participation.</p>
<p>Some in Congress tried to push back on the most blatant conflicts. A senator introduced a bill to bar contracts to companies owned by special government employees like Musk, targeting self‑dealing in procurement. Another released a report on weakened enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and proposed a Sovereign Wealth Fund Transparency Act, highlighting gaps in guarding policy from foreign money. Yet the Attorney General moved in the opposite direction, limiting FARA prosecutions and thereby reducing pressure on foreign influence operations aligned with the administration. High‑dollar fundraising dinners with domestic and Saudi donors during the tariff‑driven market turmoil underscored how access to the president and policy influence remained closely tied to wealth.</p>
<p>Voting rights and election legitimacy came under renewed strain. The House passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, requiring documentary proof of citizenship—passports, birth certificates—to register or vote and threatening officials with penalties for non‑compliance. In practice, such rules risked disenfranchising millions of eligible voters who lacked ready access to these documents, especially among marginalized communities. In North Carolina, courts ordered recounts and ID verification for tens of thousands of ballots in a state supreme court race, then demanded that overseas and military voters prove eligibility after casting their ballots, raising the prospect of discarding lawful votes under shifting post‑election standards.</p>
<p>These measures were justified by a familiar narrative. Trump renewed baseless claims that the 2020 election had been rigged and demanded restrictive voting rules, including paper‑only, same‑day voting and strict citizenship proof. Data and algorithms used by DHS and Palantir‑linked systems to identify immigrants for deportation were also deployed in voter‑fraud checks, further entwining enforcement and electoral administration. At the same time, some electoral machinery still functioned: Wisconsin certified a state supreme court election in which a Trump‑ and Musk‑backed candidate lost decisively despite heavy spending, and the Election Assistance Commission renewed advisory committees on voting systems and best practices. These pockets of normalcy, however, existed within a broader trend toward making the franchise more contingent and bureaucratized.</p>
<p>Control over information and memory formed the backdrop to all of this. An executive order directed the Smithsonian and other research entities to purge “improper” or “anti‑American” ideology from their content, turning national museums into potential vehicles for state‑approved narratives. The Pentagon ordered a “digital content refresh” to remove diversity, race, and LGBTQ‑related terms from its platforms. The National Park Service edited an Underground Railroad webpage to remove Harriet Tubman and slavery references, then partially restored them under scrutiny, a small episode that nonetheless revealed active federal shaping of how racial history is told.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge was targeted as well. Funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the national climate assessment was terminated, curtailing the production of authoritative climate data. Grants for research on AIDS, trans issues, and climate were cut under the banner of fighting “woke” science. At the state level, the Mississippi Library Commission deleted race relations and gender studies databases from public access, aligning library content with anti‑DEI laws and narrowing the range of perspectives available in schools and libraries. These moves did not ban inquiry outright. They made it harder, costlier, and less visible.</p>
<p>Transparency about power and influence eroded in parallel. The White House’s refusal to release its claimed list of trade‑partner countries, the scaling back of FARA enforcement, and sanctions on cooperation with the International Criminal Court all reduced the flow of information about foreign influence and war‑crimes investigations. Press access was conditioned on adopting executive rebranding of geographic terms, and only a court order restored the Associated Press’s place in the briefing room. Corporations, wary of retaliation, stayed quiet about tariffs that harmed their own interests. In this environment, data and algorithms were used not to illuminate public choices but to target individuals for enforcement and to justify policies whose full contours the public could not see.</p>
<p>Law and security tools sat at the center of this landscape. Trump ordered DOJ to investigate former officials Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs and to strip their clearances, a direct use of prosecutorial and security powers to punish internal critics. In a televised Oval Office event, he signed executive orders aimed at political opponents, turning the act of punishment into spectacle. The administration sought to reimburse pardoned January 6 defendants for restitution payments, further insulating them from consequences for attacking democratic institutions. At the same time, it limited enforcement of foreign‑influence laws and sanctioned International Criminal Court collaborators, shielding some forms of elite wrongdoing while targeting those who pursued accountability.</p>
<p>Internal and external checks persisted, but in narrowed form. Courts blocked some executive orders against law firms, restored AP access, and allowed high‑profile civil suits to proceed. Congress held hearings on judicial power and summoned the vaccine‑skeptical health secretary to account for a deadly measles outbreak, exercising oversight over public health leadership and misinformation. Senate investigators documented weakened FARA enforcement even as the Attorney General moved to limit it further. These actions showed that institutional muscle remained, but they also revealed how much effort was now required to secure what had once been routine.</p>
<p>No single development in Week 12 transformed the system. The clock’s face did not jump. Instead, the week deepened an existing pattern: emergency powers used as normal tools, law bent toward friends and against foes, universities and agencies steered by threat and reward, and the informational ground under citizens’ feet made less stable. Resistance appeared—in courtrooms, on campuses, in the streets—but it was reactive, often confined to individual cases or narrow domains. The structure of power continued to tilt toward a presidency that governs by decree, backed by a security and information apparatus increasingly aligned with its interests.</p>
<p>In that sense, the week marked not a turning but a settling. The methods of the early term—tariff shocks, immigration crackdowns, funding threats, narrative control—were applied with greater confidence and less visible hesitation. Rights and procedures remained on paper, but invoking them demanded more courage and carried higher cost. Democratic safety eroded not through open rupture, but through the steady normalization of what had once been extraordinary.</p>
