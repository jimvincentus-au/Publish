Week 10 of Trump’s second term was defined less by spectacle than by coordinated structural moves. A sweeping executive order imposed documentary proof-of-citizenship for federal voter registration, threatened noncompliant states with funding losses, and opened state voter rolls to a new executive-controlled data agency, DOGE. Parallel initiatives expanded surveillance of immigrants and voters through tax data sharing and social media vetting, even as funding for domestic terrorism and hate-crime tracking was cut. Immigration tools were used to punish dissent, with student protesters targeted for deportation and offshore detention floated as a threat. In law and elite justice, targeted orders and coercive pro-bono deals disciplined disfavored firms while pardons and floated compensation for January 6 offenders rewarded allies. Public health, research, and media funding were redirected along ideological and crony lines. Courts and civil society mounted partial resistance, but the Democracy Clock’s slight 0.2-minute shift masked a deeper consolidation of executive power.
