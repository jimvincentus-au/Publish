<h1>Week 30 Appendix: Emergency as Method in Washington</h1>
<p><em>A manufactured crime crisis in the capital anchors a week of legal experiments, militarized governance, and quiet capture of neutral institutions.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with Washington, D.C. effectively used as a laboratory for federal overreach. Trump’s declaration of a crime emergency, repeated deployments of National Guard and federal agents, and attempted federalization of the D.C. police (wk030-023, -048, -049, -095, -122–125) push hard on emergency normalization, federal weaponization against disfavored jurisdictions, and the alignment of security forces with regime priorities (traits 1, 5, 9, 11). Parallel moves—threats to overturn D.C. home rule (wk030-012), prosecution threats to sanctuary cities (wk030-107, -128), and the use of immigration raids with lethal consequences (wk030-138)—extend this pattern nationwide. Institutional guardrails respond unevenly: courts restore a spending database and democracy funding, block some DEI and detention abuses, and partially roll back the D.C. takeover (wk030-002, -013, -028, -061, -084, -126–127), but an appeals court greenlights mass firings at the CFPB and foreign-aid cuts (wk030-087, -133), entrenching capture of key agencies (traits 13–16, 22). Simultaneously, Christian nationalist and personalist projects advance through Hegseth’s attacks on women’s and LGBTQ rights and religiously inflected military policy (wk030-017, -032, -051, -120–121), while statistical and cultural institutions are politicized (wk030-045, -074, -075, -094).</p>
