# Week 18 Appendix: Inequality as Governance

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and partisan power across multiple fronts, with only sporadic judicial pushback. The centerpiece is passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a reconciliation mega‑package that locks in regressive tax cuts, slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and green incentives, and massively expands deportation and detention funding. That bill, combined with Moody’s downgrade, underscores how fiscal and social policy are being engineered to entrench inequality and offload risk onto the public. Parallel moves target the administrative state: mass firings and attempted dismantling of CFPB, VA, civil rights enforcement, and the Institute of Peace; politicized investigations; and Supreme Court orders strengthening a unitary executive and weakening independent agencies. Immigration and policing policy harden sharply—TPS for Venezuelans revoked, mass ICE arrests at courts, deportations to conflict zones, and efforts to cancel police reform decrees—while courts intermittently intervene to protect due process and block some agency purges. Information control and culture‑war governance deepen via Oklahoma’s election‑fraud curriculum, Harvard visa revocations, Pentagon press restrictions, and DEI rollbacks. Overall, structural pressure is strongly negative: executive overreach, legalized inequality, and weaponized law advance faster than institutional correctives can contain them.
