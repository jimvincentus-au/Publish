However, the organization is involved in a new development project, Trump Tower Belgrade, in partnership with a private Serbian company. The project is on land owned by the Serbian government, raising questions about the ethics statement's validity. Eric Trump, managing the organization, asserts compliance by partnering with a private entity rather than the government directly.",

      "summary": "President Donald Trump announced plans to expand the Guantánamo Bay detention facility to accommodate a new 30,000-person migrant facility. This move is part of his \"mass deportation\" campaign, targeting \"criminal illegal aliens\" and aiming to deter migrant crime. The directive instructs the heads of the defense and homeland security departments to prepare the facility, which has historically been used for detaining terror suspects. The announcement has sparked significant controversy and condemnation, with critics arguing it conflates migrants with terrorists and undermines legal and human rights protections.",
