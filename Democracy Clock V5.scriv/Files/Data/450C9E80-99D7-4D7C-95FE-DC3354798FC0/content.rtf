\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 45 Appendix: Emergencies as Everyday Rule\
\
This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive branch asserting sweeping, weakly checked power across domestic, legal, and foreign-policy domains. The most acute pressures fell on rule-of-law traits: politicized prosecutions and purges at DOJ, broad election-related pardons, dismissal of Trump election cases, and threats of military tribunals for opponents collectively weaponize law rather than limit it. Civil\'96military boundaries blurred further as National Guard deployments in DC, investigations of Senator Mark Kelly, and alleged illegal kill orders normalized military tools in domestic and extralegal contexts. Immigration and citizenship were aggressively re-stratified through TPS terminations, refugee reviews, mass detentions, and even threats to de-naturalize citizens, embedding second-class status by origin. Information manipulation and chaos politics intensified via cancellation of economic data, CDC science interference, Ukraine peace-plan disinformation, and censorship campaigns against libraries and universities. Yet there were pockets of institutional resistance\'97federal courts sanctioning Trump, blocking Texas maps, and ordering FOIA compliance; civil society boycotts and protests forcing Border Patrol\'92s retreat\'97showing that while executive-centered authoritarian drift is deepening, countervailing forces remain active but outmatched this week.\
