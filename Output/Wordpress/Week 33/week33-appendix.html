<h1>Week 33 Appendix: Authoritarian Powers as Policy</h1>
<p><em>A week of near-stillness on the Democracy Clock masks how executive orders, security forces, and lawfare quietly consolidate personal rule and stratified citizenship.</em></p>
<p>This week delivers an intense, multi-front stress test on American democracy, with especially heavy pressure on executive constraint, civil liberties, and the integrity of the administrative state. The White House aggressively expands unilateral authority—over elections (voter ID and mail voting orders), immigration (Alien Enemies Act, mass deportation machinery, third‑country offshoring), trade (emergency-based tariffs, Japan order), and military force (Caribbean strike, domestic Guard deployments, Pentagon rebrand). Simultaneously, core technocratic institutions—CDC, FDA, EPA, SSA, USAGM, PBS, Northwestern, Harvard—are purged, defunded, or disciplined, often in favor of loyalists and anti‑expert ideologues, entrenching patronage over competence. Immigration and policing policy move toward a quasi‑security state: mass ICE/CBP hiring with lowered standards, spyware, military lawyers as judges, and incentives for local police to join federal crackdowns. Yet courts, states, and some in Congress mount counter‑moves: major rulings against tariffs and military deployments, blocks on child deportations, state resistance on vaccines and wind, and bipartisan pushes for Epstein transparency. Structurally, however, the week tilts strongly toward normalized emergency governance, militarized domestic order, and a politicized bureaucracy aligned with the president’s personal and electoral interests.</p>
