\f0\fs26 \cf0 Metadata for Week 7\
===================\
\
Title\
-----\
Universities and Visas as Leverage\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A week of quiet tightening, as executive power weaponized law, data, and funding against universities, migrants, and civil servants while courts fought rear-guard actions.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
The hour did not change, but the week showed how easily ordinary policy can become a quiet state of exception.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 7 of Trump\'92s second term traced a dense pattern of consolidation rather than a single rupture. The administration accelerated its hollowing of the civil service, driving mass resignations at State, sidelining the CFPB, and planning deep cuts at IRS, VA, and Social Security, even as the Merit Systems Protection Board and courts clawed back some illegal firings. Universities and schools became central targets: Georgetown and Columbia faced federal threats to funding and hiring pipelines, while a donor-backed book-banning tour turned local school boards into ideological battlegrounds. Law and data were redeployed as weapons\'97AI-assisted visa revocations for foreign students, punitive tweaks to Public Service Loan Forgiveness, an executive order singling out Perkins Coie, and algorithmic surveillance that left elite misconduct opaque. Tariff whiplash and a politicized \'93crypto reserve\'94 fused economic chaos with insider enrichment. Courts, state legislatures, and civil society mounted visible resistance, but mostly slowed rather than reversed a tightening vise. The Democracy Clock\'92s hands stayed at 7:44 p.m., even as its gears crept forward.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
Executive power grew more comfortable using law, data, and money to punish enemies and reward allies, especially in universities, immigration, and civil service, while courts and civil society managed only partial, reactive pushback.\

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock\'92s public face remained at 7:44 p.m., but the underlying measure advanced from 464.0 to 464.5 minutes. That half-minute shift marks modest net erosion: structural damage to oversight, civil service, and equal citizenship slightly outpaced meaningful, but limited, pushback from courts, state legislatures, and civil society.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A 1:1 symbolic still life: a stack of law books and a university diploma on a wooden desk, bound together by red tape stamped with a presidential seal. Beside them lie a revoked visa, a USB drive glowing with binary code, and a small desk clock fixed at 7:44 p.m. A single desk lamp casts sharp shadows, suggesting scrutiny and quiet coercion. Painterly, realistic style.", "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of a grand neoclassical government building and a university campus facing each other across a plaza, with a large clock tower in the background frozen at 7:44 p.m. Subtle cracks run through the stone steps and pillars, while faint digital code and surveillance camera icons hover in the sky like constellations. Small groups of protesters with indistinct signs gather near barricades, while suited figures slip through a side entrance. Painterly, realistic style, moody, with cool blues and muted golds."\}\
