Week 47 of Trump’s second term was defined less by a single rupture than by layered consolidation. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:11 p.m., but only because courts, state governments, and civil society expended extraordinary effort to offset heavy authoritarian pressure. Immigration policy became a laboratory for a two-tier order: Afghan asylum decisions were halted, entry from nineteen non‑European countries paused, protections for non‑citizen veterans rescinded, and a $140 million deportation air fleet and militarized border zone built out. A proposed “Trump Gold Card” would sell citizenship outright. Security forces were deployed domestically and abroad with expanding unilateral claims, from Caribbean strikes raising war‑crimes concerns to Guard deployments and federalization of D.C. police, while oversight arrived late and partially. Law and regulation bent toward allies and investors: pardons for a bribery‑tainted congressman, pressure on the ICC, efforts to control independent agencies, AI and trade policy shaped by elite and foreign capital, and symbolic projects like a White House ballroom and Trump‑branded park passes. Against this, state laws, court rulings, boycotts, and organizing managed only to hold the visible line as the moral floor continued to erode.
