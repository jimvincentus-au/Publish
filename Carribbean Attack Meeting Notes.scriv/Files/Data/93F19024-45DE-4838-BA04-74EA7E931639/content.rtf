\f0\b\fs30 \cf2 Acknowledgment of the Seriousness of the Situation \'97 Draft
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
\'93We need to begin by recognizing the gravity of why we are here. Reports of civilian deaths at the hands of military actors in the Caribbean\'97still emerging, still not fully verified\'97raise profound concerns about human rights, rule of law, and the safety of vulnerable communities. Even incomplete information can have real human consequences, and it is essential that we approach this issue with humility, care, and responsibility.\
\
We acknowledge that lives may have been lost, that families and communities may be suffering, and that government transparency to date has been limited. These are not abstract policy questions; they involve real human beings whose rights and dignity matter.\
\
Because of that, our work tonight must be grounded in facts, guided by lawful and ethical principles, and shaped by our shared commitment to protecting life and accountability while avoiding speculation or actions that could unintentionally cause harm.\'94}
