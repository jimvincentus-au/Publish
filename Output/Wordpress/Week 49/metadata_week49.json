  "long_synopsis": "Week 49 of Trump\u2019s second term traced how a government can keep its visible routines while its inner gears slip toward impunity. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:11 p.m., moving only 0.1 minutes, yet the small numerical change masked a deeper consolidation. The Justice Department treated the Epstein Files Transparency Act as optional, missing deadlines, issuing illegally redacted releases, and quietly removing or misfiling politically sensitive records, even as it leaked and litigated in ways that shielded allies and targeted critics. National Guard deployments and funding threats pushed past judicial limits on immigration enforcement and federalism, while environmental, veterans, and financial regulators were repurposed to favor fossil fuels, ideological causes, and officials\u2019 own investments. Mass detention infrastructure expanded, civil service capacity was hollowed out, and violence and intimidation against journalists rose. Courts and some in Congress pushed back at the margins, but oversight increasingly raised costs rather than set boundaries. The clock\u2019s face held steady while the machinery of accountability wore down.",
