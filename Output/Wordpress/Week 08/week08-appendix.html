<h1>Week 8 Appendix: Citizenship and Service as Leverage</h1>
<p><em>A week of quiet decrees and targeted enforcement hollowed institutions, stratified belonging, and turned law and budgets into tools of loyalty and fear.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and systematic weaponization of law and immigration against dissenters and minorities. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus drive mass firings, lease terminations, and deep cuts across education, science, public health, and social welfare, while courts begin to push back—ordering reinstatement of thousands of workers, blocking teacher-training cuts, and forcing DOGE transparency. Immigration enforcement is overtly repurposed to punish pro‑Palestinian activism, with Khalil’s detention under a foreign‑policy pretext, visa revocations, family detention, and plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Simultaneously, the administration seeks to end birthright citizenship, normalize emergency powers around tariffs and the border, and retaliate against disfavored law firms. Internationally, the US abandons climate and anti‑corruption leadership, escalates trade wars with allies, flirts with NATO withdrawal, and aligns more openly with Russian aims. Civil society mobilizes—mass protests, town halls, watchdog tools like the Musk Watch tracker—but faces surveillance, subpoenas, and delegitimization as “terrorists.” Structurally, this is a high‑pressure week of authoritarian drift, partially checked by an increasingly assertive judiciary.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Donald Trump ordered transgender women in federal custody transferred to men's prisons despite court rulings: The order overrode prior court blocks and placed transgender women in men's facilities, signaling willingness to defy judicial limits and exposing a vulnerable group to heightened risk from state power. (2025-03-08)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency expanded centralized presidential control over agencies and empowered Elon Musk to drive deep federal downsizing: By delegating sweeping restructuring authority to a presidentially aligned unit, the administration concentrated operational power in the executive, weakening traditional bureaucratic and congressional checks. (2025-03-08)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a taxpayer-backed US Crypto Reserve: The new reserve used public funds to bolster a politically connected industry, blending state financial power with private crypto interests and raising concerns about capture of economic policy.

(2025-03-08)</li>
<li>Department of Homeland Security eliminated union protections for tens of thousands of TSA employees: Stripping collective bargaining rights from frontline security staff reduced worker voice in a key security agency and demonstrated use of executive power to weaken organized labor in the public sector. (2025-03-09)</li>
<li>Department of Health and Human Services offered large buyouts to tens of thousands of employees during a measles outbreak: Mass voluntary buyouts in the middle of a public health emergency risked hollowing out response capacity, illustrating how executive-driven staffing cuts can endanger basic protections. (2025-03-09)</li>
<li>Social Security Administration changed overpayment recovery rules to allow 100% benefit withholding: Authorizing full benefit clawbacks from overpaid recipients, regardless of fault, gave the agency harsh collection power over vulnerable beneficiaries, heightening economic precarity for many. (2025-03-09)</li>
<li>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced an administration goal to shrink and privatize federal services: Framing privatization as a core response to economic strain signaled a strategic shift away from public provision of key services, with implications for accountability and universal access. (2025-03-09)</li>

(2025-03-14)</li>

(2025-03-13)</li>
<li>Congress used the Congressional Review Act to overturn an EPA methane waste emissions charge rule: The disapproval blocked a climate-related fee on oil and gas emissions, showing how legislative oversight can be used to dismantle regulatory tools for environmental accountability.

(2025-03-11)</li>

(2025-03-13)</li>
<li>Census Bureau canceled multiple advisory committee meetings related to the 2030 Census and racial and ethnic populations: Scrapping planned advisory sessions reduced structured input from experts and communities into census planning, potentially affecting representation and resource allocation decisions.

<li>Department of Education under Secretary Linda McMahon laid off roughly half of its workforce in a mass firing: The large-scale staff reduction, framed as efficiency, severely constrained the department’s ability to administer aid and enforce education laws, and advanced a stated goal of winding the agency down. (2025-03-12)</li>
<li>Coalition of Democratic state attorneys general sued to block the Education Department’s mass layoffs as unconstitutional and illegal: The lawsuit argued that halving the department’s staff crippled its congressionally mandated functions, turning to the courts to defend agency capacity and separation of powers. (2025-03-13)</li>
<li>Federal judges William Alsup and James Bredar ordered reinstatement of tens of thousands of purged probationary federal employees: The injunctions found the DOGE-driven mass firings likely unlawful and forced agencies to offer jobs back, reinforcing legal protections for civil servants against politicized purges. (2025-03-13)</li>

<li>U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell temporarily blocked most of an executive order punishing law firm Perkins Coie: The ruling found the order resembled an unconstitutional bill of attainder, curbing the president’s attempt to single out a disfavored firm and protecting independent legal representation. (2025-03-12)</li>

</ol>
<h3>Economic Structure</h3>
<ol>

(2025-03-08)</li>

(2025-03-12)</li>
