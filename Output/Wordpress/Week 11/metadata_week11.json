Dim, directional light casts long shadows, evoking secrecy and strain on institutions. Painterly, realistic style, no text.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit panorama of Washington, D.C., with the Capitol and federal office blocks under a hazy, reddish sky. In the foreground, a large, partially transparent clock face overlays the scene, its gears exposed and subtly warped. Office windows are dark in shuttered agencies, while a few lit rooms glow in the White House and a distant data center. Protesters and suited officials appear as small silhouettes, scattered and out of sync, suggesting fragmented resistance amid an imposing, centralized state. Painterly, realistic style, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 11 of Trump\u2019s second term was less a single rupture than a saturation event. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:56 p.m., inching only 0.4 minutes deeper into danger, yet the underlying machinery shifted. Trump declared a national emergency to impose sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, centralizing trade and taxing power in the presidency while markets slid and favored sectors won exemptions. Simultaneously, mass layoffs and restructurings at HHS, EPA, USAID, and Social Security hollowed public health, environmental, and foreign aid capacity, with Elon Musk\u2019s extra\u2011legal DOGE shaping personnel and data access. Immigration and security tools were turned against activists, students, and migrants through arbitrary criteria and propaganda, even as courts sporadically intervened. Universities, museums, DC, and Maine were disciplined through funding and policing orders, while media and memory came under pressure via FCC probes, defamation suits, Smithsonian content edits, and sealed records. State attorneys general, judges, unions, and a 25\u2011hour Senate speech mounted resistance, but largely in reactive, fragmented fashion.",
