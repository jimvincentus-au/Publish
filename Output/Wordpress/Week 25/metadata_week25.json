The sky is heavy and smoky, with faint storm clouds, and government office windows are darkened as if emptied. Painterly, realistic style, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 25 of Trump\u2019s second term traced a coordinated tightening of power rather than a single rupture. The Supreme Court granted former presidents sweeping criminal immunity and curtailed nationwide injunctions, even as it cleared the way for mass federal layoffs and a State Department purge. Trump moved quickly into this space: ordering a strike on Iran without Congress, asserting sole authority over foreign relations, restricting lawmakers\u2019 access to classified information, and treating statutes and appropriations as optional in education funding and a TikTok ban. Inside the state, loyalty purges at the NSA and National Security Council, deep cuts at State, FEMA, NOAA, USAID, and health agencies, and RFK Jr.\u2019s capture of vaccine policy hollowed neutral capacity. Immigration became an authoritarian laboratory, with TPS terminations, third-country deportations, militarized raids, abusive detention, and dismantled DHS oversight. Law and information increasingly served as partisan weapons, while scattered court rulings and civil-society lawsuits struggled to keep pace. The Democracy Clock moved from 8:02 to 8:06 p.m., marking a sharp erosion of democratic safety.",
