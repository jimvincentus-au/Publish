\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 13 Appendix: Law as Instrument, Not Limit\
\
This week is a concentrated stress test of constitutional democracy, with the executive branch openly contesting judicial authority, weaponizing federal power against perceived enemies, and fusing policy with personal and partisan gain. The most acute structural pressure falls on the rule of law and separation of powers: the Abrego Garc\'eda and Alien Enemies Act cases show systematic defiance of court orders, attempts to evade contempt, and a theory of foreign-affairs immunity that would place deportations beyond judicial reach. Simultaneously, civil and political rights are narrowed through proof-of-citizenship voting rules, aggressive immigration enforcement against students and activists, and a coordinated anti-trans and anti-DEI campaign that uses funding threats against states and universities. Economic governance is destabilized by chaotic tariff policy and capital flight, while conflicts of interest proliferate around crypto deregulation and Trump-branded investment products. Information space and civic memory are reshaped via censorship in military schools, repurposing Covid.gov, attacks on public and private media, and closure of the State Department\'92s disinformation office. Courts, some states, and civil society mount significant resistance, but the week\'92s net effect is to normalize executive defiance and partisan control over core democratic infrastructure.\
