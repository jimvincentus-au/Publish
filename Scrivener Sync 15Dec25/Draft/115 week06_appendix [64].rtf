\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 6 Appendix: Credit Lines as Control Lines\
\
This week represents an acute acceleration of authoritarian consolidation across nearly every democratic safeguard. The executive further centralized power through Musk\'92s DOGE apparatus, mass-firing plans, and unilateral spending controls, while openly defying court orders on NIH funding and foreign aid. Law enforcement and intelligence were politicized via Kash Patel and Dan Bongino\'92s appointments, demands for FBI agent lists, and pardons plus impunity for January 6 actors. Civil service neutrality was gutted by reclassification orders, mass layoffs at NOAA, USAID, SSA, and Education, and explicit preparation for government-wide reductions in force. Simultaneously, the administration escalated attacks on marginalized groups\'97trans people, immigrants, refugees, and DEI programs\'97using law, visas, military policy, and detention practices. Press freedom and information integrity deteriorated sharply through AP bans, White House control of the press pool, selective Epstein-file releases, and AI-driven propaganda. Internationally, the U.S. aligned more closely with Russia, undermined Ukraine, and advanced a Gaza redevelopment scheme steeped in ethnic cleansing rhetoric. Courts and some states pushed back on data grabs, DEI bans, and refugee suspensions, but these checks were partial and often stayed. Structurally, this week entrenches crony capitalism, impunity for elite financial actors, and chaos as a governing method.\

Week 6 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. Attorney General Pam Bondi created a Justice Department weaponization working group reporting to the White House (2025-02-22): The attorney general formed a special unit to review alleged abuses of the criminal justice system that reports to a senior White House political aide, blurring the line between independent law enforcement and partisan direction.\
\
2. President Donald Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio and roughly 1,500 January 6 participants (2025-02-22): Mass pardons for those convicted in the Capitol attack removed legal consequences for political violence against the transfer of power, signaling impunity for loyalists who use force to contest elections.\
\
3. President Donald Trump expanded pardons to cover additional gun and drug charges for January 6 defendants (2025-02-24): By broadening pardons beyond political offenses to related criminal charges, the president further weakened deterrence for violent mobilization in support of his cause and undercut equal application of criminal law.\
\
4. President Donald Trump announced the largest deportation operation in American history (2025-02-22): The president\'92s pledge to carry out mass deportations framed migrants as an invasion, normalizing large-scale coercive population removal that threatens due process and equal protection for non\uc0\u8209 citizens.\
\
5. President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from women\'92s sports and threatened funding cuts to noncompliant states (2025-02-22): The order restricted participation of transgender athletes and was backed by threats to withhold federal funds, using centralized fiscal power to enforce contested social policy on states and schools.\
\
6.

\
7. President Donald Trump announced plans to sell U.S. citizenship through a multimillion\uc0\u8209 dollar gold card (2025-02-24): Proposing to grant residency and a path to citizenship in exchange for $5 million would formally tie legal status to wealth, deepening stratification in access to political membership.\
\
8.

\
9. President Donald Trump directed officials to negotiate Ukraine peace terms directly with Russia without Ukraine or European allies (2025-02-25): By sidelining Ukraine and European partners in war negotiations, the president concentrated foreign\uc0\u8209 policy decision\u8209 making in the executive and aligned outcomes with an adversary\'92s interests.\
\
10. President Donald Trump issued an executive order mandating healthcare price transparency (2025-02-25): The order required clearer disclosure of healthcare prices, using executive authority to increase market transparency and potentially strengthen patients\'92 ability to make informed choices.\
\
11.

\
12. President Donald Trump signed an executive order expanding the Department of Government Efficiency\'92s control over federal payments and spending reviews (2025-02-26): Centralizing oversight of contracts, grants, and loans under DOGE shifted practical power over appropriated funds from agencies and Congress toward a White House\uc0\u8209 aligned unit.\
\
13. President Donald Trump froze all government credit card spending for 30 days under DOGE authority (2025-02-26): The blanket freeze abruptly halted routine purchasing, including for NIH research, using emergency\uc0\u8209 style fiscal controls that bypassed normal budgeting and disrupted core public functions.\
\
14. President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to prepare for large\uc0\u8209 scale layoffs and reorganizations (2025-02-27): Administration\u8209 wide instructions to plan reductions in force positioned mass dismissals of civil servants as a central tool of executive policy, threatening bureaucratic continuity and neutrality.\
\
15. President Donald Trump announced deep budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (2025-02-28): Plans to cut roughly two\uc0\u8209 thirds of EPA\'92s budget would sharply reduce federal capacity to enforce environmental laws, shifting power toward regulated industries and state discretion.\
\
16.

\
17.

\
19. President Donald Trump ordered the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America by executive order (2025-02-24): Imposing a new official name for international waters and punishing entities that refused to use it asserted executive control over shared geographic language to enforce political symbolism.\

\
23. President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to plan reductions of hundreds of thousands of workers (2025-02-28): Requiring agencies to identify non\uc0\u8209 statutory functions and staff for potential elimination advanced a strategy of shrinking the permanent bureaucracy and expanding political control over what remains.\
\
24. President Donald Trump canceled a CDC immunization advisory meeting and an FDA flu\uc0\u8209 strain selection meeting (2025-02-28): Canceling key vaccine policy meetings during a severe flu season signaled political interference in routine public\u8209 health decision\u8209 making, potentially undermining evidence\u8209 based protection.\
\

\
28. President Donald Trump ordered the State Department to impose permanent visa bans on transgender athletes who misstate sex on applications (2025-02-25): Using visa policy to permanently exclude transgender athletes from entering the U.S. for competition weaponized border control against a specific marginalized group.\
\
29.

31. President Donald Trump ordered the end of New York City\'92s congestion pricing program via the Department of Transportation (2025-02-26): Rescinding prior federal approval for a local congestion\uc0\u8209 pricing scheme overrode state and city policy choices, asserting federal leverage over urban revenue and planning tools.\
\
32. President Donald Trump announced cuts to 875 Veterans Affairs contracts before partially rescinding them (2025-02-27): Attempted large contract cuts at VA, later walked back after backlash, showed how executive cost\uc0\u8209 cutting drives could abruptly threaten delivery of promised services to veterans.\
\
33. President Donald Trump announced elimination of hundreds of NOAA positions and broader climate\uc0\u8209 science cuts (2025-02-26): Targeting NOAA\'92s budget and staff, including diversity programs, weakened federal climate and weather capacity and signaled political hostility to inconvenient science.\

\
20.

Coalition of educators filed suit to block new anti\uc0\u8209 diversity civil\u8209 rights guidelines at the Department of Education (2025-02-28): Educators\'92 litigation against anti\u8209 DEI guidance sought to preserve inclusion practices in schools and constrain executive attempts to redefine civil\u8209 rights enforcement.\
\
24.

\
31.

\
Economic Structure\
\
1. Pentagon leadership announced layoffs of 5,400 civilian workers and a broader hiring freeze (2025-02-22): Cutting thousands of civilian defense jobs and freezing hiring reduced government employment and expertise in the largest federal agency, shifting capacity away from public service toward political cost\uc0\u8209 cutting goals.\
\
2. President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico (2025-02-22): New tariffs on major trading partners used trade barriers to pursue political and economic aims, risking higher consumer prices and retaliatory measures that could destabilize markets.\
\

4. Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida officials sued Target over Pride merchandise, alleging securities violations (2025-02-22): Using securities law to challenge corporate Pride marketing blended culture\uc0\u8209 war politics with investor\u8209 protection tools, pressuring firms over LGBTQ+ inclusion strategies.\
\
5. House Republican leadership advanced a budget framework with deep Medicaid and social spending cuts to fund large tax reductions (2025-02-25): The House budget prioritized trillions in tax cuts and enforcement spending over Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, embedding fiscal choices that favor wealthier interests and heighten inequality.\
\
6.

8. Elon Musk and DOGE oversaw mass firings of probationary workers at science agencies including CDC, NASA, and NOAA (2025-02-26): Targeted dismissals at key science agencies weakened long\uc0\u8209 term research and monitoring capacity, aligning federal expertise with a cost\u8209 cutting agenda driven by a private adviser.\
\
9. U.S. fossil fuel industry mounted campaigns against gas bans in new buildings (2025-02-24): Industry efforts to block local gas restrictions leveraged economic power to resist climate\uc0\u8209 oriented building codes, shaping policy outcomes in favor of fossil fuel interests.\
