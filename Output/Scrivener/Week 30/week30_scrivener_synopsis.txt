Week 30 of Trump’s second term turned Washington, D.C. into a laboratory for emergency rule. The White House declared a crime emergency in a city with falling violence, federalized the Metropolitan Police, and openly explored overturning Home Rule, only partially retreating under lawsuits and a congressional resolution. The same logic ran through immigration, where ICE targeted long‑settled residents, DACA recipients, and even alleged citizen children, while the Justice Department threatened sanctuary leaders and lawyers as new private detention centers and a Florida “deportation depot” expanded carceral profit. Security forces were repurposed: right‑wing extremism was deprioritized as Border Patrol agents appeared, rifles visible, at a Newsom event and the Pentagon was ordered to treat cartels like wartime enemies. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth advanced Christian nationalist and Lost Cause symbolism inside the military. Meanwhile, politicized appointments, mass firings, and privatization hollowed out statistical agencies, the CFPB, and veterans’ care. Courts and civil society won scattered victories, but the Democracy Clock’s slight internal shift captured a steady thinning of restraint.
