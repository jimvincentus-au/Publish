An American flag is partially visible, folded into the shadows. Painterly, realistic, high detail, no text, no real faces.",

In the foreground, a large, ornate clock reads just before 8 p.m. Long shadows from floodlights fall across rows of filing cabinets and server racks spilling out onto the National Mall, their cables snaking toward the White House. Protesters and judges appear as small, distant silhouettes at the edges, while towering stacks of executive orders and emergency decrees loom in the center. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 15 of Trump\u2019s second term was not marked by a single rupture but by the consolidation of a new normal. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:57 to 7:59 p.m., a 1.9\u2011minute shift that captured how emergency rule, executive fiat, and data\u2011driven administration became routine instruments of power. Paired national emergencies on the border and energy, Schedule F\u2011style purges, and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency pulled independent agencies and civil servants under direct White House control. Immigration and citizenship policy hardened into an ethnonational, quasi\u2011militarized regime, even as courts issued narrow injunctions and were attacked for doing so. At the Justice Department, prosecutions were redirected toward enemies while pardons and non\u2011enforcement shielded donors and January 6 offenders. Tariffs, fossil\u2011fuel expansion, and pay\u2011to\u2011play schemes shifted economic risk downward and profit upward. Simultaneously, public media, universities, and curricula were pressured or remade, and AI\u2011mediated rulemaking and mass data\u2011mining bids hinted at a quieter transformation of law and surveillance.",
