<h1>Week 34 Appendix: Military Governance as Routine</h1>
<p><em>National Guard deployments, paramilitary immigration raids, and curated memory deepen an order where opposition persists but carries rising personal and civic cost.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and security power, with immigration and urban crime used as pretexts for militarized federal interventions in Democratic-led jurisdictions. The Supreme Court’s shadow-docket greenlighting of racial profiling and expanded presidential control over independent agencies deepens structural erosion of the rule of law and judicial independence. Congress largely performs as an enabler—passing punitive immigration legislation, stripping DC’s budget, and lowering thresholds for confirmations—while declining to check unilateral strikes, foreign-aid rescissions, and sweeping tariff policies. Civil liberties are squeezed from multiple directions: ICE raids and National Guard deployments in cities, dismantling of a 40‑year White House peace vigil, politicized prosecutions and campus discipline after Kirk’s assassination, and coordinated campaigns to punish online dissent. At the same time, social and economic policy is reoriented toward ideological goals: Christian nationalist school measures, cuts to disability and minority-serving education, defunding science and reproductive health, and clawbacks of climate and solar programs. There are pockets of resistance—state-level social programs, court rulings protecting some civil servants and immigrant services, and large protests—but the net structural pressure strongly favors authoritarian drift across policing, courts, federalism, and information control.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Donald Trump signed an order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War: Renaming the Pentagon as the Department of War signaled a more aggressive military posture and used symbolic executive power to reframe the role of the armed forces in national life. (2025-09-06)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump approved a covert 2019 Navy SEAL mission in North Korea without briefing congressional leaders: Authorizing a lethal covert operation in North Korea without notifying the Gang of Eight bypassed statutory oversight of intelligence activities and concentrated war-making authority in the presidency.

<li>Trump administration launched &quot;Patriot 2.0&quot; and other ICE operations targeting immigrants released from custody: Rolling out named ICE crackdowns like &quot;Patriot 2.0&quot; against people released from custody framed immigration enforcement as quasi-military campaigns and intensified federal pressure on sanctuary jurisdictions. (2025-09-06)</li>

(2025-09-06)</li>
<li>Trump administration issued an order excluding certain immigrants from federal programs including Head Start: Redefining Head Start and other services to bar some immigrants from access used executive power to narrow the social safety net along status lines, deepening a tiered system of rights. (2025-09-09)</li>
