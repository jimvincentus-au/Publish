# Week 23 Appendix: Force as System of Rule

This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran without congressional authorization, followed by a Supreme Court decision sharply limiting nationwide injunctions. Together they expand executive freedom of action while constraining judicial remedies, directly intensifying traits 1 and 4 (unchecked executive power and law as weapon). Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is transformed into a sprawling, semi-militarized apparatus: masked agents, record detentions, new mega‑facilities, and plans to dismiss asylum claims and deport to third countries, all amid credible allegations of DOJ defiance of court orders. That cluster drives severe deterioration in rule of law, stratified citizenship, and security forces aligned with regime priorities. Information control and epistemic sabotage deepen: mass firings and defunding threats at Voice of America, politicized vaccine panels and anti‑science decisions, and systematic contradiction of U.S. intelligence on Iran. Courts and some state actors still resist—blocking parts of emergency declarations, ordering return of a deportee, protecting federal workers’ bargaining rights—but these are outweighed by structural moves that entrench authoritarian tools in war powers, immigration, public health governance, and the information sphere.

Power and Authority

1. President Donald Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate baseless 2020 election fraud claims (2025-06-21): Trump’s renewed demand for a special prosecutor into already-discredited 2020 fraud allegations kept a false narrative of a stolen election alive, undermining confidence in electoral outcomes and providing a pretext for restrictive voting measures.

2. President Donald Trump publicly dismissed U.S. intelligence assessments on Iran’s nuclear intentions (2025-06-21): By rejecting his own intelligence community’s finding that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon, Trump weakened expert-based national security decision-making and opened space to justify force on disputed or politicized intelligence.

3. President Donald Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate baseless 2020 election fraud claims (2025-06-21): Seeking a special prosecutor to re-litigate a settled election despite lack of evidence uses prosecutorial power to validate conspiracy narratives and erodes acceptance of legitimate electoral outcomes.
