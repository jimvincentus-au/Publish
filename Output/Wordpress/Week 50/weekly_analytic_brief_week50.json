  "summary": "This week shows an executive-centered system increasingly willing to use law, security forces, and cultural institutions as instruments of political power. Immigration enforcement is being industrialized and ideologized\u2014via denaturalization quotas, warehouse detention, and a $100m ICE recruitment blitz\u2014while courts intermittently push back, as in the TikTok streamer dismissal and the CFPB funding order. Trump\u2019s retaliatory vetoes of unanimously passed water and Everglades bills, and selective punishment of Colorado and tribal interests, exemplify federal power weaponized against disfavored regions. The Kennedy Center bylaw change and renaming, combined with background-check shortcuts for a border czar, highlight patronage and symbolic dominance over independent governance. Information manipulation is overt: censorship of investigative reporting, visa bans on anti-disinformation figures, and repeated presidential disinformation campaigns. Simultaneously, the Justice Department\u2019s opaque handling of Epstein files and massive but delayed document reviews deepen mistrust of elite accountability. State and civil society responses\u2014climate superfund laws, anti-gerrymandering marches, Block the Bombs advocacy\u2014signal pockets of democratic resistance, but the structural pressure this week runs heavily toward entrenching executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and chaotic, retaliatory governance.",

    "Militarized and industrialized immigration enforcement: denaturalization quotas, warehouse detention, and ideologically targeted ICE recruitment expand coercive capacity against immigrants and naturalized citizens.",
    "Retaliatory and selective use of federal power: vetoes of bipartisan water and Everglades bills, National Guard fights, and cultural institutions like the Kennedy Center used to punish or sideline opponents.",
    "Information control and disinformation from the top: censorship of investigations, visa bans on anti-disinformation actors, and repeated presidential lies weaponize confusion and erode shared factual baselines.",
    "Judicial pushback amid politicized courts: some rulings defend due process and agencies, but appellate decisions on Planned Parenthood and abortion prosecutions show courts increasingly aligned with ideological agendas.",
    "Civil society and subnational resistance: climate superfund laws, protests against gerrymandering and trans attacks, and artists\u2019 boycotts illustrate countervailing democratic energy outside federal institutions."
