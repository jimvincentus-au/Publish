Week 12 of Trump’s second term deepens existing grooves rather than cutting new ones. The Democracy Clock holds at 10:11 p.m., reflecting not safety but saturation: the traits of late-stage erosion are already near maximum. Law is wielded as a weapon, with executive orders punishing Susman Godfrey and coercing major firms into pro bono work for regime causes, while honest government lawyers are sidelined for admitting wrongful deportations. Courts win formal victories in cases like Abrego Garcia and Associated Press access, yet compliance is grudging and delayed. Immigration enforcement expands into schools, tax files, and social media, aided by IRS data-sharing and wartime statutes repurposed for deportations. Universities face funding freezes tied to speech and identity, and national memory is scrubbed through museum and Pentagon directives. Sweeping tariffs hand the president unilateral economic power, even as Congress gropes for limits. Protests, lawsuits, and scattered regulatory work persist, but within a narrowed, more punitive civic space.
