  "summary": "This week shows an acute convergence of authoritarian tools around immigration enforcement, foreign adventurism, and information control. The Minneapolis\u2013St Paul ICE surge, the killing of Renee Nicole Good, and subsequent shootings are the central axis: federal agents deployed at unprecedented scale, used lethal force, altered crime scenes, blocked state investigators, and were shielded by DOJ decisions and smear campaigns. That cluster drives heavy pressure on traits 4, 8, 9, 11, 41, 42, 43, 47, 50 and 53. Parallel moves\u2014threatening the Fed chair with criminal charges, politicized probes of lawmakers and whistleblower counsel, and the FBI raid on a Washington Post reporter\u2014extend the weaponization of law and security institutions (traits 1, 4, 6, 14, 18, 22, 23, 42). Internationally, the Venezuela operation, seizure of oil revenues, and open talk of invading or annexing Greenland, backed by tariffs and NATO-skeptical rhetoric, reveal an expansionist, transactional foreign policy that fuses crony capitalism with militarized leverage (traits 1, 10, 38, 40, 56). There is meaningful resistance\u2014state lawsuits, ACLU class actions, congressional field hearings, impeachment articles, and mass protests\u2014but these operate as reactive brakes against a rapidly consolidating executive-centered regime.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Immigration enforcement as a domestic war footing: ICE and DHS are used as quasi-military forces in blue jurisdictions, with mass raids, lethal force, and claims of federal immunity overriding local authority and civil rights.",
    "Law as a shield for allies and a sword for critics: DOJ and FBI actions repeatedly protect federal officers and political insiders while targeting journalists, academics, and lawmakers who challenge the administration.",
    "Crony extraction from foreign crises: The Venezuela intervention and control of oil revenues, plus Saudi mega-deals, show foreign policy and sanctions being leveraged for insider enrichment and geopolitical theater.",
    "Information environment captured and polarized: Selective leaks, smear campaigns, Pentagon press restrictions, Stars & Stripes takeover, and raids on reporters collectively narrow independent scrutiny of security and war policy.",
    "Normalization of emergency and militarized solutions: Threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, perfidy in overseas operations, private contractors in Venezuela, and Greenland invasion talk embed crisis logic into routine governance."
