  "summary": "This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with multiple branches and levels of government pulled into a coordinated project of centralizing power around the executive and its ideological program. The most intense pressures fell on rule-of-law structures, civil-military boundaries, and electoral integrity. Trump\u2019s blanket pardons for January 6 offenders, politicized prosecutions, and unlawful appointments, combined with the federalization and arming of D.C. police and National Guard, show law and security institutions being repurposed to protect the regime and punish opponents. Simultaneously, aggressive gerrymanders in Texas and retaliatory mid-decade redistricting in California, plus moves to end mail-in voting and tighten registration, push elections toward managed competition. Immigration and visa policy became a broad tool of ideological sorting and intimidation, while public-health and scientific agencies were attacked or captured to align data and policy with political narratives. There were pockets of resistance\u2014federal courts checking some excesses, civil servants and state officials suing or protesting\u2014but these functioned as defensive rear-guard actions against a rapidly expanding architecture of executive dominance and militarized domestic governance.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Militarization of domestic governance: Federalization of D.C. police, armed Guard patrols, JAG prosecutors, and Pentagon support for ICE embed military and security tools into routine urban and immigration policy.",
    "Rule of law as partisan weapon: Pardons for insurrectionists, politicized grand juries, retaliatory raids, and unlawful appointments show law used to shield allies and intimidate critics rather than constrain power.",
    "Engineered electoral advantage: Texas\u2019s mid-decade gerrymander, California\u2019s retaliatory maps, and Trump\u2019s push to end mail-in voting and tighten registration collectively move elections toward structurally biased contests.",
    "Immigration as ideological filter and fear instrument: Mass visa revocations, continuous vetting, social-media screening, expanded detention, and ICE branding turn legal status into a tool for sorting and disciplining disfavored communities.",
    "War on knowledge institutions and memory: Attacks on climate science, vaccines, economic statistics, Smithsonian exhibits, and professional societies aim to replace independent expertise and historical reckoning with loyal narratives."
