In Week 26 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been forming for months came into sharper relief rather than taking a new turn. The week did not bring a single spectacular rupture, but a dense layering of moves that pushed the state further toward loyalty rule, harsher stratification of rights, and managed information. Immigration enforcement hardened into a visible architecture of fear. The civil service was cut and reshaped to favor political reliability. Public media and data were thinned out, while private and security actors gained ground. At the same time, the fight over the Epstein files showed how elite impunity and conspiracy thinking can feed each other when institutions choose secrecy and retaliation over clean disclosure. The Democracy Clock held steady not because the week was calm, but because the damage it recorded was a deepening of lines already drawn.\
\
At the start of Week 26, the public-facing Democracy Clock stood at 8:06 p.m., already well into the evening of a troubled term. It ended the week at the same time, with no net change in minutes. The stillness of the hands does not mean nothing happened. It means that the week\'92s events, taken together, confirmed and thickened existing patterns rather than opening a new phase. Executive power continued to operate with scant effective oversight. Law was used more as a weapon than a limit. Surveillance of ordinary people expanded even as elite wrongdoing stayed partly in shadow. Civil service neutrality eroded further. Yet there were also pockets of resistance: judges blocking some refugee bans and TPS terminations, lawmakers of both parties demanding more transparency on Epstein, and thousands of citizens in the streets. Those counter-moves mattered, but they did not yet change the direction of travel.\
\
The most consequential structural development was the administration\'92s advance in politicizing the civil service and expert agencies. Early in the week, the State Department carried out mass layoffs, cutting more than 1,300 employees and closing the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. That bureau had been a symbol and instrument of U.S. support for liberal norms abroad. Its closure signaled that human rights work was no longer a priority, and that career diplomats associated with that mission were expendable. The same logic appeared at the Department of Education, where the administration sought to fire nearly half the workforce. When lower courts tried to block the layoffs, the Supreme Court stepped in with an emergency stay, allowing the cuts to proceed. In doing so, the Court did more than decide an employment dispute. It endorsed a reading of executive power that lets a president dismantle a department\'92s capacity even when Congress has funded it. That is a sharp turn away from stewardship.\
\
The week also saw the formal creation of Schedule G, a new classification for federal employees in policy-making roles. On paper, Schedule G was described as a way to fill a \'93gap\'94 in the excepted service and improve operations, especially at the Department of Veterans Affairs. In practice, it made it easier to hire and fire large numbers of policy staff on political grounds. Combined with the earlier purges, it turned swaths of the bureaucracy into something closer to a patronage system. At the VA itself, leadership banned LGBTQ+ pride flags, shut down an office investigating why Black veterans\'92 mental health claims were more often rejected, ended gender-affirming care for transgender veterans, and quietly removed anti-discrimination language from hospital bylaws. Those moves did not just change policy. They told staff and patients that certain identities and complaints no longer had institutional protection, and that the new loyalty test ran through culture-war lines.\
\
The Justice Department was pulled into the same pattern. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the department\'92s top ethics adviser, Joseph Tirrell, without explanation, and more than twenty other DOJ employees were also pushed out. Nearly two-thirds of the lawyers in the unit charged with defending Trump administration policies resigned, many saying they did not want to help dismantle constitutional structures. At the same time, the administration bypassed a judicial panel that had rejected John Sarcone III for an interim U.S. attorney post by appointing him instead as a \'93special attorney to the attorney general\'94 with the same powers and no time limit. The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Emil Bove\'92s nomination to a federal appeals court despite a whistleblower\'92s allegation that he had urged ignoring court orders, and despite a Democratic walkout. Taken together, these moves showed how prosecutorial and judicial roles were being filled and emptied on the basis of loyalty and usefulness rather than neutral competence. The guardrails inside law enforcement and the courts grew thinner.\
\
The second major development was the consolidation of a harsh, surveillance-heavy immigration regime that treated non-citizens\'97and sometimes citizens\'97as people with fewer rights. The administration moved to end bond hearings for immigrants who entered without legal status, shifting release decisions from judges to DHS officials and making detention the default. ICE Director Todd Lyons issued a memo allowing deportations to third countries with as little as six hours\'92 notice, often without firm assurances against persecution or torture. A separate policy change made undocumented immigrants ineligible for bond hearings while they challenged deportation, affecting millions. These were not emergency measures tied to a specific crisis. They were rules designed to normalize a rights-poor zone around immigration enforcement.\
\
On the ground, those rules were enforced with visible force. ICE raids at licensed cannabis farms in California used tear gas and less-lethal ammunition, injuring workers and protesters. A 57-year-old farm worker, Jaime Alan\'eds, died after falling from a greenhouse roof while trying to hide. Hundreds were arrested, including a disabled veteran and a university professor who was later charged with assaulting an officer. In Los Angeles, ICE used Terminal Island as a staging ground for workplace raids that swept up nearly 2,800 people in two weeks, a place whose history of Japanese American incarceration gave the images a deeper resonance. In Oregon, agents broke a car window and arrested Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, an Iranian father, outside his child\'92s preschool, the first confirmed immigration arrest at a school in that state after the administration loosened rules on \'93sensitive locations.\'94 An Irish tourist who overstayed his visa by three days due to a medical issue was held for about 100 days in various detention facilities, including a federal prison, before being deported and banned for ten years. These were not isolated excesses. They were the visible edge of a system that treated some lives as disposable.\
\
Behind these scenes, the data infrastructure of enforcement thickened. ProPublica reported that the IRS was developing a system to share confidential tax data, including home addresses, with ICE for deportation targeting, despite earlier legal objections from the agency\'92s own counsel. The administration also reached an agreement to give ICE access to Medicaid data on roughly 79 million recipients, including addresses and Social Security numbers, under the stated aim of preventing fraud. Career civil servants had warned that such sharing might violate statutes and chill people from seeking care. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed earlier in the month, poured more than $6 billion into border surveillance technology: biometric towers, license plate readers, phone hacking tools, and expanded social media monitoring. These contracts enriched firms like Palantir and Anduril and embedded private actors in the core of state coercive power. The result was a system in which masked ICE agents, sometimes without clear identification, could move through communities backed by vast data flows from health and tax systems that had not been built for this purpose. Surveillance of ordinary people grew denser even as elite crimes stayed opaque.\
\
Courts and civil society did not stand entirely aside. A federal judge in Los Angeles temporarily blocked ICE raids that relied on racial profiling, insisting on reasonable suspicion standards. Another court granted a temporary restraining order to keep an Ohio imam, Ayman Soliman, from being transferred out of state before his bond hearing. A federal appeals court paused the administration\'92s attempt to end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 12,000 Afghans, and a separate judge blocked the use of a presidential proclamation to bar 80 vetted refugees from entering the country. A class-action suit was filed in Washington, D.C., challenging courthouse arrests of immigrants and their advocates as violations of due process and the Fifth Amendment. Representative Pramila Jayapal announced plans for legislation to bar ICE from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens, after reports that citizens had been swept up in raids. These actions showed that parts of the judiciary and legislature were still willing to contest the new enforcement architecture. But they were reactive and piecemeal, while the administration\'92s program was broad and coordinated.\
\
A third development lay in the way law and institutions were bent to protect allies and punish opponents. Attorney General Bondi directed the DOJ to drop charges mid-trial against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, accused of destroying COVID vaccines and issuing fake vaccination cards, framing him as someone who had given patients \'93a choice.\'94 At the same time, the department sought only a one-day sentence for Brett Hankison, the former officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor\'92s civil rights by firing into her bedroom during a botched raid, and a state court in Pennsylvania sentenced another officer to probation for killing a bystander outside a Walmart. These lenient responses to law enforcement and anti-vaccine actors contrasted sharply with the severity of immigration enforcement and with the treatment of lower-status offenders. Law was not being applied with one standard.\
\
The pattern extended into politics. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened to arrest Democratic legislators who boycotted a special session on redistricting, a tactic long used by both parties to deny quorums. President Trump openly called for a \'93simple redraw\'94 of the Texas congressional map to gain five more Republican seats and suggested similar moves in other states. Texas Republicans moved ahead with plans for mid-decade redistricting that would weaken the influence of the state\'92s growing nonwhite population. In Florida, the state supreme court upheld a congressional map that dismantled a Black-influence district and split it into four majority-white districts, rejecting challenges under the state\'92s Fair Districts Amendment. In North Carolina, the Republican-controlled elections board voted to require additional ID data from voters, a change that could purge nearly 100,000 people from the rolls or force them into provisional ballots that might not be counted. Each of these steps was justified in the language of legality and integrity. Taken together, they entrenched a system in which some voters\'92 voices counted less by design.\
\
The fourth major development was the coordinated weakening of public goods in information and foreign engagement, and the parallel strengthening of crony networks. Congress and the administration moved in tandem to cut $9 billion in previously approved spending, including $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and about $8 billion for foreign aid. A rescissions package, first advanced by the White House and then passed by both chambers, retroactively blessed unilateral executive clawbacks and reoriented federal priorities away from public broadcasting and international assistance. A separate bill in the Senate sought to cut $9 billion from public broadcasting and foreign aid, preserving only $400 million for the PEPFAR HIV/AIDS program after pushback. The U.S. Agency for Global Media was largely dismantled, ending many U.S.-backed international broadcasting efforts. These moves did not silence all independent voices, but they thinned out the noncommercial, public-facing parts of the information system and left more space for private and partisan outlets. Independent media was starved while state-aligned and market-aligned outlets thrived.\
\
At the same time, the administration and its allies used civil courts as tools against critical media. Trump filed a libel and slander suit seeking at least $10 billion against Rupert Murdoch, the Wall Street Journal, and its reporters over a story about a lewd letter and sketch allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. He also sued Dow Jones, News Corp, and others over coverage of a \'93bawdy\'94 letter. Representative Randy Fine announced plans to end the House\'92s subscription to the Wall Street Journal after its Epstein reporting. On the other side of the aisle, California Governor Gavin Newsom filed a $787 million defamation suit against Fox News and host Jesse Watters over a misreported phone call, even after an on-air apology. These suits differed in their factual bases and political aims, but they shared a reliance on massive damage claims that could chill investigative reporting and commentary. The Trump presidential library, meanwhile, stood to receive up to $63 million from settlements in Trump\'92s lawsuits against Meta, ABC, Twitter, and Paramount, blurring the line between personal legal strategy, media intimidation, and institutional funding. Wealth was buying not just speech, but law.\
\
Economic and regulatory policy also tilted toward favored interests. The administration lifted export controls on chip design software and certain AI chips to China, allowing companies like Nvidia and AMD to resume profitable sales despite earlier strategic concerns. It cut $4 billion in federal funding for California\'92s high-speed rail project, a long-standing target of Trump\'92s criticism, undermining both climate goals and a rival state\'92s infrastructure plans. The IRS moved to terminate its free Direct File tax tool after meeting with tax software lobbyists, pushing taxpayers back toward private products. HUD planned to terminate seven major investigations into housing discrimination and segregation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics suffered deep cuts that forced it to estimate a much larger share of prices, degrading the quality of inflation data. Each decision could be defended on narrow grounds\'97efficiency, deregulation, budget discipline. Together, they showed how policy and public resources were being steered toward corporate and political allies, while the informational and regulatory capacities that serve the broader public were thinned. Crony capitalism and curated economic data became part of the governing toolkit.\
\
Threaded through all of this was the Epstein files saga, which became a kind of mirror for the system\'92s handling of elite wrongdoing and public distrust. The DOJ and FBI issued a memo concluding that Epstein had died by suicide and that no incriminating client list existed, and they announced that no further disclosures would be made. That decision angered not only Trump\'92s critics but also parts of his base, who had long been promised a reckoning with \'93elites.\'94 MAGA influencers called for Bondi\'92s firing. Elon Musk used his platform to ask why the files had not been released. Dan Bongino, now deputy FBI director, was drawn into the controversy. House Democrats introduced resolutions and amendments to force release of the files, only to see them blocked in the Rules Committee. House Republicans twice voted down Democratic attempts to mandate disclosure within 30 days, even as Speaker Mike Johnson publicly urged the DOJ to release more documents and explain itself. Senator Dick Durbin wrote to DOJ and FBI seeking details on the assignment of 1,000 agents to the case. Senator Ron Wyden pressed for access to bank reports on Epstein\'92s financial network. Pressure came from many directions.\
\
Inside the Justice Department, the response to this pressure was not a clean opening of the record but a mix of limited concessions and hard-edged retaliation. Bondi defended her handling of the case and suggested that some files had been created by political opponents. The department asked the Supreme Court to reject Ghislaine Maxwell\'92s appeal, reinforcing her conviction, but it also fired Maurene Comey, a prosecutor who had worked on Epstein and Maxwell, without clear cause. Comey was the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump had long blamed for the Russia investigation. Her dismissal, communicated in a letter citing the president\'92s Article II powers, was widely read as political payback. Later in the week, DOJ filed motions to unseal Epstein grand jury transcripts with redactions for personal information, and Trump himself ordered Bondi to release grand jury testimony under pressure from his supporters. At the same time, Wired reported that nearly three minutes were missing from the \'93full raw\'94 surveillance video of Epstein\'92s cell. The net effect was not clarity but more confusion: partial transparency, selective firings, and lingering gaps in the record. Memory was being curated, not fully shared.\
\
While these national dramas played out, other institutions showed both strain and resilience. The Election Assistance Commission announced a public meeting of its technical committee to discuss updated voting system guidelines and invited comment on financial reporting forms, even as it canceled two open meetings later in the month. The National Archives sought public input on proposed records schedules, keeping a channel open for citizens to weigh in on what should be preserved or destroyed. In Louisiana, a lookback law allowing clergy abuse victims to sue regardless of when the abuse occurred survived a church challenge, and the New Orleans archdiocese filed a settlement plan that included a public archive of files on credibly accused clergy. In Baltimore, a suite of community-based programs\'97Safe Streets, the Group Violence Reduction Strategy, summer youth engagement, and school-based interventions\'97continued to show measurable reductions in shootings and youth victimization, offering a different model of public safety rooted in support rather than coercion. These were small but real acts of stewardship.\
\
Civil society also asserted itself in more direct political ways. Over 1,500 protests took place across the country under the banner \'93Good Trouble Lives On,\'94 honoring the legacy of John Lewis and calling for voting rights, justice, and dignity. The grassroots group Indivisible ran online trainings to prepare people for organizing and protest. Polling showed that 79 percent of American adults viewed immigration as beneficial and 85 percent supported pathways to citizenship for undocumented people brought as children, a stark contrast with the administration\'92s enforcement agenda. These signals did not yet translate into policy change, but they showed that public opinion and civic energy were not fully aligned with the direction of federal power. The moral floor was sagging, but it had not collapsed.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 26, several processes were already in motion that would shape the next chapters. The Texas special session on redistricting, called under Trump\'92s urging and backed by threats from the state attorney general, was set to test how far a state could go in mid-decade map-drawing and how courts would respond. California\'92s governor had floated ways to counter that move, raising the prospect of a broader redistricting arms race. The rescissions package cutting public broadcasting and foreign aid had cleared both chambers and awaited the president\'92s signature, which would lock in a new spending baseline. The Supreme Court\'92s stay on Education Department layoffs had already taken effect, but the underlying case about executive power over the civil service remained live. Lawsuits challenging courthouse arrests, FEMA grant cuts, and the \'93Alligator Alcatraz\'94 detention facility were in early stages, with potential to clarify or narrow the administration\'92s reach. And the partial unsealing of Epstein grand jury materials, if carried through, would test whether limited transparency could restore any trust in institutions that had chosen secrecy and retaliation for so long.\
\
In the larger arc of the term, Week 26 matters less for any single headline than for the way it shows a system settling into a new normal. Executive power over personnel and policy is now exercised with little effective oversight, and the courts, at their highest level, have often chosen to enable that reach rather than restrain it. Immigration enforcement has become a proving ground for a broader model of governance that accepts permanent emergency, pervasive surveillance, and stratified citizenship. Public goods in information, education, and foreign engagement are being pared back, while private and security actors close to power gain contracts, influence, and legal leverage. The fight over the Epstein files, with its mix of secrecy, partial disclosure, and personal vendettas, illustrates how elite impunity and public distrust can reinforce each other when institutions abandon the discipline of full, even-handed truth-telling.\
\
Yet the week also records that resistance has not vanished. Judges still issue orders that protect refugees and TPS holders. Lawmakers from both parties sometimes demand more transparency than the executive is willing to give. Cities like Baltimore experiment with non-carceral ways to reduce violence. Citizens march in the thousands to defend voting rights and civil rights. These are not yet enough to move the Democracy Clock back toward safety, but they are the sources from which any future repair would have to grow. At the close of Week 26, the official time remains 8:06 p.m. The hands do not move, but the weight behind them increases, as the structures of a more illiberal order become harder to unwind and the costs of inaction rise for those who still care about the morning that clock was built to measure.\
