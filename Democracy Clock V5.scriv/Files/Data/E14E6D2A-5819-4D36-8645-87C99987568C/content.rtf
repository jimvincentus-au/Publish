Week 38 unfolded as a week of pressure rather than rupture, a week in which the machinery of government was bent harder toward partisan ends without yet snapping outright. The pattern is not a single coup-like event, but many smaller moves that together deepen the sense that law, force, and information are being turned into tools of rule rather than limits on it. At the same time, courts, governors, and civil society actors continued to push back, sometimes successfully. The result is a landscape of contest, with the executive branch testing how far it can go and other institutions scrambling to draw lines after the fact. That contest is real. It is also uneven.\
\
At the start of Week 38, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:08 p.m., already well into the danger hours. It ends the week at the same public time, 8:08 p.m., though the underlying measure nudged forward by a tenth of a minute. That tiny movement captures the week\'92s character. There was no single shock large enough to move the hands in a visible jump, but there was a steady accretion of risk: more normalization of emergency powers, more evidence that the Justice Department serves the president\'92s enemies-and-allies list, more use of the shutdown as a weapon. The modest shift reflects that these trends were partly offset by judicial orders blocking troop deployments, by state lawsuits, and by public letters from former officials. Power moved, but it met resistance.\
\
The most visible struggle of the week played out over the use of military and quasi-military force inside the United States. The administration pressed ahead with a strategy of deploying National Guard units and federal agents into Democratic-led cities under the banners of crime control and immigration enforcement. President Trump authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members to Chicago to protect federal facilities, and the Defense Department federalized 200 Texas Guard soldiers and 300 from Illinois for the same mission. These moves followed earlier efforts to send Oregon\'92s own Guard to Portland and, when blocked, to bring in Guard units from California and Texas instead. The pattern was clear. When one legal door closed, the White House looked for another.\
\
Courts and states did not accept this passively. In Oregon, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued and then expanded orders blocking Guard deployments to Portland, first halting the federalization of Oregon\'92s own Guard and then barring troops from California and Texas as well. She found that the administration\'92s claims of a city \'93burning to the ground\'94 were not supported by facts and warned against blurring the line between civil and military power. Her rulings were echoed by a federal judge in Illinois, April Perry, who at first declined to immediately block Guard deployments to Chicago but later issued a two-week halt, citing a lack of credible evidence of rebellion. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Governor J.B. Pritzker filed lawsuits arguing that the deployments were unconstitutional and part of a \'93war\'94 on their state. These suits framed the issue as one of federalism as much as public order. That framing will matter going forward.\
\
The executive branch, for its part, treated these legal setbacks as obstacles to be worked around rather than as final limits. After Immergut\'92s initial order, the administration sent 300 California Guard troops toward Portland anyway, prompting an emergency hearing and a 14-day prohibition on any federalized troops entering Oregon. A federal appeals court later paused part of Immergut\'92s order by allowing federalization of Oregon Guard members while keeping a ban on their deployment to Portland. In Chicago, Texas Guard troops were deployed to the region even as litigation proceeded. The administration\'92s rhetoric matched its actions. White House officials led by Stephen Miller discussed invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops more broadly, and Miller publicly asserted that the president had \'93plenary authority\'94 to use the military to suppress insurrections. The message was that legal constraints were negotiable. That message was heard.\
\
On the streets, these legal battles translated into a heavier federal footprint. In Portland, federal officers escalated their use of tear gas and other crowd-control measures against protesters just hours after Immergut\'92s ruling against Guard deployments. In Chicago\'92s suburb of Broadview, ICE agents used tear gas, pepper balls, and physical force against protesters and journalists outside a detention facility, with viral videos showing agents striking local officials and media workers. In another incident, agents pepper-sprayed a protester in a frog costume by spraying into the costume\'92s air intake, turning a symbol of humor into a target. A Chicago apartment raid described as \'93unforgivable\'94 fit the same pattern of aggressive tactics against civilians in the name of immigration enforcement. The line between policing and intimidation grew thinner.\
\
Judges again stepped in to draw lines around this use of force. In northern Illinois, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction limiting federal agents\'92 use of pepper balls, rubber bullets, and physical force against protesters and journalists who did not pose a serious threat, and requiring agents to wear visible identification. She then granted a two-week temporary restraining order barring federal agents from arresting or using physical force against journalists without probable cause. These orders did not dismantle the enforcement apparatus, but they imposed procedural guardrails that had been missing. They also signaled that at least some federal judges were willing to treat the treatment of protesters and the press as a matter of constitutional law, not mere operational discretion. That signal cut against the administration\'92s claims of unchecked authority.\
\
The militarization of domestic politics was not confined to Guard deployments and riot gear. A classified Justice Department memo came to light that justified lethal strikes against suspected drug trafficking boats by arguing that the president could designate traffickers as enemy combatants. This legal theory underpinned a strike on a boat off Venezuela ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and framed as part of an \'93armed conflict\'94 with cartels. The New York City Bar Association condemned these actions as illegal summary executions that violated U.S. and international law and called on Congress to remind the president of his lack of authority to conduct such operations. In a separate incident, Trump reportedly ordered a strike on a Colombian boat, mistaking it for a Venezuelan one, leading Colombia\'92s president to claim that Colombian citizens had been killed. The White House dismissed the claim as baseless, but U.S. officials privately acknowledged the likelihood that the boat was Colombian. The combination of expansive legal claims and factual sloppiness widened the gap between formal war powers doctrine and actual practice. That gap is dangerous.\
\
The Justice Department sat at the center of a second major development: the transformation of law from a limit on power into a weapon of the state. Over the course of the week, the department moved against several figures who had crossed Trump in the past, while closing or weakening investigations into allies. Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding, after years of public calls by Trump to prosecute him. Comey pleaded not guilty and his lawyers signaled plans to argue that the case was a vindictive and selective prosecution. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who had previously brought a civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, was indicted by a federal grand jury on bank fraud and false statement charges related to a Virginia mortgage. The indictment was presented by Lindsey Halligan, a newly appointed U.S. attorney and former personal lawyer to Trump, after her predecessor resigned rather than pursue the case. The signal to other prosecutors was clear.\
\
These prosecutions did not arise in a vacuum. Career prosecutors in Virginia, including Elizabeth Yusi, had previously concluded that there was no probable cause to charge James and had planned to decline the case. A criminal referral had come from Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a Trump ally, who himself was accused of violating ethics procedures by making such referrals directly rather than through his inspector general. Trump had publicly attacked James as \'93SCUM\'94 and demanded her removal. When the indictment finally came, Democrats in New York and Washington denounced it as a weaponization of the Justice Department. The sequence\'97presidential pressure, career resistance, leadership change, and then indictment\'97illustrated how personnel decisions can be used to align prosecutorial outcomes with political desires. It also showed how thin the line is between legal process and political payback.\
\
At the same time, the department moved in the opposite direction when it came to allies. Allegations that border czar Tom Homan had accepted a $50,000 bribe in exchange for immigration enforcement contracts were effectively buried. A recording of the alleged bribe existed, according to whistleblowers, but the investigation was dropped after Trump took office. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the closure by saying a thorough review found no credible evidence of wrongdoing. In court, DOJ lawyers argued that Trump\'92s pardons of January 6 defendants conferred immunity for unrelated crimes, further insulating allies. When Democracy Forward sued the FBI and DOJ under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the Homan recording, the suit underscored how transparency laws were now needed to pry loose information about potential corruption that the department itself declined to pursue. The law was not blind. It was aimed.\
\
Bondi\'92s own conduct became a focal point in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Senators pressed her on why she had disbanded the FBI\'92s Foreign Influence Task Force and the national cryptocurrency enforcement team, fired or transferred 139 immigration judges\'97many with high asylum grant rates\'97and stripped the Public Integrity Section of much of its staff and authority, including its role in approving charges against members of Congress. They questioned her about her past work as a registered foreign agent for Qatar and her role in approving Trump\'92s solicitation of a free jet from the Qatari royal family. Bondi refused to answer many of these questions, including those about the Epstein client list and who had ordered FBI agents to flag records mentioning Trump in the Epstein files. Her silence, combined with selective releases of records from Jack Smith\'92s investigation into Trump\'92s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, painted a picture of a department that disclosed when it helped the president and stonewalled when it did not. That picture is now hard to ignore.\
\
The Epstein files themselves became a symbol of how transparency can be managed to protect elites. A Republican-controlled House kept the chamber in recess during the shutdown and refused to swear in Adelita Grijalva, a newly elected Democrat from Arizona whose vote would have been the 218th signature on a petition to force a vote on releasing the files. Speaker Mike Johnson cited logistical reasons, even though other members had been sworn in during pro forma sessions. Formerly fringe figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene broke with their own party to criticize the delay, suggesting that the move was about blocking transparency rather than procedure. Outside Congress, a whistleblower alleged that FBI agents had been told to flag any Epstein records that mentioned Trump, and Attorney General Bondi\'92s refusal to explain who gave that order deepened suspicion. Democracy Forward\'92s FOIA suit over the Homan tape, and another suit seeking Epstein-related records, showed civil society trying to use the courts to pry open what elected branches were determined to keep closed. The fight over archives became a fight over accountability itself.\
\
The shutdown itself formed a third major strand of the week\'92s story. Rather than treating the lapse in funding as a crisis to be resolved quickly, the administration and House leadership used it as an opportunity to reshape the state. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced that the shutdown would be used to implement $26 billion in cuts to infrastructure and climate projects in Democratic-led states and to lay off federal employees. OMB issued and then quietly revised guidance suggesting that furloughed workers might not be guaranteed back pay, despite a 2019 law that had been understood to provide such guarantees. Trump publicly suggested that not all furloughed employees should receive back pay, hinting at a selective approach based on perceived merit or loyalty. The shutdown became leverage, not just lapse.\
\
These moves hit federal workers and the public unevenly. The shutdown produced staffing shortages at airports, with air traffic controllers and security screeners working without pay, causing delays and raising safety concerns. At the same time, most ICE offices remained open, while the Office of Detention Oversight\'97the unit that inspects detention facilities\'97was largely furloughed. This meant that enforcement continued while oversight paused. OMB\'92s reinterpretation of back-pay rules, combined with threats to cut the federal workforce and targeted cancellations of energy and transportation projects in Chicago, New York, and other Democratic-governed areas, turned the shutdown into a tool for punishing disfavored regions and atomizing the civil service. Public hardship was treated less as a problem to solve than as a means to an end.\
\
Congress did little to counter this strategy. The Senate repeatedly failed to pass competing bills to end the shutdown, with neither Republican nor Democratic proposals gaining enough bipartisan support. Democrats insisted on pairing any funding deal with extensions of Affordable Care Act tax credits and reversals of Medicaid cuts, while Republicans pushed a short-term extension without such provisions. The House remained in recess, functioning more as a stage for blame than as a forum for negotiation. Meanwhile, Democrats introduced a bill to reimburse childcare costs for federal workers during the shutdown, a small attempt to cushion the blow for families caught in the crossfire. The overall effect was to normalize the idea that basic government operations and workers\'92 livelihoods are bargaining chips in partisan standoffs. That normalization is itself a form of damage.\
\
Beneath these headline struggles, the civil service and security agencies were being reshaped in quieter ways. The FBI fired at least two special agents involved in investigations into Trump, including one close to retirement, and reassigned nearly half of the agents in its 25 largest field offices to immigration enforcement. DHS reassigned hundreds of national security specialists to immigration tasks, with employees told they could lose their jobs if they refused. The ICE Office of Detention Oversight was furloughed while detention operations continued. At the CIA, the deputy director demoted the acting general counsel and assumed the role himself, a move legal ethics experts called \'93bizarre.\'94 Together, these actions eroded the neutral, professional character of the bureaucracy and concentrated authority in politically aligned hands. The machinery of state was being retuned.\
\
The week also saw a tightening of control over information and memory. The White House altered the process for selecting reporters in the press corps, raising concerns that access would be steered toward friendly outlets. Trump attacked media figures like Rev. Al Sharpton and NBC\'92s owner, suggesting that NBC\'92s license should be reviewed, and he expanded efforts to crack down on Pentagon leaks, with the Pentagon Press Association condemning new restrictions on reporters as intimidation. The Pentagon investigated nearly 300 employees over online comments critical of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, blurring the line between personal speech and professional conduct. In Chicago and Portland, journalists covering protests were hit with tear gas and pepper spray, prompting lawsuits and the restraining orders issued by Judge Ellis. The space for independent reporting narrowed.\
\
At the same time, the administration pushed disinformation and fringe science from the top. Trump repeated a debunked claim that he had warned about Osama bin Laden before 9/11, and he delivered a partisan speech to Navy personnel asserting that the 2016 election had been rigged against him. In a Cabinet meeting, he again claimed that vaccines cause autism, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged ongoing studies to \'93prove\'94 a connection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed the universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation and called for separate MMR vaccines despite a measles outbreak, while announcing a review of the childhood immunization schedule under RFK Jr.-appointed officials. Six former surgeons general from both parties issued a public letter condemning Kennedy\'92s mismanagement and misinformation as a threat to public health. Their intervention underscored how scientific institutions were being pulled into the same struggle over truth and authority. Facts themselves were under siege.\
\
The administration also moved to shape national memory more directly. Trump announced that the second Monday in October would henceforth be recognized as Columbus Day, establishing it as a national holiday and aligning the calendar with a particular narrative of discovery and conquest. The Treasury Department advanced plans to mint a dollar coin featuring Trump\'92s face, despite laws barring living presidents from appearing on currency. In Oregon, the Republican Party used a fabricated image of unrest, stitched together from South American scenes, to justify Guard deployments to Portland, only to see a judge block the deployment and call out the lack of factual basis. These actions, taken together, showed how symbols, holidays, and even doctored images can be used to reinforce a story of the nation that centers the leader and marginalizes dissenting histories. Memory was being curated from above.\
\
Civil society and subnational governments did not stand still in the face of these trends. In addition to the lawsuits over Guard deployments and protest brutality, a coalition of 282 former Justice Department officials issued a letter warning that the administration was undermining DOJ integrity by violating court orders and dismantling anti-corruption units. Governors Pritzker and Newsom threatened to leave the National Governors Association if it did not address federal troop deployments, and Oklahoma\'92s Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, publicly criticized the deployment of Texas Guard troops to Illinois, marking a rare intra-party rebuke on federalism grounds. In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed executive orders prohibiting ICE from using city-owned property as staging areas, asserting local control over federal operations. Protesters shut down Michigan Avenue in a large, peaceful march, and organizers planned a \'93No Kings\'94 protest for the following week, even as House Republicans labeled it terrorism and a \'93Hate America rally.\'94 Resistance remained visible, if outgunned.\
\
Abroad, the administration\'92s approach to power and law showed similar patterns. Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas to accept his Gaza peace plan by a fixed deadline, then announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase, including hostage releases and military withdrawal. The U.S. prepared to send 200 troops to Israel to support the ceasefire. At the same time, Trump halted diplomatic outreach with Venezuela and leaned into military options, while ordering the strike on the Colombian boat. The administration announced a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina\'92s central bank three weeks before its midterm elections, raising questions about U.S. influence on foreign democratic processes. It also agreed to allow Qatar to establish an air force base at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho, training Qatari pilots over U.S. airspace, even as Attorney General Bondi\'92s past work as a Qatari agent and Trump\'92s personal business ties to Qatar cast a shadow over the decision. The same themes\'97personal ties, opaque deals, and military leverage\'97ran through foreign policy as well.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 38, several scheduled or pending decisions loomed over the democratic landscape. The Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in Bost v. Illinois on mail-in ballots, Chiles v. Salazar on Colorado\'92s conversion therapy ban, and Louisiana v. Callais on the Voting Rights Act\'92s Section 2, with outcomes that could reshape voting rules, LGBTQ+ protections, and minority representation. Later in the term, the Court would hear cases on Trump\'92s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and on the president\'92s power to remove Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, with implications for trade policy and central bank independence. In Chicago, federal courts were preparing to rule on the legality of Guard deployments and the scope of federal agents\'92 authority, while Letitia James and James Comey were scheduled to appear in court to contest what they called politically motivated charges. The government shutdown showed no sign of imminent resolution, and OMB\'92s reinterpretation of back-pay rules left federal workers uncertain about their financial futures. The docket ahead is heavy.\
\
In this context, the Democracy Clock\'92s slight movement within the same visible minute takes on a particular meaning. Week 38 did not bring a new doctrine that openly abolished elections or dissolved Congress. Instead, it showed how a presidency can use existing tools\'97emergency powers, prosecutorial discretion, budget execution, and control over information\'97to erode the moral floor of democracy without formally changing the rules. Law was used more openly as a weapon against opponents and as a shield for allies. Federal power was directed more sharply against disfavored states and cities. The civil service was bent further toward loyalty tests and immigration enforcement. Protest and press freedoms were squeezed by force on the ground and by rules in Washington. At the same time, judges, governors, former officials, and protesters asserted that there were still lines that could not be crossed without a fight. Those lines are under strain.\
\
The official end-of-period time remains 8:08 p.m. That constancy should not be mistaken for safety. It reflects a week in which authoritarian practices deepened along paths already laid down, rather than leaping into a new phase. The moral floor analysis for the week describes the direction of movement as collapsing, with character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship all under serious strain. Yet the same analysis notes sources of resilience: judicial pushback, active civil society, and a historical commitment to democratic norms that has not yet been extinguished. Week 38 matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly those sources can be overwhelmed if they are not reinforced, and how easily law, force, and memory can be turned from public goods into instruments of rule. The clock\'92s hands may look still, but the ground beneath them is shifting.\
