This move is part of a broader restructuring plan to shift scientific expertise to program offices focused on major issues like air and water. The changes are expected to save the EPA nearly $750 million. The decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that allows the downsizing of the federal workforce, which will reduce EPA staffing by over 3,700 employees. Critics warn that these actions will have severe impacts on public health and the environment.",
