In Week 9, the pattern that had been building since the start of the term came into sharp relief. The presidency no longer moved mainly through rhetoric or isolated orders, but through a dense web of actions that treated law as a tool to be bent, agencies as assets to be stripped or repurposed, and independent institutions as obstacles to be disciplined. Immigration, education, media, and the civil service were all pulled into this project. The week\'92s events did not yet amount to a formal break with constitutional government, but they showed how far a determined executive could go while the formal text of the Constitution remained unchanged. The center of gravity shifted from rules to will.\
\
At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:33 p.m. It now reads 7:34 p.m., a movement of 1.4 minutes deeper into the evening. That small numerical change masks a heavy turn in substance. The clock moved because executive power was asserted against courts and Congress in ways that were structural, not symbolic; because law was used less as a limit and more as a weapon; because universities and media were brought under open political pressure; and because the civil service and social protection systems were hollowed out or handed to private allies. Courts and state attorneys general pushed back in many cases, but the balance of power tilted further toward a presidency that acts first and dares other institutions to catch up. That is the new baseline.\
\
The clearest expression of that shift came in the administration\'92s use of the Alien Enemies Act and related authorities. The president invoked an eighteenth\uc0\u8209 century wartime statute to arrest and deport noncitizens he labeled as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, even though the United States is not at war with Venezuela. Over two hundred men were flown to El Salvador and consigned to a \'93terrorism confinement\'94 prison, with the United States paying for their incarceration. Tattoos and vague associations were treated as proof of gang membership. Many deportees had no criminal record at all. When Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order halting these deportations and ordering planes to return, the administration let the flights continue and then argued that his authority stopped at the edge of U.S. airspace. Law, in this account, was not a boundary but a script to be rewritten mid\u8209 performance. That is a profound change.\
\
This defiance did not occur in isolation. The administration also deported a Brown University medical professor, Rasha Alawieh, despite a judge\'92s order requiring 48 hours\'92 notice before removal. It deported a Venezuelan makeup artist and LGBTQ asylum seeker to a Salvadoran maximum\uc0\u8209 security prison based on misread religious tattoos. It detained a Canadian woman with a valid work visa for two weeks in harsh conditions, and a German permanent resident was stripped naked and interrogated at the border. Chinese immigrants faced intensified raids and charter flights home, even in sanctuary cities. In each case, the pattern was the same. Immigration law was stretched or ignored to remove people who were vulnerable, foreign, or politically inconvenient. Due process became optional.\
\
At the same time, the presidency moved to redefine who counts as part of the polity. The Department of Homeland Security announced that it would revoke temporary legal status for more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, ending a Biden\uc0\u8209 era parole program that had allowed them to live and work in the United States. The change, signed by the new homeland security chief, would take effect within weeks, exposing hundreds of thousands to deportation unless they could find another legal foothold. In parallel, ICE intensified operations against Chinese immigrants, and the administration used an obscure foreign\u8209 policy deportation provision to arrest Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former Columbia student, on the theory that his presence had adverse foreign\u8209 policy consequences. Citizenship and lawful presence were no longer stable statuses. They were contingent on alignment with the regime\'92s priorities.\
\
Universities, long treated as semi\uc0\u8209 autonomous spaces of debate and research, were brought under direct federal pressure. Columbia University saw $400 million in federal contracts and grants clawed back, with the administration demanding a mask ban, the winding down of certain departments, and greater powers for campus police as conditions for restoring funds. The University of Pennsylvania had $175 million in funding frozen over its policies on transgender athletes. A new taskforce was announced to investigate alleged antisemitism at ten major universities, and letters went to sixty more warning of investigations and possible enforcement. At the same time, immigration authorities arrested or targeted international students and scholars who had led or joined pro\u8209 Palestinian protests: Mahmoud Khalil was detained and moved between jurisdictions; Georgetown\'92s Badar Khan Suri was arrested and accused of Hamas ties; a Cornell PhD student, Momodou Taal, was asked to surrender to immigration authorities days after he sued to block deportation orders. The message was plain. Federal money and immigration status would be used to discipline campuses that tolerated dissent.\
\
The administration\'92s treatment of education went further than pressure on individual institutions. On March 20 and 21, the president signed a series of executive orders directing the dismantling of the Department of Education itself. One order, framed as \'93Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities,\'94 instructed the secretary to take steps to close the department and return authority to states and localities. Another, described as dismantling the department, proposed cutting programs for students with disabilities and English learners, ending Pell Grants and federal aid for low\uc0\u8209 income students, and shifting student loan management to the Small Business Administration. A companion order suggested overhauling or eliminating FEMA, pushing disaster relief to the states. These moves challenged the basic settlement that Congress, not the president, creates and abolishes cabinet departments. They also threatened the federal role in enforcing civil\u8209 rights protections and equal access in education. The stakes were national.\
\
The student loan system became a test case for this new order. The Department of Education had already removed online applications for income\uc0\u8209 driven repayment plans from its website, citing litigation over the Biden\u8209 era SAVE plan. The American Federation of Teachers sued, arguing that the department was unlawfully shutting down access to congressionally mandated repayment options. Then the White House announced that the Small Business Administration would take over the federal student loan portfolio, while the Department of Health and Human Services would handle education services for students with disabilities. Experts warned that the SBA lacked the infrastructure and mission to manage tens of millions of loans. The effect was to turn a social protection program into a business product, administered by an agency designed to serve lenders and entrepreneurs, not borrowers in distress. That is a structural shift.\
\
The same logic of administrative sabotage appeared at the Social Security Administration. An internal memo, later confirmed by public statements, outlined a new policy requiring most new claimants to verify their identity either online or in person at a field office. For elderly and disabled people without reliable internet access, that meant traveling to offices already strained by staffing cuts and closures. Another internal message revealed a freeze on the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, which had automatically issued Social Security numbers to newly authorized workers and naturalized citizens. The freeze, not publicly announced, would force an additional 60,000 to 75,000 people each week into SSA offices. Judges later described the Department of Government Efficiency\'92s attempt to mine SSA data as a \'93fishing expedition\'94 and ordered any personal information it had obtained destroyed. But the damage to service capacity, and to trust, was already underway. People felt it at the counter.\
\
Across the administrative state, agencies were redirected away from neutral regulation toward the interests of political and corporate allies. The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to roll back or eliminate thirty\uc0\u8209 one major pollution rules, including limits on emissions from cars and power plants and protections for clean water. These rules had been projected to save nearly 200,000 lives by reducing air and water pollution. The EPA justified the changes as cost\u8209 cutting, but independent analyses showed that the health benefits far outweighed compliance costs. At the same time, reports surfaced that the agency planned to gut its Office of Research and Development, potentially firing over a thousand scientists. The Department of Justice removed eleven guidance documents on disability rights and ADA compliance from its website, including materials on masking and Covid\u8209 19, calling them \'93unnecessary and outdated.\'94 The Department of Agriculture cut inspection teams for plant and food imports, increasing the risk of invasive pests and unsafe products. In each case, the formal rules of law remained, but the capacity and will to enforce them were eroded.\
\
Private actors moved into the space opened by this retreat. Erik Prince lobbied for a $25 billion plan to privatize the mass deportation of twelve million migrants, positioning contractors to profit from a coercive state function. Elon Musk\'92s Starlink service was installed across the White House campus as a \'93donation,\'94 with a DOGE employee handling the work and the Secret Service scrambling to respond to an uncoordinated security event. Musk\'92s companies secured a major contract to manage U.S. airspace after the Federal Aviation Administration canceled a $2.4 billion agreement with Verizon, prompting Democratic senators to call for corruption investigations. The Department of Government Efficiency, closely tied to Musk, gained broad access to unclassified federal records and systems under a new executive order, until courts stepped in. Musk was scheduled to receive a Pentagon briefing on war plans for a potential conflict with China, a plan later walked back after press reports. The president himself acknowledged that Musk\'92s business ties to China created a conflict of interest. Yet the briefing went forward in some form, and Musk received a private session at the Pentagon on March 21. The line between contractor and strategist blurred.\
\
The media landscape was reshaped in parallel. The president signed an order eliminating the U.S. Agency for Global Media, parent of Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia. Over 1,300 VOA employees were locked out of their building and placed on administrative leave. Contracts with major wire services were canceled. A Washington Post column described the move as silencing an 83\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old system of independent journalism that had reached 360 million listeners worldwide. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty sued, arguing that the termination of its funding violated the Constitution and federal law. At home, the White House restricted Associated Press access to the Oval Office and Air Force One because the AP refused to adopt the term \'93Gulf of America\'94 instead of \'93Gulf of Mexico.\'94 A federal judge declined to restore access, at least for now. The administration also used a popular song, \'93Closing Time,\'94 without permission in a deportation video, prompting the band to protest that their work had been turned into a tool of state messaging. Independent media were not banned outright, but they were starved of resources and access, while state\u8209 aligned narratives were amplified.\
\
Courts did not stand idle in the face of these moves. Judge Boasberg\'92s restraining orders on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, his demand that planes be turned around, and his later order requiring the government to explain its noncompliance were clear assertions that even wartime statutes have limits. Judge Theodore Chuang\'92s ruling that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the Constitution, and his order to restore parts of the agency, reaffirmed Congress\'92s authority over the creation and closure of federal agencies. Other judges blocked the administration from clawing back $20 billion in EPA climate grants, halted a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, and barred DOGE from accessing Social Security data. Democratic state attorneys general filed roughly ten lawsuits against administration policies, winning temporary restraining orders in nearly all of them and holding community impact hearings to document harms. In these venues, the rule of law still had teeth.\
\
Yet the executive branch treated many of these rulings as obstacles to be worked around rather than commands to be obeyed. The Department of Justice argued that Judge Boasberg\'92s verbal order to recall deportation flights was not binding because it was not in writing, and that his jurisdiction ended once planes left U.S. airspace. It asked an appeals court to remove him from the case. The president called Boasberg a \'93Radical Left Lunatic\'94 and demanded his impeachment. A Republican congressman from Texas filed articles of impeachment against the judge. The White House press secretary misrepresented his order and attacked his wife for her political donations. MAGA supporters issued bomb threats against judges who ruled against the administration, including a Supreme Court justice. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke, stating that impeachment is not a remedy for disagreement with judicial decisions. But the pattern was set. Courts could still issue orders; whether those orders would be followed was another matter.\
\
The same pattern of attack and partial resistance appeared in the treatment of whistleblowers and internal critics. Johnathan Buma, a veteran FBI agent who had raised concerns about political bias in the bureau, was arrested at JFK airport and charged with illegally disclosing classified information and drafting a book manuscript that drew on internal files. Elon Musk, angered by leaks about his planned Pentagon briefing, called for the prosecution of insiders who had spoken to the press. Together, these actions signaled that those who exposed or even discussed sensitive dealings between the administration and powerful private actors could face criminal sanction. The formal protections for whistleblowers remained on the books, but the practical risk of coming forward increased. That risk was widely understood.\
\
Civil society responded in uneven ways. Environmental groups faced a chilling signal when a North Dakota jury ordered Greenpeace to pay more than $660 million in a defamation case tied to Dakota Access pipeline protests, a verdict that observers warned would embolden other companies to sue activists. At the same time, a women\'92s advocacy group launched a campaign to extradite Andrew Tate to face charges abroad, and Representative Jasmine Crockett helped organize nationwide nonviolent protests at Tesla dealerships, urging people to sell their cars and stock. Democratic attorneys general held public hearings to gather testimony from those harmed by federal policies, building a record for court and history. These efforts showed that organized resistance still had channels, but they also revealed the risks of confronting a state that increasingly framed dissent as disorder or terrorism.\
\
Internationally, the administration continued to reposition the United States away from traditional alliances and toward a narrower conception of interest. The Pentagon, under Secretary Pete Hegseth, froze intelligence and weapons packages for Ukraine, causing anxiety among Ukrainian forces and allies. The administration withdrew from an international body investigating responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine and terminated a contract that had helped track Russian abductions of Ukrainian children. The president held calls with Vladimir Putin about a ceasefire that, according to Russian accounts, hinged on ending U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Reports emerged that the administration was considering giving up the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe in NATO. At the same time, the United States refused, for the first time, a Mexican request for water under a 1944 treaty, citing Mexico\'92s shortfalls. These moves signaled a retreat from cooperative frameworks that had underpinned democratic alliances for decades.\
\
Within the military and security apparatus, the line between public defense and regime preservation grew thinner. The closure of the Pentagon\'92s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response office and the Civilian Protection Center of Excellence removed institutional advocates for minimizing civilian casualties. The removal of a Black four\uc0\u8209 star general and a female four\u8209 star admiral from senior posts, along with the elimination of DEI programs, narrowed the leadership profile of the armed forces. The Air Force\'92s decision to strip training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots from its curriculum, later partially reversed after public outcry, showed how history itself could be edited to fit a new narrative. Plans for a militarized buffer zone along the New Mexico border, staffed by active\u8209 duty troops with authority to detain migrants, raised fresh questions about the Posse Comitatus Act and the use of the military in domestic enforcement. In Yemen, U.S. airstrikes ordered without congressional authorization killed dozens of civilians, including children, under a doctrine of \'93overwhelming lethal force.\'94\
\
Looking ahead from this week, several processes were already in motion that would test the remaining strength of democratic checks. Judge Boasberg set a deadline for the government to explain its failure to comply with his deportation orders, raising the question of whether courts could meaningfully sanction executive officials who defied them. Lawsuits by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the American Federation of Teachers, and Democratic attorneys general would determine whether the shutdown of media outlets, the dismantling of the Department of Education, and the \'93pause\'94 in federal grants could be reversed or slowed. Appeals of the Greenpeace verdict would show whether civil courts would become a regular venue for crushing protest movements through financial penalties. And the reorganization of student loans under the SBA, along with new Social Security identity rules, would either be normalized or challenged as deliberate sabotage of social protection.\
\
By the end of Week 9, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'977:34 p.m.\'97captured a landscape in which formal institutions still functioned but their ability to constrain power had been weakened. Executive orders reached into the structure of agencies that Congress had created. Courts issued rulings that were mocked, evaded, or met with impeachment threats. Universities, media outlets, and cultural institutions were told that their funding and even their physical premises depended on compliance with the administration\'92s cultural line. Immigration law, wartime statutes, and terrorism rhetoric were repurposed to mark out who belonged and who could be removed, detained, or silenced. At the same time, judges, state officials, unions, and advocates continued to use the tools available to them to resist, document, and slow these changes. The contest was still live.\
\
This week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly a democracy can move from contest over policy to contest over the very terms of law and belonging. The shift is not announced in a single speech or decree. It appears instead in the accumulation of acts: a deportation flight that ignores a court order; a department ordered closed by executive fiat; a broadcaster silenced; a judge called a lunatic from the White House podium; a student told that protest may cost him his visa. Each act on its own might be explained away. Taken together, they mark a regime that treats constraints as problems to be solved, not principles to be honored. That is why the clock moved, and why the time at the end of Week 9\'977:34 p.m.\'97deserves to be remembered.\
