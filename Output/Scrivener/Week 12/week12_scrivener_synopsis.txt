Week 12 of Trump’s second term registered as a near‑static moment on the Democracy Clock, but the machinery behind the dial shifted. The presidency leaned on emergency economic powers to launch and then partially pause a global tariff war, jolting markets and inviting foreign retaliation while Congress struggled to reclaim authority. Immigration enforcement hardened into a data‑driven deportation regime: TPS holders, students, lawful residents, and even citizens were swept into an apparatus powered by IRS records, Palantir‑linked databases, and social‑media surveillance. Universities, law firms, nonprofits, and cultural institutions faced funding freezes, consent decrees, and targeted investigations that tied their survival to political compliance. Courts alternated between deference and resistance, greenlighting mass firings and Alien Enemies Act deportations even as they ordered the return of a wrongfully removed resident and restored press access. Voting rules tightened under the banner of integrity, public history and science were scrubbed, and the civil service was hollowed out or privatized. The net effect was consolidation without spectacle: emergency as normal governance.
