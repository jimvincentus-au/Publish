\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 37: Shutdown as Quiet Purge\
A nearly motionless clock masks a week in which shutdown brinkmanship, militarized enforcement, and deepfakes quietly rewired power, rights, and public memory.\
The week did not break with a single shock. It unfolded as a series of moves that, taken together, showed a government more willing to use every lever at hand\'97money, law, force, and story\'97to reward loyalty, punish resistance, and thin out the neutral ground where democracy usually lives. What changed was not the formal map of institutions, but the way power moved through them: who stayed, who left, who was paid, who was targeted, and whose version of events was allowed to stand. The pattern was steady, not sudden.\
At the close of Week 36, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:08 p.m. At the end of Week 37, it remained at 8:08 p.m., a net shift of 0.1 minutes. The public time did not move, but the underlying pattern did. The week deepened the use of the shutdown as a weapon, widened the reach of militarized politics, and hardened a tiered system of rights and safety. Courts, unions, and some state actors pushed back in places, but their efforts slowed rather than reversed the drift. The apparent stillness of the clock masked a further erosion of restraint, truthfulness, and stewardship.\
The most visible change came inside the federal workforce itself. The administration\'92s Deferred Resignation Program, already in motion, produced the departure of more than 100,000 federal employees in a matter of days. These were not routine retirements. Workers were told to resign now or face later firing under uncertain terms. The result was a hollowing out of agencies\'92 memory and capacity, especially among those least willing to serve under direct political pressure. What remained was a thinner, more cautious civil service.\
At the same time, the White House ordered agencies to prepare for large-scale firings tied to the funding lapse. Planning documents framed the cuts as a response to budget shortfalls, but the context made clear that the shutdown was also an opportunity. In internal memos, the administration acknowledged that a prolonged closure would cause large GDP and job losses, yet the president publicly described the moment as a chance to make \'93irreversible\'94 cuts to medical and social programs. The message to public workers and beneficiaries alike was that their security could be traded away in a fiscal standoff. That message landed.\
Unions tried to draw a line. Federal labor organizations sued to block the mass firings, arguing that the Deferred Resignation Program and layoff plans violated civil-service protections and collective-bargaining rights. Their lawsuits underscored that the fight was not only about paychecks but about whether the executive could unilaterally reshape the bureaucracy under cover of a shutdown. Even as these cases moved forward, the damage was already done: tens of thousands of experienced staff were gone, and those who remained had fresh reason to fear that their jobs depended on political compliance. Fear became a management tool.\
The same week, the administration used the budget crisis to redraw the map of federal investment. The Office of Management and Budget canceled nearly $8 billion in climate and clean-energy funding, much of it in Democratic-led states, and froze billions more in infrastructure money for New York City and Chicago. A $2.1 billion transit grant for Chicago was halted under the banner of opposing race-conscious contracting. Tunnel and transit projects in New York were similarly stalled. These decisions were framed as technical reviews or civil-rights concerns, but their pattern was clear: jurisdictions that resisted the president\'92s agenda saw their long-term projects put at risk.\
Shutdown mechanics also became a tool for obscuring the consequences of these choices. The government allowed the funding lapse to delay the monthly jobs report and other key economic data, depriving the public and markets of timely information about the labor market. An internal White House memo estimated steep economic losses from a prolonged shutdown, yet the administration pressed on. At the same time, a large bailout for Argentina continued uninterrupted, insulated from the domestic freeze. Foreign commitments and politically important farm bailouts moved forward, while climate projects, transit upgrades, and homelessness programs at home were cut or stalled. The priorities were unmistakable.\
Oversight and information channels narrowed in parallel. The Federal Election Commission canceled several open meetings while proceeding with a closed one, reducing public visibility into campaign-finance enforcement. The administration withdrew a controversial nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after bipartisan concern, averting one overt politicization of economic data, but then used the shutdown itself to halt the flow of statistics. Federal agencies, from Housing to Education, turned their websites and email systems into partisan billboards, inserting blame for the shutdown into automatic out-of-office replies. Voice of America, the government\'92s international broadcaster, was suspended and its journalists furloughed, even after a court had ordered hundreds of them reinstated. The shutdown thus served not only to starve programs and staff, but to reshape who could speak and what the public could see.\
If the shutdown was one front, immigration was another. The administration fired more than 100 immigration judges and replaced them with 600 military lawyers, many lacking the usual qualifications for such roles. This was not a marginal adjustment. Immigration courts are where the state decides who may stay, who must leave, and on what terms. By purging experienced judges and importing officers from the military justice system, the White House shifted a key adjudicative arena toward a culture of command and loyalty. The move dovetailed with a broader shift in Justice Department priorities away from drug trafficking and money laundering and toward immigration prosecutions. The system\'92s center of gravity moved.\
On the ground, that shift translated into harsher outcomes for people with the least leverage. Long-settled Southeast Asian refugees with old convictions were deported, despite decades of residence and the United States\'92 own role in the conflicts that had brought them here. Dozens of Iranians were removed under a bilateral deal, even as rights groups warned about conditions in the receiving country. The administration moved to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelan and Haitian nationals; the Supreme Court granted an emergency stay that allowed the policy to proceed while legal challenges continued, exposing thousands to the risk of removal before their claims were fully heard. Protection became more fragile.\
Conditions in detention underscored the human cost of these choices. At the Dilley family facility, run by a private contractor, court filings described poor treatment and prolonged confinement of parents and children. Elsewhere, aggressive raids and warrantless arrests swept up U.S. citizens alongside noncitizens, leading to lawsuits and settlements. A Justice Department rule conditioned victim aid for sexual assault and domestic violence on immediate proof of immigration status, prompting a coalition of twenty states to sue, warning that survivors would be deterred from seeking help. In each case, immigration enforcement logic bled into social services and public safety, making access to protection contingent on legal status.\
Courts and states pushed back at the margins, but the overall direction favored enforcement. The Justice Department sued Minnesota over its sanctuary policies, challenging local efforts to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. A federal court held that immigration stops could be based partly on race so long as citizens were released once they proved their status, weakening equal-protection norms. In the high-profile case of Kilmar \'c1brego Garc\'eda, a Salvadoran asylum seeker publicly vilified as a gang member without convictions, immigration courts applied strict filing deadlines to deny reopening his claim, while other federal judges, in separate cases, ruled that deporting pro-Palestinian scholars for their speech violated the First Amendment. The result was a patchwork: some rulings defended speech and process, but the system as a whole tilted toward speed, suspicion, and removal.\
Alongside these legal shifts, the president and his team recast domestic politics in the language of war. In a speech at Quantico, Trump urged the use of combat troops in U.S. cities to confront what he called an \'93invasion from within,\'94 and warned generals that they could be dismissed if they did not comply with his directives. He then ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy federal troops to Portland over state and local objections, treating protest and crime in a single city as a national security problem. The administration declared an armed conflict with drug cartels and labeled them terrorist organizations, expanding war powers into what had long been a law-enforcement domain.\
Abroad, the president announced plans for military strikes against alleged traffickers inside Venezuela, again without clear congressional authorization. At home, he signed an executive order designating Antifa\'97a loosely defined protest tendency\'97as a major terrorist organization. He also ordered broad investigations of activists and nonprofits labeled as linked to domestic terrorism. These steps blurred the line between external enemies and internal opponents. Tools built for foreign battlefields\'97terrorist designations, war rhetoric, and the promise of combat troops\'97were turned inward toward cities, protesters, and civil society groups.\
Chicago became a vivid example of how this war framing played out on the ground. Under the banner of Operation Midway Blitz, heavily armed ICE teams carried out a large-scale immigration crackdown in a city neighborhood. A multi-agency nighttime raid on an apartment building left residents, including children, restrained outside for hours. When protesters tried to block government vehicles and oppose the raids, federal agents used tear gas and pepper balls to clear the streets. The tactics resembled a counterinsurgency operation more than routine law enforcement. The city felt occupied, not served.\
Economic pressure accompanied the show of force. The same week, the administration froze $2.1 billion in transit funding for Chicago, citing concerns over race-based contracting. The halt threatened long-planned upgrades to the city\'92s transportation system and sent a message to local leaders: resistance to federal priorities could carry a price in both safety and infrastructure. The deportation of Mario Guevara, a long-resident journalist arrested while covering protests and later removed to El Salvador after charges were dismissed, added another layer. It signaled that documenting these operations could itself become grounds for expulsion.\
Chicago was not alone. The Justice Department\'92s FACE Act lawsuit against pro-Palestinian activists who disrupted a synagogue event, and the aggressive prosecution of pregnancy-related offenses across states, showed how statutes originally designed to protect access and safety could be repurposed to punish certain kinds of protest and behavior. Together with the \'c1brego Garc\'eda case and the deportations of refugees and Iranians, these actions turned immigration and protest spaces into laboratories for a harsher, more politicized form of governance. The experiments were already underway.\
Inside the legal system, the week\'92s pattern was one of selective pressure and uneven resistance. The firing of acting U.S. attorney Michele Beckwith after she insisted that Border Patrol agents obey a court order sent a clear signal: prosecutors who enforced judicial rulings against executive preferences could lose their jobs. The New York City Bar Association\'92s public criticism of the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as politically motivated underscored broader concern that prosecutorial power was being used to settle scores. At the same time, the administration pursued a FACE Act case against synagogue protesters and oversaw a surge in pregnancy-related criminal prosecutions, including homicide charges, in the wake of Roe\'92s reversal. Laws meant to protect clinics and life were being used to criminalize dissent and women\'92s conduct.\
Courts did not simply acquiesce. A federal judge held that Trump\'92s acting U.S. attorney in Nevada was not validly serving, enforcing statutory limits on temporary appointments. Other courts blocked the administration\'92s attempt to reallocate FEMA disaster funds away from twelve Democratic states, issuing sharp rebukes of its legal reasoning and reinforcing that emergency money could not be used as a blunt political weapon. The Supreme Court allowed Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in office while it reviewed Trump\'92s effort to remove her, temporarily protecting central bank independence. The Federal Trade Commission, in a unanimous vote, brought an antitrust case against Zillow and Redfin over an advertising deal, signaling that some competition enforcement continued.\
Yet these pockets of resistance sat alongside decisions that widened executive discretion and stratified rights. The Supreme Court\'92s emergency stay on TPS terminations favored the administration\'92s timeline over the security of vulnerable communities. A federal court\'92s acceptance of racial profiling in immigration stops, so long as citizens could later secure release, normalized discriminatory enforcement. The Justice Department refused to release further Epstein investigation files even as House Democrats published new batches of estate documents, keeping key parts of elite misconduct in the dark. Defense Secretary Hegseth announced an overhaul of the Pentagon Inspector General\'92s office and records policies while under investigation, raising fears that internal watchdogs were being reshaped to blunt scrutiny. The National Archives\'92 acting inspector general opened an inquiry into the release of Representative Mikie Sherrill\'92s largely unredacted military records, probing whether archives themselves were being used as tools against political opponents.\
Behind and around these institutional moves ran a dense stream of manipulated information. The president posted and then deleted an AI-generated message promising fictional \'93medbed\'94 hospitals for all Americans, blurring the line between official policy and conspiracy fantasy. He spread false claims that hundreds of FBI agents had acted as agitators on January 6, contradicting established investigations and casting doubt on the legitimacy of accountability for the Capitol attack. He shared unverified medical advice about Tylenol and vaccination schedules, and the White House communications office issued a press release misrepresenting studies to claim that Tylenol use in pregnancy causes autism. These messages did not just mislead; they came from the highest levels of government, making it harder for citizens to know which guidance to trust.\
The White House also embraced synthetic media as a political weapon. Racist AI-generated deepfake videos depicting Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries making fabricated statements were shared and replayed in official spaces. Other AI content was woven into narratives about healthcare and immigration. At the same time, agencies used their own channels to push partisan blame for the shutdown. HUD, the VA, Education, and others sent emails and posted notices that assigned responsibility to Democrats. Education officials went further, altering furloughed employees\'92 automatic replies to carry political messaging, effectively conscripting civil servants\'92 personal communications into a coordinated propaganda effort.\
Independent and critical voices faced new constraints. Voice of America\'92s broadcasts were suspended during the shutdown, shortly after a court had reinstated hundreds of its employees, suggesting that funding tools could be used to sidestep judicial protections for journalism. Apple removed ICE-tracking apps from its store after administration pressure, limiting digital tools that communities used to monitor enforcement. A class action challenged the administration\'92s aggregation of personal data across federal agencies, alleging violations of privacy and voting rights and raising fears that centralized information systems could be turned toward surveillance or electoral manipulation. Within the Department of Energy, leaders instructed staff to avoid terms like \'93climate change\'94 and \'93decarbonization,\'94 narrowing the language experts could use to describe their work and, by extension, what the public could hear.\
Narrative control extended into culture, education, and history. Defense Secretary Hegseth decided to retain the Medals of Honor awarded to soldiers involved in the Wounded Knee Massacre and publicly praised their \'93bravery.\'94 In doing so, he reinforced a version of national history that glorifies violent conquest over Indigenous peoples and treats a massacre as a moment of honor. Northwestern University blocked hundreds of students from registering for classes unless they completed an antisemitism training video produced outside the institution and criticized as biased, raising questions about compelled speech and the use of administrative power to enforce contested narratives.\
Harvard University faced federal threats of debarment and public claims of a large settlement and trade-school deal, as the administration used funding eligibility and public messaging to shape the university\'92s role and image. The Department of Energy\'92s climate-language ban further constrained what could be said in official settings. At the same time, the president ordered the declassification of all government records on Amelia Earhart, a historic mystery, just as new Epstein estate documents were being released by Congress. The timing suggested that archival releases could be used not only for transparency but also as diversion, drawing public attention away from contemporary scandals toward a safer, more distant intrigue.\
These cultural and informational moves intersected with ongoing fights over rights. Federal enforcement actions targeted Minnesota\'92s policy allowing trans girls in sports, using civil-rights channels to restrict gender-identity protections. Policies that had led to more than 400 pregnancy-related criminal prosecutions since Roe\'92s reversal continued to reshape the legal landscape for women and pregnant people. Justice Clarence Thomas signaled a willingness to revisit precedents on church\'96state separation and same-sex marriage, hinting at possible future rollbacks of rights previously secured. Against this backdrop, Utah\'92s Republican governor, Spencer Cox, publicly called for an end to political violence after high-profile attacks, a reminder that not all actors in the president\'92s party embraced the escalation.\
Taken together, the week\'92s developments showed a government leaning more heavily on chaos as a method. Shutdown brinkmanship, mass resignations, troop deployments, foreign strikes, deepfakes, and archival diversions unfolded at once, creating overlapping crises and distractions. Each move could be defended in isolation as a response to budget constraints, crime, foreign threats, or campus conflict. In sequence, they made it harder for any single abuse to hold public attention long enough to be checked. Oversight bodies were not abolished, but they were strained, bypassed, or repurposed. Rights were not formally repealed, but their exercise became more costly and uneven.\
The Democracy Clock\'92s near-stillness in Week 37 reflects this paradox. On the surface, there was no single constitutional rupture. Elections still loomed, courts still issued rulings, Congress still met. Yet the moral floor continued to sink. Character gave way to loyalty tests; ethics blurred as public resources and private interests intertwined; restraint eroded under the pressure of war rhetoric and shutdown leverage; truthfulness faltered amid deepfakes and pseudoscience; good faith receded as procedures were bent to defeat their own purpose; stewardship suffered as watchdogs were weakened and the civil service was thinned. The week did not close a chapter. It deepened a pattern in which power advanced quietly, through the very systems meant to contain it.\
