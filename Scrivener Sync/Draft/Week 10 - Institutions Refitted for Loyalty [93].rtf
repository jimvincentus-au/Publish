By Week 10 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been emerging since inauguration came into sharper focus. Power was not only being gathered; it was being refitted for a different purpose. Institutions that once mediated between the public and the presidency were pressed into service as instruments of loyalty, punishment, and narrative control. The week\'92s events did not announce a single break with the past so much as they showed how many separate systems could be bent at once. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 8:48 p.m., moved forward to 8:54 p.m. That six\uc0\u8209 minute shift marks a period in which the tools of a constitutional state were used more openly to sort citizens by worth, to narrow who may vote, work, or study, and to rewrite the story the country tells about itself.\
\
The previous week had closed with the clock at 8:48 p.m., already well into the evening hours of democratic risk. By the end of Week 10, it read 8:54 p.m., a net move of 5.9 minutes toward midnight. The change came from several converging lines. New executive orders reached into elections, labor rights, and the civil service, often without meaningful oversight. Law was used less as a limit on power and more as a weapon against law firms, universities, and migrants who stood in the way. Emergency authorities, especially the Alien Enemies Act, were treated as a standing migration tool rather than a rare wartime measure. Universities and museums were pressed to align their teaching and exhibits with a state\uc0\u8209 approved story. And the status of noncitizens, students, and workers was sorted more explicitly by ideology and heritage. Courts, state officials, and civil society did push back in places, but the net effect was to deepen the structural tilt toward executive dominance and elite capture.\
\
The most far\uc0\u8209 reaching development of the week was the attempt to redraw the boundaries of the electorate by executive order. On March 25, Trump signed a series of orders that required documentary proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, threatened to cut funding to states that did not comply, and sought to bar the counting of mail ballots received after Election Day. One order gave the Department of Government Efficiency access to state voter lists, opening the door to large\u8209 scale purges under the banner of \'93integrity.\'94 These moves did not come through Congress, which the Constitution charges with setting many of the rules for federal elections. They came from the White House, backed by rhetoric about noncitizen voting that lacked factual support. In practice, such rules fall hardest on naturalized citizens, low\u8209 income voters, and those without ready access to passports or birth certificates. The trait the Clock tracks as \'93voter suppression rationalized as election integrity\'94 jumped sharply, because the orders were not symbolic gestures; they were nationwide instructions that, if left standing, would change who can vote and whose ballots count.\
\
The same week saw a parallel effort to weaken the organized power of workers inside the federal government. On March 27, Trump signed an executive order excluding large swaths of agencies from the federal labor\uc0\u8209 management program, citing national security. The order reached across the State Department, Defense, Homeland Security, and other security\u8209 linked offices, and it delegated authority to cabinet secretaries to suspend bargaining rights in additional subdivisions. A separate order, issued the same day and followed by an Office of Personnel Management memo, went further, directing departments to terminate existing collective bargaining agreements and stop deducting union dues from paychecks. These steps came on top of earlier mass firings of probationary employees and new reports that officials were seeking to cut between 8% and 50% of staff in key agencies, including Housing and Urban Development, Interior, the IRS, and HHS. Together, they did more than trim budgets. They restructured the civil service into a more precarious, more politicized workforce, with fewer protections against arbitrary dismissal and fewer organized voices able to resist unlawful orders. The Clock registered this as a steep rise in the politicization of the civil service and in the erosion of labor protections, because the change was structural and nationwide.\
\
Universities, long treated as semi\uc0\u8209 autonomous spaces for research and debate, were pulled more tightly into the orbit of federal power. Columbia University became a central example. The administration withheld $400 million in federal grants, citing concerns about antisemitism and campus protests, and signaled that funds would remain frozen until the university complied with its demands. At the same time, immigration authorities targeted pro\u8209 Palestinian students and scholars for detention and deportation, including Yunseo Chung at Columbia and Rumeysa Ozturk at Tufts, often in defiance of court orders requiring notice before transfers. Academic associations sued, arguing that the government was creating a \'93climate of repression\'94 on campuses. In Michigan, the state\'92s flagship university shut down its diversity, equity, and inclusion office and related programs, explicitly citing federal anti\u8209 DEI orders and threats to funding. These were not isolated disputes over policy. They were coordinated uses of money, immigration power, and regulatory threat to force universities to align with the administration\'92s ideological line or risk financial and human costs. The trait \'93universities pressured to suppress dissent or lose funding\'94 moved sharply upward, because the pattern now spanned grants, visas, and internal programming.\
\
The week also made clear that citizenship and legal presence were being stratified by ideology and origin. The Alien Enemies Act, a statute from 1798, was invoked to deport Venezuelan men labeled as gang members to El Salvador, where they were placed in a mega\uc0\u8209 prison notorious for its conditions. Tattoos that families described as religious or football\u8209 related were treated as gang markers. A federal judge ordered the flights turned around, but the administration argued that the court lacked jurisdiction once planes were over international waters and continued deportations. An appeals court upheld a temporary block on further removals, and a split panel compared the treatment of these migrants unfavorably to how Nazis had been handled under the same law. At the same time, ICE detained students from Turkey, Iran, and Russia\'97some with valid visas, some with pending asylum claims\'97often during routine check\u8209 ins or outside their homes, and transferred them far from their communities. The State Department issued a directive requiring consular officers to comb through student visa applicants\'92 social media for signs of \'93advocacy\'94 of terrorism, with a standard broad enough to sweep in pro\u8209 Palestinian speech. These actions did not abolish formal categories of citizenship, but they made clear that the practical security of one\'92s status now depended heavily on politics, nationality, and perceived loyalty. The Clock\'92s measure of citizenship stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage rose accordingly.\
\
If universities and migrants were one front, the legal profession was another. Over the course of the week, Trump signed or threatened a series of executive orders targeting major law firms\'97Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, Covington & Burling, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Skadden. The orders revoked security clearances for their lawyers, barred them from federal buildings, and instructed agencies and contractors to sever business ties. The stated justifications invoked national security and alleged discrimination, but the common thread was that these firms had represented clients or causes adverse to Trump: special counsels, Democratic campaigns, or plaintiffs challenging his policies. In some cases, the White House used the threat of such orders to extract concessions. Paul Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono services to causes the president supported; Skadden committed at least $100 million in similar work and pledged to avoid race\uc0\u8209 based hiring. Once those deals were struck, the orders were withdrawn or softened. Perkins Coie obtained a temporary restraining order from Judge Beryl Howell, who warned that the executive action threatened the foundation of legal practice. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale sued to block the orders aimed at them. But the message to the bar was clear: representing certain clients could bring not only political blowback but the loss of clearances, contracts, and access. The trait \'93law is a weapon of the state, not a limit on its power\'94 moved higher, because the executive was now using its formal tools to coerce and discipline the very actors meant to test its actions in court.\
\
These legal moves were reinforced by direct attacks on the judiciary itself. House Republicans introduced resolutions to impeach Judge James Boasberg and several other judges who had ruled against the administration, particularly in deportation cases. Trump publicly called Boasberg a \'93radical left lunatic\'94 and demanded his removal. When Boasberg ordered the preservation of Signal messages used to plan airstrikes in Yemen, the Justice Department sought to have Judge Howell removed from a related case, alleging bias after she blocked parts of an order against Perkins Coie. House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that Congress had the power to defund, restructure, or even eliminate federal courts that stood in the way, later insisting he was only describing constitutional authority. A retired conservative judge, J. Michael Luttig, wrote that Trump was \'93declaring war\'94 on the judicial system and provoking a constitutional crisis. Courts did push back: appellate panels upheld blocks on Alien Enemies Act deportations and ordered the rehiring of thousands of fired federal workers; district judges halted the trans military ban and protected individual students from deportation. But the balance of pressure shifted. Judges who enforced limits on executive power now faced impeachment threats, jurisdictional challenges, and personal vilification. The traits tracking judicial independence and the alignment of courts with donor and regime interests both edged upward.\
\
Behind these confrontations lay a quieter but no less important reshaping of the machinery of government. The Department of Education was ordered, by executive fiat, to begin dismantling itself. The Federal Student Aid office, which oversees $1.6 trillion in loans, had already seen mass firings of quality\uc0\u8209 assurance staff, raising the risk of fraud and abuse. At the Social Security Administration, a former operative from Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency was installed as Chief Information Officer just days after a court barred DOGE affiliates from accessing SSA databases. The move appeared designed to circumvent the restraining order by changing job titles rather than behavior. At Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs, close half the department\'92s regional offices, and create a new \'93administration for a healthy America,\'94 while simultaneously canceling more than $12 billion in grants for mental health, addiction treatment, and disease tracking. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spoke openly of eliminating FEMA, the federal disaster agency. These were not simple budget cuts. They hollowed out the capacity of agencies to deliver services and enforce laws, while leaving political appointees and favored contractors with greater relative power. The Clock\'92s measures for agency capture, civil service politicization, and the outsourcing of state power to unaccountable private actors all moved higher.\
\
The fusion of public authority with private wealth was most visible in the relationship between the administration and Elon Musk. Tesla and Musk\'92s other ventures appeared throughout the week\'92s events. The White House sought corporate sponsors for the Easter Egg Roll and had recently hosted a Tesla promotion on the South Lawn. The Department of Government Efficiency, run by Musk, was at the center of data\uc0\u8209 access fights with SSA and other agencies. The Justice Department and FBI formed task forces and reassigned up to a thousand agents to investigate vandalism at Tesla dealerships and charging stations, labeling some acts as domestic terrorism. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced charges against individuals accused of damaging Tesla property and compared such vandalism unfavorably to the January 6 attack. At the same time, Musk\'92s PAC poured $19 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, offered $100 payments and a $1 million prize tied to petition\u8209 signing, and publicly awarded a $1 million payout to a Wisconsin voter. State officials called the scheme corrupt; the Wisconsin Department of Justice prepared legal action. Yet the overall pattern was unmistakable: a favored corporate ally received promotional access to the White House, extraordinary law\u8209 enforcement attention, and de facto influence over judicial elections, while critics of that ally were labeled terrorists or insurrectionists. The trait \'93crony capitalism indistinguishable from governance\'94 rose again.\
\
Information itself became both a battleground and a tool. The week\'92s most dramatic example was the \'93Signalgate\'94 scandal. Senior officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, had used an unapproved Signal group chat to plan airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. By error, they added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, to the chat. The messages, some of which were later published, contained operational details about F\uc0\u8209 18 deployments, drone launches, and timing. They also included disparaging remarks about European allies and discussions of potential economic gains. The Pentagon had already warned staff against using Signal due to a vulnerability exploitable by Russian hackers. Intelligence chiefs testified before Congress, insisting that no classified information had been shared, even as subsequent leaks showed otherwise. American Oversight sued, arguing that the auto\u8209 deleting chats violated the Federal Records Act. Judge Boasberg ordered the preservation of all messages. German reporters then found the private email addresses and passwords of several officials involved in the scandal in commercial data dumps. Through it all, Trump refused to fire Waltz or Hegseth, describing the leak as a minor glitch. The Clock recorded this as a deepening of two traits: the use of chaos and overlapping scandals to diffuse accountability, and the sealing or destruction of archives that might later reveal how decisions were made.\
\
Alongside these structural shifts, the administration moved to control the story the country tells about itself. On March 27, Trump signed an order titled \'93Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\'94 It directed Vice President Vance and other officials to ensure that federal sites, including the Smithsonian, presented a \'93positive\'94 portrayal of American history, to restore monuments, and to remove exhibits deemed \'93improper, divisive, or anti\uc0\u8209 American.\'94 A separate order targeted Smithsonian funding more directly, mandating the appointment of new regents aligned with the administration\'92s view. The same week, Trump\'92s expansionist talk about acquiring Greenland, Canada, the Panama Canal, and Gaza drew warnings from experts that such rhetoric threatened the post\u8209 war norm against territorial conquest. In Texas, the legislature advanced bills requiring daily prayer or religious\u8209 text readings in schools and mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms. The University of Michigan, under pressure from federal anti\u8209 DEI orders and the Supreme Court\'92s affirmative action ruling, closed its DEI office and related programs. Together, these moves did not erase history overnight. They did, however, shift control over textbooks, museums, and curricula toward the executive and its allies, with the explicit aim of sanitizing past injustices and elevating conquest and unity over conflict and accountability. The traits tracking national history rewritten to glorify conquest, civic education hollowed out, and memory curated by power all moved noticeably.\
\
Surveillance and data use were another through\uc0\u8209 line. The IRS moved toward a deal with ICE to share confidential tax data on undocumented filers, breaking a long\u8209 standing firewall meant to encourage honest reporting. The Social Security Administration, under pressure from DOGE, saw its acting commissioner threaten to shut down the agency in response to a court order limiting data sharing, and then installed a DOGE veteran as CIO. The State Department\'92s new visa directive mandated social\u8209 media reviews and evidence preservation for student applicants. The administration quietly paused green card processing for some approved refugees and began inspecting the social media of green card and citizenship applicants for \'93hostile attitudes.\'94 At the same time, the administration cut funding for a national database tracking domestic terrorism, hate crimes, and school shootings, making it harder to see patterns of violence at home. The net effect was to expand surveillance of vulnerable populations while reducing the data available to track threats that might implicate domestic extremists or gun policy. The Clock\'92s measure of \'93surveillance of ordinary citizens increases; elite crimes remain opaque\'94 edged closer to its ceiling.\
\
Not every development pointed in the same direction. Courts blocked the trans military ban and preserved funding for Radio Free Europe. A federal judge in New York protected Yunseo Chung from deportation, finding no evidence she posed a danger. Appeals courts upheld orders requiring the rehiring of thousands of fired federal workers and maintaining a block on Alien Enemies Act deportations. The National Labor Relations Board modernized its FOIA systems, and the EPA continued routine environmental rulemakings. Civil society mobilized: protesters gathered at Tesla dealerships under the \'93TeslaTakedown\'94 banner; Sanders and Ocasio\uc0\u8209 Cortez drew large crowds on a \'93Fighting Oligarchy\'94 tour; unions and academic groups filed suits to defend research funding and campus speech. In Pennsylvania, a Democrat won a state senate seat in a district Trump had carried by 57%, hinting at electoral backlash. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s structural changes, but they showed that institutional resistance and public organizing remained live forces.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 10, several processes were already in motion. The new election executive orders were certain to face court challenges from states and advocacy groups, with early suits already filed. The lawsuits by Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and American Oversight would test whether the judiciary would protect law firms and records laws from executive retaliation. The Supreme Court was being asked, on an emergency basis, to bless or halt the use of the Alien Enemies Act for mass deportations. Congressional committees had opened inquiries into the Signal scandal, and the Pentagon\'92s inspector general had been asked to investigate. State authorities in Wisconsin were preparing to test the boundaries of election law against Musk\'92s incentives program. And the coalition suing to stop the dismantling of the Department of Education would force courts to decide how far a president can go in unmaking a cabinet agency without Congress. These were not speculative risks; they were scheduled confrontations that would determine whether the week\'92s shifts hardened into precedent.\
\
By the close of Week 10, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'978:54 p.m.\'97captured a landscape in which the formal shell of democracy still stood, but many of its internal supports had been cut or repurposed. Executive orders now reached into the core of elections, labor rights, and education, often with little regard for legislative process. Law firms, universities, and migrants found themselves on the receiving end of targeted state power when they crossed the regime\'92s interests. Emergency statutes and national security claims were used to justify deportations, secrecy, and the sidelining of courts. Museums and schools were instructed to tell a narrower, more flattering story about the nation\'92s past. At the same time, courts, state officials, and civil society actors continued to resist, buying time and preserving pockets of autonomy. The week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly the distance between formal democracy and managed democracy can shrink when power is willing to use every available tool. The clock now reads 8:54 p.m. The hour is not yet so late that change is impossible, but it is late enough that repair will require more than a change of mood; it will require a deliberate effort to rebuild the limits that this week pushed aside.\
