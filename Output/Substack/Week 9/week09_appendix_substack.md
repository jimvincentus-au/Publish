# Week 9 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance

*In Trump’s ninth week back in office, wartime statutes, deportation flights, and agency purges turned law and bureaucracy into pliable tools of executive will.*

![Header image](image_wide_week9_appendix.png)

This week represents an acute stress test of American constitutionalism, with the executive branch openly defying courts, hollowing out key departments, and weaponizing immigration and education policy for ideological ends. The most intense structural pressure falls on rule of law and separation of powers: mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act proceeded in direct defiance of multiple federal orders, while Trump and congressional allies escalated attacks on Judge Boasberg, including impeachment articles and removal efforts. Simultaneously, the administration moved to dismantle the Department of Education, reassign student loans to the SBA, gut USAID and cultural agencies, and give Elon Musk’s DOGE sweeping access to federal systems—only partially checked by federal judges. Universities, immigrants, and protesters are targeted through funding freezes, visa revocations, and criminalization of activism, while independent media (USAGM/VOA, RFE/RL, AP access) is aggressively curtailed. Courts, state AGs, and some judges mounted significant resistance, securing TROs on deportations, DEI rollbacks, USAID, DOGE data grabs, and climate funds. But the pattern is clear: rapid executive overreach, privatization of state power, and normalization of constitutional brinkmanship.

Power and Authority

1. President Donald Trump used a Justice Department speech to air personal grievances about criminal cases (2025-03-15): Trump’s use of a Justice Department policy speech to relitigate his own criminal cases blurred the line between personal interests and neutral law enforcement, signaling pressure on the department to serve the president’s political narrative.

2. President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize arrests and deportations of noncitizens (2025-03-15): Trump’s peacetime invocation of an 18th‑century wartime statute to arrest and deport alleged Venezuelan gang members expanded emergency-style executive power over noncitizens and weakened due process protections.

3. Trump administration deported hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador despite a federal court order (2025-03-16): By continuing mass deportation flights to El Salvador after Judge Boasberg’s restraining order, the administration openly defied judicial authority, undermining checks on executive power and weakening the rule of law.

4. President Donald Trump ordered US military airstrikes in Yemen without congressional authorization (2025-03-16): Unilateral airstrikes in Yemen that killed dozens of civilians, launched without explicit congressional authorization, concentrated war‑making power in the presidency and sidestepped democratic oversight of lethal force.

5. President Donald Trump declared that President Biden’s pardons were void because they used an autopen signature (2025-03-16): Trump’s assertion that Biden’s autopen‑signed pardons are legally void challenged the settled validity of presidential clemency and suggested a president can unilaterally nullify a predecessor’s lawful acts.

6. President Donald Trump revoked Secret Service protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden (2025-03-17): Revoking security details for Biden’s adult children used presidential control over protective services in a way that appeared retaliatory, raising concerns about politicized use of personal security decisions.

9. President Donald Trump announced broad expansions of presidential power over protests and immigration enforcement (2025-03-16): Commentary described the administration’s push to incarcerate protesters and deport immigrants as part of a broader expansion of presidential authority that risks eroding civil liberties and institutional checks.

10. President Donald Trump signed an order eliminating the US Agency for Global Media and restructuring its outlets (2025-03-15): Eliminating USAGM and sidelining Voice of America and related broadcasters concentrated control of state‑funded international media in the executive, weakening semi‑independent channels that had provided diverse information abroad.

11. President Donald Trump signed an executive order dismantling the Department of Education and shifting its functions (2025-03-20): Trump’s orders to close the congressionally created Education Department and reassign student loans and disability services attempted to restructure a core domestic agency by decree, bypassing normal legislative processes.

14. President Donald Trump signed an order granting DOGE access to unclassified federal agency systems and records (2025-03-19): Granting the Department of Government Efficiency sweeping access to agency data and software systems concentrated informational power in a lightly accountable White House‑aligned unit, raising risks of politicized use of administrative data.

15.

17.

18.

23. President Donald Trump suggested 20-year El Salvador prison sentences for Tesla vandals (2025-03-20): Trump’s call to send US Tesla vandals to serve long sentences in El Salvador invoked foreign carceral systems as a punitive tool, signaling extreme, extraterritorial punishment proposals tied to a favored corporation.

8. Federal courts issued and expanded temporary restraining orders limiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (2025-03-16): Judge Boasberg’s TROs restricting use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans asserted that wartime powers cannot be stretched to peacetime mass removals, reinforcing legal limits on executive immigration authority.
