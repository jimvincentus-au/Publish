In Week 6 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been emerging snapped into clearer focus. The presidency was no longer only pushing at the edges of its authority; it was building a new center of gravity for power that ran through Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency, a politicized justice system, and a hollowed-out civil service. The week\'92s events showed how law, money, and force were being rewired to serve a narrow circle of leaders and benefactors, while the rest of the state was treated as expendable. At the same time, courts, unions, state officials, and ordinary citizens mounted scattered but real resistance, trying to hold onto the idea that public institutions exist to serve the whole people, not a ruling network. The Democracy Clock moved only slightly, but the direction was unmistakable. The system was still functioning, yet more of its load-bearing beams had been cut.\
\
At the start of Week 6, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:51 p.m. By the end, it read 7:52 p.m., a net movement of 0.2 minutes toward midnight. On its face, that is a small shift. But the underlying traits that moved tell a different story. The presence of \'93civil service roles are politicized or privatized\'94 and \'93crony capitalism becomes indistinguishable from governance\'94 both jumped sharply. So did \'93citizenship is stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage,\'94 \'93law is a weapon, not a limit,\'94 and \'93independent media is starved while state-aligned outlets thrive.\'94 The week did not bring a single dramatic break. Instead, it layered many coordinated changes that deepened executive control over money and people, rewarded loyal elites with legal indulgence, and narrowed the space for independent information. The small tick on the Clock reflects that the formal shell of democracy still stands, but more of its interior has been converted into a patronage system.\
\
The most consequential development was the consolidation of fiscal and personnel power under the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with Elon Musk at its center. Through a series of orders and memos, Trump placed all federal payments for contracts, grants, and loans under DOGE\'92s oversight, and then froze government credit cards for thirty days. Agencies were told that every payment must be recorded and justified in a centralized system monitored by Musk\'92s team. In parallel, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management ordered agencies to prepare large-scale reductions in force and reorganization plans by mid-March, and OPM moved to reclassify top career posts as political appointments. Together, these steps shifted practical control of the federal purse and the federal workforce away from Congress and the traditional civil-service structure into a new, loosely defined hub that answered to the president and his chosen private adviser. This was not just about cutting budgets. It was about who decides which programs live or die, and on what grounds.\
\
The impact on the civil service was immediate and uneven. Probationary workers at science agencies like NOAA, NASA, and the CDC were fired in batches, while USAID staff were placed on leave and then invited back only to collect their belongings as the administration moved to eliminate thousands of positions. The Social Security Administration announced a major restructuring that could cut up to half its workforce, and the Department of Education dangled buyouts that were less generous than standard severance, nudging employees to leave before a planned abolition of the department itself. At NOAA, hundreds of climate and weather experts lost their jobs, with more cuts promised. These moves did not simply reduce headcount. They stripped expertise from agencies that manage weather warnings, disease surveillance, retirement benefits, and foreign aid. The winners were those who gained leverage over what remained: the president, his budget aides, and Musk\'92s DOGE. The losers were the public servants whose careers had been built on neutral competence, and the citizens who rely on their work.\
\
Within this new structure, law and regulation increasingly bent toward those with money and proximity to power. The Securities and Exchange Commission quietly agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase, which had poured tens of millions into a pro-crypto Super PAC and Trump-aligned causes, and halted its fraud prosecution of Justin Sun after he invested heavily in a Trump-backed financial venture. In both cases, there were no fines, no admissions, and no changes in business practices. At the same time, Jared Kushner\'92s private equity fund, backed by billions from Saudi Arabia and other foreign sovereign funds, continued to operate in the background of Middle East policy, including plans to redevelop Gaza. These episodes did not prove a single quid pro quo, but they fit a pattern. Enforcement against well-connected financial actors was softened or delayed, while their investments flowed into ventures that enriched or amplified the regime. The trait \'93wealth buys not only speech, but law\'94 moved higher because the line between legal risk and political generosity grew thinner.\
\
The justice system itself was being reshaped to serve as a tool rather than a check. Trump\'92s mass pardons for January 6 participants, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, erased much of the legal consequence for an attack on Congress. The expansion of those pardons to cover related gun and drug charges deepened that signal: violence in defense of the leader might be forgiven, even celebrated. Pardoned defendants announced plans to sue the Justice Department for prosecuting them, and Tarrio used his freedom to confront and taunt officers who had defended the Capitol. At the same time, the interim US attorney for Washington, Ed Martin, declared publicly that he and his colleagues were \'93President Trump\'92s lawyers,\'94 not independent prosecutors bound to the Constitution. He had already promised to protect Musk\'92s interests and to revisit Capitol attack cases after the pardons. These moves told career lawyers and investigators that their work would be judged not by law but by loyalty. That message was clear.\
\
The FBI and the broader security apparatus were drawn into this orbit. Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist with far-right sympathies, was appointed FBI director, with Dan Bongino, a conspiracy broadcaster and election denier, as his deputy. One of Patel\'92s first acts was to relocate up to 1,500 agents out of the Hoover Building, including counterterrorism and national security investigators, and to demand the names of thousands of agents who had worked on January 6 cases. Experts warned that far-right extremism would be deprioritized while Black Lives Matter activists, antifascists, and media might become new targets. In parallel, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to fire the judge advocates general of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the lawyers who administer military justice, and Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, along with other senior commanders, moving to install a less-qualified loyalist. The Pentagon also received orders to identify and discharge transgender troops and to scrub references to diversity and inclusion from its communications. These steps weakened internal legal constraints and signaled that the armed forces and federal law enforcement were expected to align with the president\'92s political agenda. The security state was being retuned.\
\
Against this backdrop, the administration\'92s treatment of migrants and minorities illustrated how citizenship itself was being stratified. Trump announced what he called the largest deportation operation in American history, directed ICE to deport hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied children, and ordered DHS and the Pentagon to prepare a 30,000-bed migrant detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Reports from the base described migrants shackled, caged, strip-searched, and denied legal calls. The State Department imposed permanent visa bans on transgender athletes and ordered consular officers to deny entry to those who misrepresented their birth sex. Undocumented immigrants aged fourteen and older were required to register with USCIS and provide fingerprints under penalty. At the same time, Trump proposed a \'93gold card\'94 that would sell a path to citizenship for $5 million, explicitly opening a premium lane for the wealthy, including foreign oligarchs. Together, these policies carved the population into tiers: those whose status could be bought, those whose status could be revoked or degraded based on identity, and those whose presence could be treated as a security problem rather than a human fact.\
\
The same logic extended into domestic civil rights. An executive order banned transgender athletes from women\'92s sports nationwide, and the administration threatened to cut federal funds from states that refused to comply. Maine\'92s governor publicly defied the order, but the Department of Education responded by opening a Title IX investigation into the state. The State Department\'92s visa bans on trans athletes exported this culture war into foreign policy. Within the federal workforce, a new order targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and the Social Security Administration shut down its civil rights and equal opportunity office. The Department of Education launched an \'93End DEI\'94 portal inviting citizens to report diversity practices in schools, while educators and teachers\'92 unions turned to the courts to challenge anti-DEI guidance. These moves did not yet erase all protections. They did, however, shift the burden of defending equality onto those with fewer resources, while the machinery of the state was used to police and punish inclusion efforts.\
\
Information and memory became another front. The White House moved to control the presidential press pool, stripping the White House Correspondents\'92 Association of its traditional role and reserving to itself the power to decide which outlets could attend. The Associated Press and Reuters were barred from key events after refusing to adopt Trump\'92s unilateral renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the \'93Gulf of America.\'94 A federal judge declined to grant AP an emergency order restoring access, distinguishing between public and \'93more private\'94 spaces, and the administration used that space to entrench its naming demand. At a joint press conference with Emmanuel Macron, Trump called first on a far-right journalist, signaling preference for friendly voices. At the Kennedy Center, an LGBTQ+ orchestra was disinvited as \'93anti-American propaganda\'94 after Trump allies took over the board. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos\'92s decision to steer the Washington Post\'92s opinion section toward \'93personal liberties\'94 and \'93free markets\'94 prompted the resignation of the opinion editor and several writers, underscoring how concentrated ownership can narrow the range of views in mainstream media. The net effect was to starve independent outlets of access and space while elevating state-aligned and oligarch-aligned voices.\
\
The administration also experimented with new tools of propaganda and erasure. It posted a video of migrants in shackles labeled \'93ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,\'94 turning human suffering into a kind of dark entertainment. It shared an AI-generated \'93Trump Gaza\'94 resort video that depicted a cleansed, luxury coastline crowned by a golden statue of Trump, promoting a plan to remove Palestinians and redevelop the strip as a playground. Hackers, in turn, used AI satire to broadcast a video of Trump kissing Musk\'92s feet on HUD building screens, revealing both the vulnerability of government systems and the growing role of synthetic media in political protest. DOGE\'92s website initially boasted billions in supposed savings, including miscounted cuts at ICE and USAID, only to quietly delete the largest claims after press scrutiny. The Department of Justice released a limited set of Jeffrey Epstein files not to Congress but to a group of right-wing influencers, who were then briefed at the White House. In each case, those in power curated what the public could see and remember, while inconvenient records\'97such as the national police misconduct database\'97were shut down. Memory itself was being managed.\
\
Foreign policy, too, shifted away from traditional democratic alliances toward transactional and authoritarian-friendly arrangements. At the United Nations, the United States voted against a General Assembly resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, aligning with Russia and a handful of its allies, even as the resolution passed with broad support. The US also drafted a Security Council resolution that took a more conciliatory line toward Russia, which Moscow then supported. Trump ordered his officials to negotiate an end to the war directly with Russian counterparts, excluding Ukraine and European leaders. In Washington, a contentious Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky saw Trump and Senator JD Vance demand mineral concessions in exchange for military aid, and Trump later considered halting all aid shipments. A revised deal promised $350 billion in aid tied to US access to Ukrainian minerals but offered no long-term security guarantees. In the Middle East, Kushner and a Trump envoy worked on plans to redevelop Gaza, and Trump\'92s AI video promoted an ethnic-cleansing vision as a triumph. Cuts to USAID and UNAIDS funding, and pressure on Romania to lift travel bans on controversial figures like Andrew Tate, reinforced the impression that human rights and rule-of-law concerns were subordinate to personal and political ties.\
\
Yet the week also contained pockets of institutional resistance. Federal judges issued temporary restraining orders blocking DOGE\'92s access to vast troves of personal data from OPM and the Department of Education, and halting the freezing of federal loans and grants. Another court blocked Trump\'92s order suspending refugee admissions, and ordered the administration to pay billions in previously withheld foreign aid, though the Supreme Court stayed that order in part. A judge in California ruled that OPM lacked authority to order mass firings of federal employees, pausing a key mechanism for politicizing the civil service. Courts in Maryland and elsewhere enjoined anti-DEI orders, preserving some diversity programs in agencies and higher education. A federal judge extended protections for trans women in prison, blocking transfers to men\'92s facilities. These rulings did not reverse the broader trend. They did show that parts of the judiciary still understood themselves as limits on power, not instruments of it.\
\
Civil society responded in its own ways. Federal employee unions amended their lawsuits to challenge Musk\'92s directives and DOGE\'92s data access, and twenty-one DOGE staffers resigned rather than help dismantle public services or compromise sensitive systems. State officials like Maine\'92s governor publicly defied federal orders on transgender athletes. Protesters gathered at Tesla dealerships to denounce Musk\'92s role in government and his access to data. Americans participated in a 24-hour economic boycott organized by the People\'92s Union USA, withholding spending or directing it to local cash purchases to protest cuts to DEI, healthcare, and social services. These acts did not stop the executive orders or the budget resolutions. They did keep alive the idea that citizens and workers could still say no, even at personal cost.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 6, several decisions were already in motion. Agencies faced a March 13 deadline to submit layoff and reorganization plans under DOGE\'92s framework. The Senate was preparing to vote on the confirmation of Linda McMahon as education secretary, with an executive order to abolish the department reportedly ready. Courts had scheduled further hearings on AP\'92s access lawsuit, DOGE\'92s data grabs, and the legality of mass firings. The minerals deal with Ukraine and the Gaza redevelopment plans were moving toward more concrete stages, with foreign leaders and developers watching closely. Each of these processes would test whether the remaining checks\'97Congress, courts, civil servants, and allies\'97could slow or reshape the trajectory that Week 6 made visible.\
\
By the close of the week, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time, 7:52 p.m., captured a system under strain but not yet broken. The formal structures of elections, courts, and agencies remained, but their inner workings were being repurposed. Executive power operated with less effective oversight as DOGE centralized spending and personnel decisions. Law served more often as a shield for allies and a sword against critics, especially when large donations or personal ties were involved. Citizenship and access to rights were increasingly sorted by wealth, identity, and loyalty. Independent media and civic memory were narrowed through access control, curated disclosures, and synthetic spectacle. At the same time, judges, unions, state officials, and protesters showed that resistance was still possible, even if fragmented and reactive. Week 6 matters in the larger arc of the term because it marks a point where the machinery of government began to look less like a neutral framework and more like an instrument of a patronage autocracy. The Clock\'92s small movement masks a deeper shift: the distance between law and power grew shorter, and the work of defending democracy moved further from routine politics into the realm of emergency repair.\
