Week 26 of Trump’s second term registered no movement on the Democracy Clock, holding at 8:06 p.m., yet the apparent stillness masked a dense consolidation of power. Immigration enforcement hardened into a standing emergency: militarized raids at cannabis farms left workers injured and one dead, bond hearings were stripped from judges, rapid deportations expanded, and confidential tax and health data were repurposed for targeting. Masked agents staged mass removals from sites like Terminal Island, while courts offered only partial friction. Inside the state, an executive order creating Schedule G, mass layoffs at State and Education, politicized appointments at DOJ, NIH, and VA, and FEMA centralization pushed the civil service toward loyalty over competence. Simultaneously, the Epstein files saga showcased secrecy as method: DOJ opacity, missing video, retaliatory firings, and blocked amendments gave way to tactical unsealing under pressure. Cuts to public media, climate and economic data, housing enforcement, and foreign aid hollowed public goods as tariffs, surveillance contracts, and Trump’s revived foreign business deals enriched aligned actors. Resistance—from courts, states, and civil society—surfaced as friction, not reversal.
