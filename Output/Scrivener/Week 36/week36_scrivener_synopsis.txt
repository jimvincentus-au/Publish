Week 36 of Trump’s second term brought no single rupture, but a dense layering of moves that left the state feeling less like a shared instrument and more like a partisan weapon. The Democracy Clock held at 8:08 p.m., masking a volatile balance between deepening authoritarian practices and scattered resistance. At the Justice Department, the Public Integrity Section was quietly hollowed out while the Tom Homan bribery case was closed despite recorded evidence, even as prosecutors were pushed to indict James Comey and investigate John Brennan. A domestic terrorism order targeting Antifa and a memo casting left-leaning groups as a “terror network” re-aimed security powers at dissent, while Congress poured $170 billion into ICE as it detained more non‑criminal immigrants and faced hunger strikes over brutal conditions. Federal agencies froze Kansas food aid, punished trans‑inclusive schools, and sued states for voter data, even as USDA and BLS erased key hunger and inflation metrics. Pentagon press pledges, FCC license threats over Jimmy Kimmel, and politicized archival leaks tightened control over information and memory. Courts, states, and civil society won scattered victories, but the week’s throughline was the normalization of law, hunger, and data as tools of leverage.
