Painterly, realistic style, moody atmosphere, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 19 of Trump\u2019s second term left the Democracy Clock at 7:59 p.m., with only a 0.2\u2011minute shift, yet the apparent stillness masked a coordinated deepening of executive dominance. Immigration became the sharpest edge: humanitarian parole and protected status for hundreds of thousands were revoked with Supreme Court backing, arrest quotas turned enforcement into a numbers game, and social media vetting froze student visas worldwide. Universities and public media were targeted as rival centers of authority, with Harvard stripped of contracts and foreign-student authority and NPR and PBS cut off from federal funds, even as courts issued temporary injunctions. Clemency and corporate settlements favored corrupt officials, reality\u2011TV fraudsters, and Boeing, while migrants and low\u2011status defendants faced harsher treatment. Emergency tariffs, Trump\u2011linked foreign deals, and policy\u2011tied investment products fused economic governance with personal and crony gain. Courts, state attorneys general, parents, and mass protest movements pushed back, but each act of resistance required greater effort against a presidency increasingly treating law as weapon rather than limit.",
