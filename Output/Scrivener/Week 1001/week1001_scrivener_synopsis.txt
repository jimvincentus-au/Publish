This opening chapter steps back from the week-by-week record to ask a prior question: why does any society need government, and what makes that government legitimate? It argues that governance is a universal human response to conflict and scarcity, not an American invention or a partisan preference. Authority, in some form, is inevitable; legitimacy is not. The chapter traces how most historical regimes have ruled through force, lineage, or priesthood, and why they proved unstable. Against that backdrop, democracy appears as a rare design that grounds power in the governed and builds in mechanisms for peaceful correction. American democracy is presented as an audacious, unfinished experiment in accountable self-rule, now strained by inequality, disinformation, and leaders who treat constraints as obstacles. The chapter frames the Democracy Clock project as a structural inquiry into how institutions are repurposed when authority persists but legitimacy erodes.
