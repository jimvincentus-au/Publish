Week 36 of Trump’s second term traced how law and security were further converted into instruments of political rule. The White House branded “antifa” a domestic terrorist organization and issued a sweeping domestic terrorism memorandum, inviting surveillance and prosecution of loosely defined left-wing networks. Prosecutorial power was bent toward retribution: James Comey was indicted after prior declinations, while investigations into John Brennan, John Bolton, and Soros-linked groups advanced even as a taped bribery case against border czar Tom Homan was closed and the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section hollowed out. Loyalists like Lindsey Halligan replaced resistant prosecutors, and the civil service faced threatened mass firings and loyalty metrics. Immigration enforcement expanded with massive ICE funding and rising detention of non-criminal immigrants amid hunger strikes and deaths in custody. Simultaneously, independent media and data were constrained through Pentagon press restrictions, FCC threats against ABC, and the suppression of labor and food-security statistics. Courts offered uneven checks, while scattered acts of resistance and local accountability persisted but could not offset a systemic tightening of executive power.
