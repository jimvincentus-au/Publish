Week 14 of Trump’s second term saw power not just concentrated but rewired. The White House turned universities and immigration enforcement into levers of control, freezing billions in Harvard funding, conditioning aid to Columbia, and pressuring campuses through antisemitism taskforces, intrusive EEOC surveys, and ICE partnerships. Academic freedom and civic education were recast as privileges contingent on political compliance. At the border and beyond, lawful residents and even U.S. citizens were detained or deported, while oversight offices for immigration detention were shuttered, stratifying rights by heritage and ideology. Courts issued significant checks—blocking mass deportations, sanctuary-city defunding, and a proof-of-citizenship voter rule—but the administration openly defied orders and threatened judges, treating law as weapon rather than limit. Inside the executive, agencies from Interior to State, HHS, and DOGE were repurposed toward loyalists and private interests. The Democracy Clock moved from 10:19 to 10:24 p.m., reflecting a dense, systemic tightening of executive control despite visible resistance.
