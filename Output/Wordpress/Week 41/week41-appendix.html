<h1>Week 41 Appendix: Shutdown and Ballrooms as Rule</h1>
<p><em>A fourth week of shutdown, militarized immigration, and donor-funded monuments showed power consolidating quietly as law, welfare, and truth bent around one man’s needs.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the Trump administration using the shutdown, immigration crackdown, and foreign policy to deepen personalist control and monetize the state. Structurally, the heaviest pressure fell on executive overreach, politicization of the civil service, crony capitalism, and stratified citizenship. The shutdown became a weapon: SNAP and CDC cuts, refusal to use contingency funds, and House inaction shifted risk and suffering onto the poor while preserving elite projects like the privately funded White House ballroom. Immigration and internal security policy were centralized around Stephen Miller, with ICE leadership purged, Border Patrol militarized in cities, secret detention sites expanded, and visas revoked for critics, sharply degrading rule of law and equal citizenship. Simultaneously, pardons and contracts tied to Trump-linked crypto and donors entrenched a pay‑to‑play justice system. Yet courts and some in Congress mounted notable resistance—blocking SNAP suspensions, voter‑ID requirements, and some tariff powers—showing institutional antibodies still firing even as the overall balance of pressure moved strongly toward entrenched executive dominance and normalized emergency governance.</p>
