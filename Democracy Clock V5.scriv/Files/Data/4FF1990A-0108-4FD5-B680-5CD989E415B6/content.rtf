\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 12 records a small numerical shift on the Democracy Clock\'970.2 minutes, from 7:49 to 7:50 p.m.\'97but a large consolidation of method. The presidency governed by decree, using emergency trade powers, immigration law, and targeted executive orders to punish critics and reward allies. Law firms were coerced into pro-regime work, universities threatened with consent decrees and funding freezes, and climate and social-science agencies gutted or outsourced to loyal contractors. Immigration enforcement, supercharged by the Alien Enemies Act, IRS\'96DHS data-mining, and a vast detention build-out, turned legal status into a revocable favor. Security forces were redirected toward domestic control, while tariffs whipsawed markets amid suspicions of insider trading. Voting rules tightened under the banner of \'93integrity,\'94 and public memory was curated through anti-DEI purges in museums, libraries, and federal communications. Courts, protests, and some senators pushed back, but mostly as case-by-case friction against an executive increasingly willing to act first and answer later.\
