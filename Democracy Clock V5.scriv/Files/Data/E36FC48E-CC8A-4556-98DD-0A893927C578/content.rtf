In Week 23, the story of the term narrowed around one stark pattern: force moved to the center of governance. The same hand that ordered stealth bombers toward Iranian nuclear sites sent Marines and National Guard troops into Los Angeles streets, while masked agents swept immigrant neighborhoods and courthouses. Law, which in a constitutional order should stand above these acts, was instead bent to clear their path or to punish those who tried to resist. The week did not yet bring a single irreversible break. It did show how war abroad, emergency at home, and the machinery of deportation can be fused into one system of rule.\
\
At the close of the prior period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:54 p.m. It now reads 7:56 p.m., a movement of 2.4 minutes toward midnight. That shift reflects not one spectacular event but a cluster of structural changes. The president launched and then defended large-scale strikes on Iran without congressional authorization, while the Supreme Court narrowed the power of lower courts to halt executive orders nationwide. At the same time, immigration enforcement hardened into a semi-militarized regime of raids, quotas, and new detention complexes, often in defiance or evasion of judicial orders. Oversight bodies in health and media were repopulated with loyalists, and independent broadcasters were gutted. Together, these moves deepened three linked traits: executive power operating without effective oversight, law used as a weapon rather than a limit, and security forces aligned with regime priorities rather than public defense.\
\
The week\'92s most visible rupture came from the sky. On June 21, the president ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities\'97Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan\'97using B\uc0\u8209 2 bombers and bunker-busting munitions. He did so without a congressional resolution, debate, or declaration of war, bypassing the War Powers Resolution\'92s core premise that sustained hostilities require legislative consent. In his own telling, the operation was a \'93spectacular military success\'94 that had \'93completely and totally obliterated\'94 Iran\'92s enrichment capacity. Intelligence assessments told a different story. The Defense Intelligence Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran\'92s program had been set back only by months, that much of its enriched uranium had been moved in advance, and that roughly 400 kilograms of 60 percent uranium remained in casks small enough to fit in a handful of car trunks. The president dismissed these findings as wrong. In doing so, he made clear that the measure of success would be his narrative, not the evidence.\
\
Congress tried to respond, but its tools proved blunt. Members from both chambers, including Democratic veterans and some Republicans, denounced the strikes as unconstitutional and drafted War Powers resolutions to limit further hostilities. Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, introduced such a resolution and was rewarded with renewed attacks from the president on social media, a warning to others in his party who might consider crossing the line between loyalty and oversight. Articles of impeachment over the unauthorized strikes were filed, but the House voted to table them, with only a minority of Democrats willing to press the case. At the same time, the administration canceled or postponed classified briefings on the operation and later announced that congressional access to sensitive intelligence would be restricted after a leak of the DIA assessment. The formal architecture of checks remained. In practice, the executive had moved a major piece on the board without meaningful constraint.\
\
The courts, too, felt their reach narrowed. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court\'92s conservative majority curtailed the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policies. In cases consolidated under Trump v. CASA, the Court held that district judges had likely exceeded their authority by blocking enforcement of an executive order on birthright citizenship across the entire country. Injunctions would henceforth bind only the named plaintiffs unless class status was granted. In another ruling, the Court declared that nationwide injunctions \'93likely exceed\'94 the authority Congress gave the judiciary, a principle that immediately affected challenges to the president\'92s attempt to end birthright citizenship and other orders. These decisions did not decide the underlying constitutional questions. They changed the terrain on which those questions will be fought. A president can now implement contested policies in large parts of the country while litigation grinds forward case by case.\
\
If war and doctrine marked the top of the system, immigration enforcement showed how those choices played out on the ground. The administration had already ordered ICE to target 3,000 arrests a day. By this week, detention numbers exceeded 56,000, a record high, and facilities were overcrowded and unsanitary. In Los Angeles, raids intensified. Masked agents in casual clothes swept streets and workplaces, often without clear warrants, detaining not only undocumented residents but U.S. citizens misidentified by appearance or accent. One citizen, Andrea Velez, was seized outside her workplace and held for more than a day before lawyers could locate her. Community health centers reported that no\uc0\u8209 show rates for appointments had tripled as patients feared leaving their homes, threatening both individual care and the financial viability of clinics. A national terrorism advisory, tied to the Iran conflict, added a further layer of anxiety, suggesting that foreign policy decisions were now feeding directly into domestic threat narratives.\
\
The machinery of detention expanded to meet this surge. In California, ICE partnered with CoreCivic to convert a shuttered 2,500\uc0\u8209 bed prison into the state\'92s largest immigrant detention center, backed by an initial $10 million contract. In Florida, state leaders and the Department of Homeland Security advanced plans for \'93Alligator Alcatraz,\'94 a tent city for up to 5,000 migrants on seized Everglades land. Governor Ron DeSantis used emergency powers to take 39 square miles from Miami\u8209 Dade County, bypassing local processes and environmental review. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued, arguing that the project could not proceed without a proper study of its impact on the fragile ecosystem. The lawsuit underscored a broader point. Emergency declarations and security rationales were being used to override not only individual rights but also local self\u8209 government and environmental stewardship.\
\
Inside this system, individual stories revealed the human cost. Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado, a 68\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old man, died while being transported by a private contractor from a local jail to a federal facility, the first such in\u8209 transit death in at least a decade. His family struggled to obtain basic information. In Louisiana, Iris Dayana Monterroso\u8209 Lemus, a pregnant detainee, reported being starved, shackled, and denied adequate medical care; she lost her baby under guard. In New Orleans, Mandonna \'93Donna\'94 Kashanian, a 64\u8209 year\u8209 old Iranian woman who had lived in the United States for 47 years with no criminal record, was arrested while gardening and moved through multiple facilities as her family scrambled for legal help. These were not isolated mishaps. They occurred amid a deliberate push to expand detention capacity, to terminate Temporary Protected Status for more than half a million Haitians, and to explore agreements with 53 countries\'97many with poor human\u8209 rights records\'97to warehouse deportees beyond U.S. borders.\
\
The law, which might have served as a brake, was instead often turned into an instrument of pressure. Federal prosecutors charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing after he entered an ICE detention center, and Representative LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement during the same incident. Both said they were conducting legitimate oversight. The case against Baraka was quietly dropped after ten days, but McIver was indicted on three counts and pleaded not guilty, framing the episode as political intimidation. In New York, ICE agents arrested city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander when he asked to see a warrant during an arrest he was observing; charges of impeding and assaulting an officer were later dropped. These patterns\'97high\uc0\u8209 profile charges, public denunciations, and then quiet retreats\'97sent a clear message. Those who stand between federal agents and their targets may find themselves in the dock.\
\
Within the Justice Department itself, the line between law and politics blurred further. A whistleblower, former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni, alleged that senior official Emil Bove had urged subordinates to ignore court orders halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that flights could proceed so long as planes left U.S. airspace before written orders were entered. Bove also directed the dismissal of bribery and conspiracy charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, over the objections of career prosecutors, in what a judge later criticized as incompatible with equal justice. At the president\'92s direction, Bove authored memos that led to the firing of prosecutors and FBI agents who had worked on January 6 cases, describing their efforts as a \'93grave national injustice.\'94 Yet this same official appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a nominee for a federal appeals court seat, denying the allegations and defending his record. The nomination itself signaled that conduct once considered disqualifying could now be a credential.\
\
The Supreme Court\'92s immigration and social\uc0\u8209 policy rulings added another layer to this legal landscape. In addition to the third\u8209 country deportation decisions, the Court held that Medicaid beneficiaries lack a private right to sue when states restrict their choice of provider, a ruling that will make it easier for states to exclude Planned Parenthood from Medicaid programs. In cases from Maryland, the Court required schools to allow parents to withdraw children from lessons featuring LGBTQ+ characters on religious grounds, and it upheld a Texas law requiring age verification for access to pornography websites, despite concerns about privacy and free expression. Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent that these decisions could lead schools to strip inclusive content from curricula to avoid litigation, and Justice Elena Kagan raised alarms about barriers to First Amendment\u8209 protected material. Taken together, these rulings shifted the balance toward religious and moral claims that align with the governing coalition and away from broad, enforceable rights for women, LGBTQ+ people, and low\u8209 income patients.\
\
While courts narrowed some avenues of challenge, they also offered moments of resistance. A federal judge in New York blocked the administration\'92s attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants by labeling them an \'93invasion,\'94 and another ordered the government to seek the return of Jordin Melgar\uc0\u8209 Salmeron, deported to El Salvador less than half an hour after a court barred his removal. A district judge halted an executive order terminating collective bargaining rights for more than a million federal employees, preserving union protections while litigation proceeds. Judge Tana Lin issued a partial injunction preventing the administration from withholding $5 billion in electric\u8209 vehicle charger funds from fourteen states, insisting that statutory commitments be honored. These rulings did not reverse the week\'92s structural shifts. They did show that some judges were still willing to confront executive defiance and to insist that orders be obeyed.\
\
Beyond force and law, the week saw a concerted effort to reshape the information environment. The administration authorized the termination of 639 employees at Voice of America, the final phase of a campaign that had already eliminated 1,400 positions at the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Only about 250 staff remained. Officials described VOA as a \'93leftist\'94 propaganda outlet and floated the idea of folding its functions back into the State Department, ending its status as an independent broadcaster. At the same time, the president called on Republicans to defund VOA outright, and he demanded that CNN fire Pentagon correspondent Natasha Bertrand for reporting on the limited impact of the Iran strikes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused the press of \'93cheering against\'94 the president and announced a criminal investigation into the leak of the DIA assessment. A federal judge, meanwhile, criticized the administration for failing to comply with an injunction related to earlier VOA firings, underscoring the tension between judicial orders and executive practice.\
\
The campaign against independent voices extended into civil society and academia. Media Matters for America sued the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that Trump appointees had used regulatory powers to retaliate for the group\'92s reporting on extremist content on social media. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to revoke Harvard University\'92s certification to host foreign students, citing alleged extremism and noncompliance, until a federal judge blocked the move as a threat to free speech. The Justice Department opened an investigation into the University of California\'92s hiring practices, part of a broader pattern of scrutiny directed at universities seen as ideological opponents. At the University of Virginia, President James Ryan resigned under pressure as part of a settlement of a DOJ investigation into the school\'92s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. In each case, the message was similar. Institutions that shape knowledge and civic culture would face legal and financial pressure if they did not align with the administration\'92s preferred narratives.\
\
Public health governance, once a technocratic domain, became another front in this struggle. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had already fired all 17 members of the CDC\'92s vaccine advisory committee. This week, he defended deep budget cuts and office closures in public health and installed eight new members on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, many known for spreading vaccine misinformation. At a House hearing, Representative Kim Schrier accused him of lying to Senator Bill Cassidy about his plans for the committee, and he was forced to retract an accusation that Congressman Frank Pallone\'92s vaccine positions were bought by pharmaceutical money. The reconstituted ACIP then voted, five to one, to restrict the use of thimerosal in flu vaccines, despite the CDC\'92s longstanding conclusion that the preservative is safe and its importance for low\uc0\u8209 cost multidose vials worldwide. A CDC presentation by a former anti\u8209 vaccine activist cited a study that does not exist, claiming long\u8209 term brain effects from thimerosal. At the same time, the administration announced that the United States would pull funding from Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, accusing it of silencing dissent. These moves did not merely change policy. They rewired the advisory and funding structures that anchor trust in vaccines at home and abroad.\
\
The week also brought a sharp example of how economic and surveillance interests intersected with enforcement. Reporting revealed that Stephen Miller, the president\'92s deputy chief of staff and a chief architect of immigration policy, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in Palantir, a company that had just secured a $30 million contract to build a new ICE surveillance platform. Protesters at Palantir\'92s New York office, organized by Planet Over Profit and the immigrant\uc0\u8209 rights group Mijente, blocked the entrance and were arrested for disorderly conduct. At the same time, ProPublica reported that the administration planned to expand DHS authority to prosecute drug traffickers and criminal groups, reducing the role of independent federal prosecutors. These developments illustrated how data systems and prosecutorial power were being drawn into a single orbit, with financial benefits accruing to those closest to the policy decisions.\
\
Amid this tightening of control, there were signs of political countercurrents. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and the first Muslim and South Asian candidate to win the Democratic mayoral primary, defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo. His platform\'97rent freezes, higher taxes on millionaires and corporations, massive investment in affordable housing, free buses, and universal child care\'97challenged the prevailing economic order in the nation\'92s largest city. His victory inspired thousands of progressives to consider running for office. Yet it also triggered a wave of Islamophobic attacks and death threats, now under investigation by the NYPD\'92s hate\uc0\u8209 crimes taskforce, and a call from Representative Andy Ogles to denaturalize and deport him as an \'93antisemitic socialist communist.\'94 The House Homeland Security Committee condemned Ogles\'92 remarks as \'93racist drivel,\'94 but the episode showed how citizenship itself could be wielded as a weapon against dissenting, minority voices.\
\
The week\'92s violence was not confined to rhetoric. In Minnesota, House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband, and their dog were killed in their home by an assailant posing as a police officer, who also wounded another state senator and his wife. The suspect, a self\uc0\u8209 described \'93prepper,\'94 had a hit list of lawmakers. The attack came in a climate where federal agents increasingly wore masks and unmarked clothing during raids and protests, and where the president had deployed Marines and National Guard troops into a major American city to support immigration sweeps. The line between official and quasi\u8209 paramilitary force grew harder to see. When an assassin can successfully impersonate law enforcement to murder elected officials, the safety of public service\'97and the assumption that political disputes will be settled by votes, not bullets\'97comes under direct strain.\
\
Even as these pressures mounted, civil society continued to mobilize. Activists protesting Medicaid cuts were arrested in the Russell Senate Office Building, drawing attention to a reconciliation bill that would enact the largest Medicaid reduction in U.S. history while raising the deficit by trillions. In Los Angeles, mutual\uc0\u8209 aid networks and solidarity funds supported street vendors and families hit by ICE raids. Environmental groups went to court to halt \'93Alligator Alcatraz.\'94 A Honduran mother and her children sued over their arrest at an immigration court, seeking release for a six\u8209 year\u8209 old with leukemia. These efforts did not yet change the trajectory of federal policy. They preserved a record of contestation and offered alternative visions of what public power could be used for.\
\
Looking ahead from this week, several processes were already in motion. The Senate aimed to vote on the budget reconciliation bill by July 4, under pressure from the president and amid a looming funding crisis at DHS driven by overspending on immigration enforcement. The Supreme Court\'92s new limits on nationwide injunctions will shape every future challenge to executive orders, including those on birthright citizenship and deportation. The lawsuits over \'93Alligator Alcatraz,\'94 grant cancellations, and university investigations will test whether courts can still enforce procedural and constitutional boundaries when emergency and security are invoked. Secret talks with Iran over sanctions relief, occurring in the shadow of recent bombings, may alter the regional balance and the domestic narrative of success or failure. And the reconfigured vaccine and preventive\uc0\u8209 services panels will begin to issue recommendations that will either reinforce or erode public trust in medicine for years to come.\
\
By the end of Week 23, the Democracy Clock stands at 7:56 p.m. The movement is modest in minutes, but large in what it represents. War powers have been asserted without effective oversight, and the tools available to courts to halt executive action have been narrowed. Immigration enforcement has become a proving ground for emergency governance, where masked agents, private contractors, and distant camps carry out policies that courts struggle to supervise. Public health, media, and universities\'97institutions that once mediated between power and the public\'97are being repopulated with loyalists or stripped of capacity. At the same time, judges, state officials, and local movements continue to resist, winning injunctions, exposing conflicts of interest, and electing new kinds of leaders.\
\
This week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how different domains\'97foreign war, domestic policing, courts, information, and representation\'97can be aligned around a single logic: concentrate authority, fragment oversight, and treat opposition as suspect. The Civic Covenant, as reflected in the moral floor, is cracked but not shattered. Courts still order deportees returned. Legislatures still debate war powers. Voters still elevate candidates who promise a different path. Yet the tools available to those actors are fewer than they were a week ago, and the costs of using them are higher. At 7:56 p.m., there is still daylight on the horizon, but the shadows of unchecked force and curated memory have grown longer.\
