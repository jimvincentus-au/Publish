\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 17 of Trump\'92s second term traced how a democracy can be hollowed out without a formal emergency. The administration requested 20,000 National Guard troops for immigration enforcement, escalated ICE and highway patrol operations against migrants and their allies, and floated suspending habeas corpus by labeling migration an \'93invasion.\'94 Courts pushed back, with federal judges and a 7\'962 Supreme Court majority insisting on due process in deportation cases and protecting some detained activists. Yet the executive moved aggressively to reshape information and belonging: mass firings at Voice of America, the launch of \'93White House Wire,\'94 campus surveillance directives, and investigations targeting critics like James Comey. Citizenship and refuge were increasingly stratified by race and ideology, even as local elections and modest regulatory work at agencies like the EPA and FDA kept older democratic habits alive. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:51 p.m., but an unseen 0.2\uc0\u8209 minute slide captured the growing load on remaining guardrails.\
