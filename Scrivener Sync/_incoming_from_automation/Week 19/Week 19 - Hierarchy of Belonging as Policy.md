# Week 19: Hierarchy of Belonging as Policy

*A week when law, borders, universities, and media were retooled to sort who counts in the democracy—and who can be safely ignored or expelled.*

The week from May 24 to May 30, 2025, revealed deepening structural challenges to American democracy under the current administration. The Democracy Clock, a calibrated gauge of democratic health, tracks shifts in institutional norms, legal boundaries, and civic trust. Its role is to measure changes in democratic resilience or decline based on observable developments across governance, law, information, and civil society. This week’s events, marked by intensified executive overreach, weaponization of law, and assaults on transparency and dissent, highlight a trajectory toward power consolidation and weakening democratic safeguards. The narrative maintains a measured, analytical tone, documenting facts and interpreting their implications for power and institutional integrity without advocacy or speculation.

At the close of the previous week, the Democracy Clock stood at 9:43 p.m. It advanced by 3.2 minutes to 9:46 p.m. this week, reflecting a significant accumulation of democratic damage. This forward movement is justified by multiple trait shifts showing increased presence of authoritarian tendencies and entrenched difficulty in reversing them. Key among these are unchecked executive power, degradation of transparency laws, impunity for elite financial crimes, and intensified surveillance and stratification of citizenship. These are not isolated incidents but part of a systemic pattern undermining the balance of power, accountability, and the rule of law.

The most prominent development was the continued and unprecedented use of executive authority to bypass legislative and judicial checks. President Trump issued a record 152 executive orders since his return to office, concentrating power in the presidency and sidelining Congress. This included aggressive immigration enforcement operations mandating daily arrest quotas of 3,000 individuals—a tripling of previous targets—raising serious concerns about due process and community impact. The administration also created a new “Office of Remigration” within the State Department, repurposing refugee and migration bureaus to focus on deportations and voluntary returns, signaling a harsh shift in immigration policy. These actions exemplify the trait of executive power operating without effective oversight, which saw a marked increase in presence this week. The difficulty of reversing this trend remains high due to entrenched institutional and doctrinal factors.

Alongside the expansion of executive power was the weaponization of law as a tool of political control rather than a constraint on power. The administration’s use of pardons to shield political allies and wealthy donors from prosecution intensified. Notable pardons included Paul Walczak, a nursing home executive convicted of tax crimes shortly after a large campaign donation, and Scott Jenkins, a former sheriff convicted of bribery and fraud. Reality TV personalities Julie and Todd Chrisley, convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion, also received pardons. These clemency actions undermine the integrity of the justice system and reflect a broader pattern of law serving regime interests. Additionally, executive orders targeted academic institutions, notably Harvard University, revoking its ability to enroll international students and severing federal contracts worth approximately $100 million. These moves pressure universities to conform ideologically or face financial and operational penalties, significantly increasing the presence of the trait concerning suppression of dissent in higher education.

The judiciary remained a contested arena. Several federal judges blocked executive orders violating constitutional protections—such as those targeting law firms linked to politically sensitive investigations and attempts to downsize federal agencies—upholding separation of powers. However, these judicial victories were tempered by the administration’s ongoing attacks on judicial independence. Federal judges expressed concern over threats and intimidation, prompting proposals for an armed security force under judicial control, reflecting a climate of hostility and erosion of judicial autonomy. The appointment of politically motivated prosecutors, such as Ed Martin tasked with investigating Democratic officials, further politicizes the justice system. These dynamics contributed to a rise in the trait measuring erosion of judicial independence through politicized appointments.

Transparency and accountability suffered notable setbacks. The White House ceased publishing official transcripts of President Trump’s speeches, removing a key tool for public scrutiny. The administration filed emergency appeals to block the release of government records to watchdog organizations, limiting oversight. The Federal Communications Commission held closed meetings and initiated multiple reviews of information collection requirements, raising concerns about regulatory transparency. Press freedoms were curtailed through Pentagon-imposed restrictions on media access and threats of legal action against critical news outlets like ABC News. Public media organizations, including NPR and Colorado public radio stations, filed lawsuits challenging retaliatory funding cuts. These developments significantly increased the presence of weakened transparency laws and diminished public accountability.

Surveillance and stratification of citizenship intensified. The administration paused visa interviews for foreign students and mandated comprehensive social media vetting for visa applicants, particularly targeting Chinese students and those with perceived ideological affiliations. Thousands of visas were revoked, and policies prioritized deportations over resettlement, disproportionately affecting immigrant and refugee communities. The Supreme Court allowed the administration to revoke temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua, exposing them to rapid deportation. These actions deepen citizenship stratification by wealth, ideology, and heritage, while expanding surveillance of ordinary citizens. The trait measuring increased surveillance alongside opaque elite crimes remained at a high presence level, reflecting systemic challenges to civil liberties.

Economic policy under the administration continued to reflect coercive and politicized tactics. President Trump announced a 50% tariff on European Union goods and threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products unless manufacturing shifted to the U.S., disrupting international trade relations. He also threatened Walmart over price increases linked to tariffs, exemplifying executive coercion over corporate behavior. The administration resumed collections on defaulted student loans, increasing financial burdens on millions of borrowers. Supply chain disruptions were reported in California, attributed to administration policies, while projections indicated significant declines in international tourism spending. The administration’s close ties with Boeing, including a $1.1 billion non-prosecution agreement following fatal 737 MAX crashes, highlighted the monetization of public tragedy by regime insiders and the impunity of elite financial crimes. These economic developments underscore the entanglement of political power and corporate interests, reinforcing traits related to crony capitalism and elite influence over policy.

Civil society showed both repression and resistance. The administration’s policies led to wrongful detention of U.S. citizens and immigrants, with documented cases of due process violations and racial discrimination. White nationalist groups like Patriot Front continued public marches, while mass protests organized by movements such as Indivisible and the newly formed 50501 movement mobilized millions nationwide in opposition to authoritarian policies. Civil rights organizations condemned executive memoranda attacking the legal profession and the rule of law. Legal challenges by universities, parents, and public media sought to defend academic freedom, educational integrity, and press independence. However, legislative actions such as Utah’s ban on flying LGBTQ+ pride flags at government buildings and schools represented significant attacks on minority rights and visibility. These developments reflect a contested civic space where protest rights are abridged but activism remains vibrant.

Information and memory were arenas of both manipulation and limited restoration. The administration’s cessation of speech transcript publication and imposition of press restrictions diminished transparency. President Trump’s public questioning of President Biden’s health and the dissemination of conspiracy-laden memes aimed to manipulate public perception and rally political bases. The administration’s social media vetting policies for visa applicants raised concerns about surveillance and chilling effects on academic freedom. Conversely, Harvard University’s settlement to transfer early photographs of enslaved people to an African American museum represented a step toward addressing historical injustices and countering erasure. Nonetheless, the broader pattern of disinformation, media intimidation, and curated memory reflects systemic challenges to truthfulness and democratic information flows.

Looking ahead, several risks and decisions warrant attention. Ongoing legal battles over the constitutionality of tariffs, with appeals pending and temporary stays granted, will shape the balance of trade policy authority between the executive and Congress. The Supreme Court’s involvement in immigration cases, including revocation of temporary protected status and challenges to deportation policies, will have profound implications for migrant rights and executive power. The planned Federal Election Commission meeting, closed to the public, raises concerns about transparency in electoral oversight. Additionally, continued mobilization of grassroots resistance movements, including the 50501 and Tesla and Fox Takedown initiatives, signals sustained civic engagement that could influence political dynamics in the near term.

Reflecting on this week’s developments, the Democracy Clock’s advance to 9:46 p.m. marks a significant moment in the current term’s arc. The cumulative effect of executive overreach, legal weaponization, transparency erosion, and intensified surveillance reveals a democracy under strain but not yet broken. The moral character of governance has cracked, with ethical breaches and diminished restraint evident across multiple domains. Yet institutional resistance persists in courts, civil society, and pockets of political opposition. This week exemplifies the fragility of democratic norms when confronted with concentrated power and systemic manipulation. The clock’s movement is a sober reminder that the space for repair narrows as breaches become entrenched, demanding vigilance and concerted efforts to uphold democratic principles.

The official end-of-period time is 9:46 p.m., reflecting a net advance of 3.2 minutes from the previous week. This movement captures broad and deep erosions across the sixty Midnight Traits, with significant increases in traits related to unchecked executive power, weaponized law, weakened transparency, elite impunity, surveillance expansion, and citizenship stratification. The week’s pattern underscores the normalization of lawlessness and the challenges facing institutional resistance. It is a moment of heightened risk but also of potential mobilization, as democratic actors confront accelerating concentration of power and erosion of foundational norms. The Democracy Clock thus records not only the passage of time but the urgency of democratic defense in a period of profound contestation.
