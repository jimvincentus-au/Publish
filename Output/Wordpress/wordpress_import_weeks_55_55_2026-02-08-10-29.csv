<blockquote class=""dc-subtitle""><em>Immigration raids, election seizures, and curated history showed a state using law, force, and narrative to shape who belongs and who may watch.</em></blockquote>

<p>The fifty-fifth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single order or speech. It unfolded as a dense mesh of actions that pressed on the same nerves: who counts as part of the public, who controls the machinery of elections, and who is allowed to watch. Immigration raids, election seizures, funding fights, and museum changes all moved in parallel. Each looked discrete. Together they described a state more willing to use force, law, and narrative to shape the field on which politics occurs.</p>
<p>At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:12 p.m. By the end of this week, it remained at 8:12 p.m., a net shift of zero minutes. The stillness of the dial did not mean stasis. It reflected a balance between deepening structural stress and pockets of resistance that held the line rather than reversing it. Courts blocked some deportations and limited the use of force. State lawmakers advanced voting-rights protections. Yet the executive branch widened its reach into elections, immigration, and information, and the tools of law and administration were used more confidently to punish critics and reward allies. The week’s meaning lay in consolidation, not escalation.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, the federal government’s immigration agenda took the form of a domestic security operation. Under the banner of Operation Metro Surge, ICE and associated agents moved through neighborhoods with rifles, armored vehicles, and chemical agents. In January alone, they killed eight people and intensified enforcement near schools and bus stops, turning ordinary routes to class into zones of fear. In one sweep, agents used tear gas and flashbangs on largely peaceful anti‑ICE protesters, including children, blurring any line between crowd control and punishment. Residents watched as deportation priorities merged with tactics more often associated with war.</p>
<p>The human cost of this posture showed up in detention centers and courtrooms. In Texas, asylum seeker Adrian Conejo Arias and his five‑year‑old son were held until a federal judge ordered their release, rebuking officials for ignoring constitutional principles. Another detainee, Maher Tarabishi, was denied temporary release to attend his disabled son’s funeral, a decision that treated family grief as an afterthought to enforcement. A measles outbreak at the Dilley family detention center prompted calls in Congress to shut it down, underscoring how confinement policies can endanger both detainees and public health. These were not isolated mistakes. They were the predictable outcomes of a system that treats presence without papers as grounds to suspend ordinary compassion.</p>
<p>The reach of enforcement extended beyond borders and into conflict zones. ICE secretly deported Palestinians on a private jet owned by Trump associate Gil Dezer, shackling them for flights to the West Bank. Outsourcing such a coercive function to a politically connected contractor, and routing people into a volatile region, combined due‑process concerns with questions about profit and loyalty. In Minneapolis, federal agents pointed guns and used pepper spray against activists and observers documenting ICE operations, signaling that even watching could carry risk. Allegations in congressional testimony that agents used excessive force against a disabled person, Aliya Rahman, added to a picture of power deployed with little fear of consequence.</p>
<p>Communities did not accept this quietly. Nationwide, protesters organized strikes, marches, and creative actions against ICE, turning city streets and workplaces into sites of resistance. In Minneapolis, some residents set up unauthorized checkpoints to screen vehicles for ICE involvement, a sign of how far trust in official protection had eroded. Local officials also pushed back. Chicago’s mayor issued an executive order directing city police to investigate alleged illegal ICE activity, asserting municipal authority to document and, if necessary, prosecute abuses by federal agents operating in the city. These responses showed civic muscle, but they also revealed how much of the burden of restraint had shifted from federal norms to local improvisation.</p>
<p>Judges provided some of the few formal brakes. In Portland, a federal district judge temporarily barred ICE from using tear gas and projectiles on protesters, placing a legal boundary around tactics that had become routine. The same week, the Oregon Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of more than 1,400 criminal cases because defendants had been denied timely counsel, forcing the state to confront a constitutional crisis in indigent defense. These rulings did not dismantle the enforcement architecture. They functioned as emergency correctives, invoked after harm had already occurred.</p>
<p>Inside the enforcement agencies, personnel moves and policy shifts suggested recalibration rather than retreat. Border commander Gregory Bovino was demoted after controversial shootings and replaced by Tom Homan, a hardline figure whose appointment signaled continuity of approach. President Trump demoted the head of the Border Patrol amid backlash over tactics, but the change kept control within a circle of loyalists. At the Justice Department, leadership downsized the unit responsible for prosecuting law‑enforcement misconduct, cutting two‑thirds of its prosecutors and ordering scaled‑back excessive‑force investigations. The message to officers was clear. Scrutiny would be rarer, and accountability more distant.</p>
<p>While immigration agents were deployed like domestic troops, the administration moved to bring elections further under federal control. In Georgia, the Justice Department and FBI seized 2020 ballots and election records from Fulton County in a high‑profile raid attended by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The presence of the intelligence chief at a local election raid blurred the boundary between national security and domestic politics. Chain‑of‑custody concerns followed, as original ballots left the jurisdiction that had counted them. The operation was framed as an investigation, but it unfolded against a backdrop of persistent claims that the 2020 election had been stolen.</p>
<p>At the same time, DOJ sued twenty‑four states and the District of Columbia to obtain complete, unredacted voter rolls, including sensitive identifiers. These lawsuits went beyond the requirements of existing federal law, seeking data that would enable the creation of a national voter roll. Combined with an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, the suits pointed toward a centralized database that could be used to purge or intimidate voters, especially in communities with less access to documentation. The administration described these moves as efforts to secure elections. Their practical effect was to make it easier to question eligibility and harder to register.</p>
<p>Trump’s rhetoric made the underlying intent more explicit. He called for Republicans to nationalize elections and have ICE surround polling places, urging a federal takeover of what had long been state‑run processes. In speeches and at rallies, he and his allies repeated fraud narratives and spoke of undocumented immigrants as instruments of election theft. At the National Prayer Breakfast, he again claimed that the 2020 election was rigged and suggested that a “person of faith” could not support Democrats, fusing religious identity with partisan loyalty. These statements did not change law on their own. They primed the public to accept extraordinary federal control and the presence of immigration agents at the polls as normal.</p>
<p>Security agencies reinforced the sense that elections were a matter for federal guardians. The FBI summoned state election officials for an unusual midterm briefing, an opaque meeting that raised questions about how threats were being framed and what expectations were being set for local administrators. Meanwhile, the president ordered DHS to expand access to criminal history data and share felony records with foreign partners for border security, broadening the flow of personal information under a security rationale. The same logic that justified sweeping voter‑roll demands and ballot seizures—prevention of fraud and crime—was used to expand data collection and sharing in other domains.</p>
<p>Not all movement ran in one direction. In Mississippi, legislators introduced a state‑level Voting Rights Act with preclearance and language‑access protections, an attempt to rebuild safeguards for minority voters eroded at the federal level. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed California to use a new congressional map expected to add Democratic seats, declining to block a voter‑approved plan that improved representation for some communities. Democracy Docket and similar groups maintained live trackers and analysis on redistricting and election‑rule litigation, giving the public tools to follow complex legal changes. These efforts did not cancel out the federal push to centralize and securitize elections, but they showed that the terrain remained contested.</p>
<p>As elections and immigration were drawn into a security frame, law itself was increasingly used as a weapon against those who documented or challenged these policies. In Minneapolis, federal agents arrested journalists Don Lemon, Georgia Fort, and others while they covered anti‑ICE protests, charging them under civil‑rights statutes and the FACE Act. Laws designed to protect access to clinics and voting were repurposed to criminalize coverage of dissent. The arrests sent a signal to reporters nationwide. Documenting federal operations could bring not only physical risk but felony charges.</p>
<p>The pressure on media extended beyond the streets. After comedian Trevor Noah made comments about Epstein Island during the Grammys, Trump threatened to sue him, using the prospect of civil litigation to chill satire and investigative discussion of elite misconduct. In Washington, ownership of the Washington Post announced plans to cut about one‑third of the newsroom staff, a major blow to one of the country’s leading investigative outlets. At the same time, the Justice Department shrank its police‑misconduct unit, reducing the federal government’s capacity to investigate abusive officers. The combined effect was to weaken both those who report on power and those who are supposed to check it from within.</p>
<p>Universities and the civil service, two pillars of independent expertise, came under direct coercive pressure. Trump sought $1 billion in damages from Harvard University and threatened its research funding over alleged civil‑rights violations, blurring the line between enforcement and political reprisal. The message to other institutions was that federal money could be tied to deference. Days later, he issued a rule reclassifying about 50,000 federal workers to ease firing protections and shifting whistleblower handling from an independent office into individual agencies. This change made it easier to remove career officials who resisted political directives and harder for insiders to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Even where courts still compelled testimony or accountability, they did so in a reactive mode. A federal judge allowed depositions of Elon Musk and former USAID officials in a lawsuit over dismantling the agency, reinforcing that high‑profile figures could be questioned about alleged institutional sabotage. In Louisiana, lawmakers eliminated filing deadlines for childhood sexual‑abuse lawsuits, enabling a large clergy‑abuse settlement and forcing powerful religious institutions to face civil accountability. A former priest in New Orleans was indicted on multiple counts of child rape and molestation. These steps showed that some avenues for justice remained open, but they stood alongside a federal pattern of narrowing who could safely speak and who could safely serve.</p>
<p>The internal structure of the state shifted further toward presidential control. The civil‑service reclassification and weakened whistleblower protections concentrated hiring and firing power in the White House, making loyalty a more important condition of employment. DOJ’s downsizing of its law‑enforcement misconduct unit signaled that certain kinds of wrongdoing would receive less attention. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave conflicting testimony to Congress about tariffs and inflation, denying prior written statements that tariffs were inflationary. His willingness to contradict the record raised doubts about the reliability of official economic narratives.</p>
<p>Bessent also acknowledged that Treasury could be ordered to pay Trump $10 billion over leaked tax returns, confirming that a sitting president was pursuing a civil claim that could yield a massive personal payout from public funds. The possibility that the civil courts might be used to transfer such a sum from the state to the leader underscored how legal tools could serve enrichment as well as redress. When Trump’s aides falsely labeled Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist after a confrontation, the White House retreated only after video showed he was unarmed and public pressure mounted. The episode showed both the ease with which security labels could be misapplied and the limited role of evidence in constraining them.</p>
<p>Foreign and security policy orders illustrated how this concentrated discretion played out beyond U.S. borders. Trump signed an “America First Arms Transfer Strategy” that centralized decisions on weapons exports to advance domestic reindustrialization and geopolitical aims, expanding executive leverage over foreign partners through arms sales. He imposed tariffs on imports from countries trading with Iran, using trade tools as coercive instruments of foreign policy, and then eliminated a 25 percent duty on imports from India after it agreed to stop buying Russian oil. These moves tied economic penalties and rewards to alignment with the administration’s preferences. Letting the New START nuclear treaty with Russia expire without extension removed binding limits on deployed warheads, shifting nuclear policy further into the realm of unconstrained executive choice.</p>
<p>Economic governance itself grew more entangled with private enrichment and foreign money. The United Arab Emirates completed a $500 million investment in a Trump‑linked crypto firm at the same time the administration agreed to sell advanced AI chips to the UAE. Major donor Ken Griffin and others publicly accused the administration of making policy decisions that enriched ruling families and favored firms, reinforcing perceptions that governance and business were fused. In the gambling sector, DraftKings and FanDuel dramatically increased federal political spending, expanded into prediction markets, and lobbied against advertising limits and addiction‑treatment funding. Their multimillion‑dollar donations and lobbying campaigns illustrated how a powerful industry could shape federal rules to protect its growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, the administration withheld federal funds for the $16 billion Gateway rail tunnel while Trump demanded that Dulles Airport and Penn Station be renamed after him. Conditioning critical infrastructure funding on personal naming rights turned a public‑works decision into a vehicle for leader glorification and leverage over states. Treasury’s acknowledgment that it might have to pay Trump billions over leaked tax returns, and the cancellation of roughly 560 federal arts grants totaling more than $27 million, fit into the same pattern: public money and cultural support were used to reward allies, punish critics, and elevate the president’s brand. Ordinary people faced a different economic reality. Employers announced more than 108,000 layoffs in January, the worst January since 2009, and cryptocurrency markets lost over $2 trillion in value since October, heavily impacting investors and Trump‑linked holdings alike.</p>
<p>Beneath these headline shifts, the fiscal and regulatory ground tilted further toward capital. In North Carolina, legislative leaders failed to pass a state budget, leaving key social programs unfunded, while pursuing a corporate tax rate cut to zero. Eliminating corporate income tax would shift the fiscal burden away from corporations and constrain future resources for education, health, and safety nets. At the federal level, agencies like EPA, FDA, FCC, OSHA, and others continued to issue routine regulatory notices on pesticides, controlled substances, safety standards, data collections, and environmental plans. The administrative state still set technical standards that shaped economic activity and public welfare, even as its top layers were pulled toward private interests.</p>
<p>The struggle over who belongs and whose story counts ran through the week’s cultural and informational developments. At the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump used a bipartisan religious event to question Democrats’ faith and repeat rigged‑election claims, casting opponents as both fraudulent and faithless. He posted a racist video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, later removed after criticism, amplifying dehumanizing tropes from the platform of a former president. Stephen Miller, serving as White House deputy chief of staff, publicly rejected Haitians living legally in Ohio as part of the community, promoting a vision of citizenship stratified by origin and inviting policies that treat immigrant labor as politically rightless.</p>
<p>State and federal actors also moved to reshape public memory. The National Park Service, under administration direction, removed an exhibit on enslaved people at Independence National Historical Park, erasing a display about slavery at the President’s House and reorienting the site toward a more celebratory narrative. In Florida, legislators advanced a bill to ban the term “West Bank” in schools and state agencies, mandating “Judea and Samaria” instead. By legislating terminology about a contested territory, they imposed a particular geopolitical narrative in public education and administration. Vaccine and curriculum fights added to the picture. Florida Republicans advanced a bill expanding vaccine exemptions for schoolchildren on conscience grounds, while a federal advisory committee began reevaluating all U.S. vaccine recommendations under leadership skeptical of mandates. These moves risked outbreaks and eroded evidence‑based public‑health education, nudging curricula toward ideology and individualism over civic responsibility.</p>
<p>The information environment around elite misconduct and state power was equally contested. The Justice Department released millions of pages of Epstein investigation files with heavy redactions and long delays, complying with transparency law in form while undermining its spirit. Redaction failures exposed victims’ names, and thousands of files were then pulled from public release, re‑closing records that had briefly been open. Congress responded by demanding unredacted files under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and securing Bill and Hillary Clinton’s agreement to testify under threat of contempt. Media outlets, including the Guardian, published documents revealing Epstein’s communications with CIA Director William J. Burns and other global elites, raising questions about vetting and access.</p>
<p>The pattern suggested selective transparency. Survivors’ privacy was compromised while many elite‑related records remained obscured. Trump’s threat to sue Trevor Noah over Epstein commentary fit this pattern, as did the broader reluctance to fully document potential crimes by well‑connected donors and allies. At the same time, Louisiana’s elimination of filing deadlines for childhood sexual‑abuse lawsuits and the resulting clergy‑abuse settlement showed that some jurisdictions were expanding access to justice in long‑hidden abuse cases. Senator Ron Wyden’s cryptic public letter to the CIA director flagged serious but classified concerns about agency activities, using limited disclosure to preserve a record for future accountability. The National Archives invited public comment on proposed federal records schedules, a small but real effort to safeguard archival integrity in an era when government archives could be sealed, sanitized, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Congress itself oscillated between high‑stakes theater and partial oversight. A dispute over DHS funding produced a partial government shutdown, using essential operations as bargaining chips in conflicts over immigration enforcement. Lawmakers then passed and Trump signed a $1.2 trillion appropriations bill that ended the shutdown and restored most federal operations, while leaving DHS on a short leash with only a brief funding extension. Democratic leaders outlined demands tying DHS money to warrants, anti‑profiling rules, and other safeguards, seeking to use the power of the purse to reshape ICE practices. In parallel, House committees pursued the Epstein investigation with a mix of genuine inquiry and partisan framing, compelling testimony from high‑profile figures while risking the conversion of oversight into spectacle.</p>
<p>Across these domains, the week’s developments shared a common structure. Authority was exercised through existing tools—executive orders, lawsuits, raids, funding decisions, curriculum bills—rather than through open breaks with law. Immigration agencies were used as domestic security forces. Elections were recast as security problems to be managed from the center. Law and funding were deployed against journalists, universities, and cultural institutions. Economic policy intertwined with private enrichment and foreign money. Public memory was edited in museums and classrooms. Courts, local officials, and civil society responded with injunctions, ordinances, protests, and new statutes, but mostly in reaction to moves already made.</p>
<p>The Democracy Clock did not move this week because these patterns were not new. They represented a deepening of trajectories already in place: executive power operating with less effective oversight, law serving as a weapon more than a limit, wealth buying not only speech but law, and memory curated by those in office. Rights remained on paper. Elections were still scheduled. Newspapers still published. Yet using these channels now required more persistence and carried greater cost, especially for those outside the circles of wealth and power. The week’s significance lay in how much of this felt routine, and how much of the work of defense had shifted to courts, cities, and scattered statehouses trying to hold a line that the center no longer maintained.</p>

Simultaneously, the Trump administration’s multi-pronged effort to nationalize election control—DOJ lawsuits for voter rolls, FBI raids on Fulton County, proof-of-citizenship orders, SAVE Act pushes, and open talk of ICE at polling places—exerted major pressure on voter access and state control (traits 1, 4, 11, 45, 52). Executive moves to strip civil service protections, weaponize funding (Harvard, Gateway project, arts grants), and monetize foreign and crypto ties entrenched crony capitalism and unchecked executive power (traits 1, 7, 16, 22, 24, 38).

<p><em>Immigration raids, election seizures, and curated history showed a state using law, force, and narrative to shape who belongs and who may watch.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic stress, centered on three converging fronts: immigration enforcement as a domestic security tool, federal encroachment on elections, and the fusion of public power with private enrichment. ICE and DHS operations in Minneapolis, Portland, schools, and detention centers—paired with lethal force, child detentions, secretive deportation flights, and aggressive tactics against protesters and journalists—pushed traits 9, 11, 22, 41, 42, and 50 sharply toward authoritarian policing. Simultaneously, the Trump administration’s multi-pronged effort to nationalize election control—DOJ lawsuits for voter rolls, FBI raids on Fulton County, proof-of-citizenship orders, SAVE Act pushes, and open talk of ICE at polling places—exerted major pressure on voter access and state control (traits 1, 4, 11, 45, 52). Executive moves to strip civil service protections, weaponize funding (Harvard, Gateway project, arts grants), and monetize foreign and crypto ties entrenched crony capitalism and unchecked executive power (traits 1, 7, 16, 22, 24, 38). Countervailing forces—federal courts blocking TPS termination and ICE tear gas, state-level voting-rights bills, redistricting wins, and mass protests—registered as meaningful but outweighed defensive responses rather than structural repair.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order directing city police to investigate alleged illegal ICE activity: The order empowered local police to document and pursue potential crimes by federal immigration agents, asserting municipal authority over federal operations and strengthening accountability for abuses of power in immigration enforcement. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump retreated from aides’ false description of Alex Pretti as a domestic terrorist after video evidence emerged: The White House’s reversal under public and bipartisan pressure showed that independent evidence and scrutiny can still constrain executive narrative control over lethal law-enforcement incidents. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump announced the Freedom 250 Grand Prix in Washington, D.C., as part of the US semiquincentennial: By centering a large state-backed spectacle around patriotic themes, the administration used symbolic events to shape national identity and divert attention from contentious governance issues. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump demoted the head of the Border Patrol amid backlash over immigration enforcement tactics: Reassigning the Border Patrol chief signaled executive willingness to reshuffle security leadership in response to public outrage while retaining centralized control over aggressive immigration operations. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for federal voter registration: The order sought to federalize voter eligibility rules and risked disenfranchising millions lacking specific documents, shifting power over election access from states toward the executive branch. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump threatened Harvard University with a $1bn civil-rights damages claim and funding pressure: Using federal civil-rights enforcement and research funding as leverage against a critical university blurred the line between legitimate oversight and coercive use of state power to shape academic governance. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump issued a rule to ease firing protections for tens of thousands of federal workers: Reclassifying about 50,000 civil servants to make them easier to dismiss and weakening independent whistleblower channels concentrated personnel power in the presidency and undermined a neutral professional bureaucracy. (2026-02-05)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump publicly called for nationalizing control of elections in selected jurisdictions: Trump’s repeated calls for federal takeover of state-run elections challenged constitutional allocations of authority and signaled an ambition to centralize control over voting infrastructure. (2026-02-04)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump used the National Prayer Breakfast to question the faith of Democrats and repeat false election claims: Invoking religious identity at a bipartisan event to delegitimize political opponents and insist the 2020 election was rigged fused partisan loyalty with faith and eroded shared acceptance of electoral outcomes. (2026-02-06)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing an America First Arms Transfer Strategy: The order centralized decisions on arms exports around domestic industrial and geopolitical priorities, expanding executive discretion to use weapons sales as a tool of foreign influence and economic policy. (2026-02-06)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing tariffs on countries trading with Iran: By authorizing tariffs on third countries that trade with Iran, the administration broadened unilateral economic coercion powers, intertwining trade policy with security designations under executive control. (2026-02-06)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump issued an executive order eliminating additional duties on imports from India after policy concessions: Lifting a 25% tariff on Indian imports in exchange for India’s agreement to stop buying Russian oil showed how the executive can trade tariff relief for foreign policy alignment without direct legislative input. (2026-02-06)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump issued an executive order expanding DHS access to criminal records for border and immigration enforcement: The order deepened data-sharing between federal criminal databases and immigration systems, strengthening executive capacity to screen, exclude, or deport noncitizens based on broad security rationales. (2026-02-06)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>U.S. Senate advanced and approved government funding bills while debating ICE reforms: Senators moved spending bills to avert a shutdown and passed a funding package with a DHS stopgap, using appropriations leverage to press for oversight and conduct rules on ICE operations. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>U.S. Department of Justice released millions of pages of Epstein investigation files with major delays and redaction failures: DOJ’s late, partially withheld, and error-ridden Epstein disclosures—exposing victims while shielding many powerful figures—undermined statutory transparency and trust in equal application of justice. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>U.S. Congress allowed a partial government shutdown over DHS funding and then passed a $1.2tn appropriations bill: Budget brinkmanship over immigration enforcement produced a short shutdown before Congress and Trump enacted a large appropriations law, illustrating how core services are used as leverage in policy disputes. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>U.S. Senate narrowly rejected Bernie Sanders’s amendment to cut ICE funding and redirect it to Medicaid: The failed 49–51 vote showed growing but insufficient congressional support for shifting resources from immigration enforcement toward health care, clarifying institutional priorities in federal spending. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ordered the release of asylum seeker Adrian Conejo Arias and his five-year-old son from detention: By freeing a detained family and criticizing officials for ignoring constitutional principles, the court asserted judicial checks on immigration enforcement and protected due process for vulnerable migrants. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez denied Minnesota’s request to halt Operation Metro Surge immigration raids: The ruling upheld a large federal enforcement surge over state and city objections, reinforcing federal primacy in immigration operations despite local concerns about deaths and community harm. (2026-01-31)</li>
<li>Federal appellate chief judge Jeffrey Sutton dismissed a DOJ-filed judicial misconduct complaint against Judge James Boasberg: Rejecting DOJ officials’ complaint over deportation litigation signaled internal judicial resistance to political pressure on judges handling contentious immigration cases. (2026-02-01)</li>
<li>Federal courts in Washington, D.C. temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status for Haitians: Judges halted DHS plans to strip TPS from hundreds of thousands of Haitians, emphasizing likely legal violations and ideological bias, and preserving lawful status while litigation proceeds. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>U.S. Department of Justice pursued error-filled lawsuits against states and D.C. to obtain complete voter rolls: DOJ’s suits demanding sensitive voter data, despite weak statutory basis and drafting errors, used federal litigation to pressure states toward a national voter roll, straining election federalism. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>U.S. Department of Justice appealed a ruling blocking cancellation of $2.2bn in Harvard research grants: Challenging a court decision that protected university research funding extended the administration’s effort to use federal grants as leverage in a broader conflict over campus governance and speech. (2026-02-03)</li>
<li>U.S. Department of Justice faced judicial criticism over noncompliance with court orders in immigration cases: A DOJ attorney’s request to be held in contempt and remarks about a broken system highlighted internal strain and raised questions about the department’s ability or willingness to obey court mandates. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>National Archives and Records Administration invited public comment on proposed federal records disposition schedules: By seeking input on how agencies may destroy or retain records, NARA maintained a participatory process that helps safeguard archival transparency and historical accountability. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>House Oversight Committee leadership secured Bill and Hillary Clinton’s agreement to testify in its Epstein investigation: The Clintons’ decision to comply with subpoenas under threat of contempt underscored Congress’s formal oversight powers while also reflecting the partisan framing of high-profile inquiries. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>North Carolina General Assembly leadership failed to pass a 2026 state budget amid political calculations, causing service gaps: The budget stalemate, driven partly by electoral strategy, left teachers without raises and threatened health and welfare programs, showing how legislative inaction can erode basic governance. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>Georgia state and local officials moved to challenge the FBI’s seizure of 2020 election documents from Fulton County: By contesting a federal raid that took original ballots and records beyond prior court limits, county officials sought to defend state control over election materials and the integrity of evidence. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>Georgia prosecutors appealed dismissal of RICO charges against Cop City protesters: The appeal aimed to revive expansive racketeering charges against activists, testing how far state authorities can stretch criminal law to deter organized protest movements. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>Coalition of immigration advocates and U.S. citizens sued Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department over a broad visa ban: The lawsuit challenged a suspension of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries as discriminatory and unlawful, using the courts to contest sweeping executive control over migration. (2026-02-02)</li>
<li>U.S. District Judge Michael Simon considered and then granted temporary limits on federal agents’ use of force at Portland protests: By weighing and issuing a restraining order on ICE’s use of teargas and projectiles, the court intervened to protect protest rights and set boundaries on federal crowd-control tactics.
