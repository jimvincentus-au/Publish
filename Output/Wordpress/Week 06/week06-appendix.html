<h1>Week 6 Appendix: Bureaucracy as Patronage Engine</h1>
<p><em>A week of quiet decrees turned the civil service, immigration system, and information sphere into instruments of loyalty, wealth, and curated memory.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The executive moved aggressively to centralize fiscal and personnel control (DOGE orders, mass-firing memos, NIH and USAID funding freezes), while simultaneously politicizing core coercive institutions: the FBI and U.S. attorney corps were openly redefined as the president’s personal instruments, and senior military and JAG leadership were purged and replaced with loyalists. Civil service protections were systematically dismantled through reclassification orders, buyouts, probationary firings, and agency-specific purges at NOAA, NIH, SSA, USAID, and Education. Parallel to this, the administration escalated its campaign against independent media and information autonomy—barring AP and Reuters, seizing control of the press pool, conditioning access on compliance with a fabricated geographic renaming, and amplifying AI-driven propaganda. Foreign policy shifted decisively toward alignment with Russia and transactional, oligarchic arrangements (Ukraine minerals deal, Gaza redevelopment, crypto-linked enforcement retreats), eroding the U.S. role as a rule-of-law democracy. Courts provided some important brakes on data grabs, refugee and DEI bans, and mass firings, but these were offset by politicized rulings and regulatory impunity for major donors. The net effect is strong structural pressure toward a patronage-autocracy resting on a hollowed-out state, captured law enforcement, and managed information space.</p>
