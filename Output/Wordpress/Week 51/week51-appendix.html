<h1>Week 51 Appendix: War, Oil, and Enforcement as Rule</h1>
<p><em>A near-static clock masks a week when war powers, immigration raids, and economic policy were fused into a single project of personalized executive rule.</em></p>
<p>This was a rupture week in which the presidency functioned as an almost unbound personal regime, using war, oil, and immigration enforcement as core tools. The unilateral abduction of Nicolás Maduro and announced seizure of Venezuelan oil, without congressional authorization, drove severe pressure on executive constraint, rule of law, and global-democracy norms. Simultaneously, an extraordinary immigration surge in Minnesota—culminating in the killing of Renee Nicole Good and other shootings—showed federal security forces operating as instruments of political will, with the FBI shutting out state investigators and senior officials branding a dead legal observer a “domestic terrorist.” Across domains, the administration fused economic and foreign policy to reward insiders, from Citgo’s fire-sale acquisition to promises of “total safety” for oil majors. Information control and revisionism intensified: January 6 was recast as patriotic, Epstein files were withheld in defiance of statute, and coordinated disinformation surrounded the Minneapolis shooting. Countervailing forces existed—Senate war-powers pushback, impeachment articles against DHS, mass protests, and some corporate and legislative defenses of democratic norms—but they were reactive to a concentrated burst of authoritarian-style executive assertion.</p>
