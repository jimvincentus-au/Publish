Gabbard later claimed her testimony was taken out of context and aligned her stance with Trump's, stating that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months.

The decision, delivered in a 6-3 majority opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, supports the state's interest in protecting minors from explicit content. The law mandates that users provide government-issued identification or transactional data to access sites with significant pornographic content. The ruling follows a legal challenge by the Free Speech Coalition, which argued the law infringed on adults' rights and posed privacy risks. The decision sets a precedent for similar laws in other states.",

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, partially stayed the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.
