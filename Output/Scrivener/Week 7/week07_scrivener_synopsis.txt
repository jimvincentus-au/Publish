Week 7 of Trump’s second term registered only a half‑minute shift on the Democracy Clock, holding at 7:52 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked a deepening of habits. The administration widened unilateral control over foreign aid and cyber posture, bypassing Congress on a $4 billion emergency arms sale to Israel, attempting to impound Ukraine aid, and ordering Cyber Command to stand down against Russia. Courts forced compliance on spending and some firings, yet impeachment threats and targeted executive orders against judges, law firms, and prosecutors signaled growing hostility to legal limits. Inside the state, mass layoffs, buyouts, and loyalist appointments hollowed Education, Social Security, VA, CFPB, USPS, and foreign‑aid bodies, shifting capacity toward privatization and patronage. A new crypto reserve, halted anti–money laundering rules, and a quashed fraud case fused public policy with donor enrichment. Immigration crackdowns, anti‑DEI offensives, and campus funding threats hardened hierarchies of belonging and speech. Information channels and archives were curated to fit regime narratives. Resistance from courts, inspectors, universities, and street protests slowed but did not reverse the drift.
