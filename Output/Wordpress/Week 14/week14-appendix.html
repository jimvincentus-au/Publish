<h1>Week 14 Appendix: Universities and Borders as Levers</h1>
<p><em>A near-still Democracy Clock masks a week in which the White House tightened control over courts, campuses, and civil rights while testing the limits of law.</em></p>
<p>This was a structurally heavy week of democratic backsliding, centered on aggressive executive overreach, weaponization of law, and systematic attacks on pluralistic institutions. The administration escalated its campaign against universities through massive funding freezes, coercive conditions on academic governance, and new accreditation and DEI–rollback orders, pushing Trait 44 (universities pressured to suppress dissent) into crisis territory. Immigration enforcement and detention policy hardened further: closure of key oversight offices, wrongful detentions of citizens, politicized targeting of student activists, and contempt findings over deportations collectively deepened Traits 4, 9, 47, and 1. Civil-rights enforcement was structurally rewritten via the disparate-impact order and disability/Medicaid cuts, entrenching stratified citizenship and inequality. Inside the state, Interior and State Department restructurings, DOGE’s opaque data practices, and Musk/Hegseth’s behavior signaled accelerating capture and politicization of the civil service and security apparatus. Yet courts and civil society mounted notable resistance: multiple federal rulings blocked sanctuary-city defunding, voter-document mandates, and deportations; Harvard and state AGs sued; and nationwide protests and university presidents’ statements showed organized pushback. Overall, the week’s net pressure strongly favored authoritarian consolidation despite pockets of institutional resilience.</p>
