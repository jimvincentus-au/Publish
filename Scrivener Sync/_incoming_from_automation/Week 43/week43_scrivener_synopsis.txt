In Week 43 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock stayed fixed at 11:26 p.m., but only because its mechanism rounds slowly. Beneath that apparent stillness, a dense pattern of incremental erosion hardened into habit. The presidency used clemency to shield election subverters and financial allies, while federal prosecutors targeted critics and sidelined internal watchdogs. The longest government shutdown ended only after the administration had tested how far it could use food assistance and unpaid federal labor as leverage, normalizing emergency as a governing tool. Agencies meant to protect consumers and housing were recast as instruments of crony capitalism, even as 50‑year mortgages and homelessness cuts shifted risk onto the public. Information itself became contested terrain: economic data were withheld, Epstein files were selectively released or buried behind new investigations, and journalists faced smears. Courts and communities won scattered victories, but the week’s through-line was consolidation—of power, impunity, and narrative control.
