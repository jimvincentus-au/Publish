\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 49 Appendix: Files As Instruments of Power\
\
This week shows an executive increasingly willing to defy legal constraints while building a punitive, loyalty-based state. The most intense structural pressure falls on transparency and archival integrity, as the Justice Department\'92s noncompliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, selective redactions, document removals, and politicized messaging collectively normalize lawbreaking to shield elites. Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is scaled up into a semi-permanent infrastructure of mass detention and militarized control, with record ICE detentions, warehouse-style facilities, National Guard deployments to cities, and dehumanizing official rhetoric. Agencies are repurposed to serve ideological and economic allies: environmental and renewable energy programs are dismantled in favor of fossil interests; the VA is ordered to end abortion care; DOJ sues to preempt local gun regulation while dropping crypto probes amid conflicts of interest. Civil service and diplomacy are hollowed out through politicized recalls and job cuts, while symbolic projects like the Trump-Kennedy Center and Trump-class battleships redirect public resources toward personal glorification. Courts and some legislators push back\'97blocking Guard deployments, funding retaliation, and the Kennedy Center name change\'97but the net effect is a sharp tilt toward unaccountable, personalized executive power.\

Information, Memory and Manipulation\

\
8. CBS News leadership under Bari Weiss pulled or postponed a vetted 60 Minutes segment on migrant transfers to El Salvador\'92s megaprison: Yanking a completed investigation into abusive deportations, which then aired abroad, raised concerns about political pressure and self-censorship in mainstream media. \'97 2025-12-21\
\
9. Vice President J.D. Vance and Turning Point USA used a major conservative summit to promote narratives about movement purity and Christian national identity: Messaging at AmericaFest framed the U.S. as a Christian nation and debated movement boundaries, shaping ideological narratives that influence future political mobilization. \'97 2025-12-21\
\
10. President Donald Trump posted that filmmaker Rob Reiner\'92s death was linked to his political opposition: Speculating that a critic\'92s death was politically motivated blurred fact and insinuation, contributing to a climate where personal tragedies are weaponized for partisan narratives. \'97 2025-12-20\

\
14. President Donald Trump promoted a conspiracy video alleging COVID-19 enabled Democrats to steal the 2020 election: Amplifying a QAnon-style narrative about the pandemic and election fraud entrenched disinformation that undermines trust in both electoral integrity and public health institutions. \'97 2025-12-25\
\
15.

\
18. U.S. Department of Justice failed to investigate a 1996 report about Epstein\'92s abuse and image theft: Ignoring an early, detailed complaint about Epstein allowed years of further abuse and raised questions about whether powerful connections influenced investigative inaction. \'97 2025-12-21\
\
19. U.S. Department of Justice sued Washington DC to invalidate its AR-15-style weapons ban: Framing local gun restrictions as unconstitutional positioned federal legal narratives in favor of expansive gun rights, influencing public understanding of the Second Amendment. \'97 2025-12-22\
