      "summary": "The Trump administration has deployed federal forces to Portland, Oregon, in response to ongoing protests against its hardline immigration policies. This move comes despite opposition from local leaders and a coalition of 17 mayors in the state. Oregon's Attorney General, Dan Rayfield, has filed a lawsuit to challenge the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon National Guard. A federal judge is set to hear arguments on whether to temporarily block the troop deployment. The deployment is part of a broader pattern of federal interventions in Democrat-run cities across the US.",
