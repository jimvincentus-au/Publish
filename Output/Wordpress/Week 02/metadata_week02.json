In the background, a filing box labeled with a date is half-empty, its contents replaced by a glossy commemorative monument figurine. Painterly, realistic style, rich shadows and subdued light.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit panorama of Washington, D.C., with the Capitol and federal office blocks in semi-darkness, many windows blacked out, while a giant, old-fashioned clock in the sky shows its hands edging toward night. In the foreground, filing cabinets and servers are being wheeled out by shadowy figures in suits and tactical gear, papers fluttering away. Protesters and lawyers stand behind temporary barricades, holding folders and court filings rather than signs. The mood is tense and painterly, with realistic detail and muted, ominous colors."

  "long_synopsis": "In the second week of Trump\u2019s second term, the Democracy Clock moved from 7:39 p.m. to 7:45 p.m., a 5.4\u2011minute lurch toward democratic erosion. The week read less like improvisation than execution of a plan. Mass pardons for January 6 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, combined with firings of DOJ prosecutors and FBI officials, closure of co\u2011defendant cases, and removal of the January 6 prosecutions database to turn law into a shield for regime allies and a warning to investigators. Inside the state, inspectors general, labor\u2011rights enforcers, and civil servants were purged or stripped of protections, while Musk\u2011linked aides centralized personnel data. Immigration and citizenship policy shifted toward a tiered order enforced through raids in schools and churches, Guant\u00e1namo expansion, TPS rollbacks, and an attempted end to birthright citizenship. Parallel DEI and LGBTQ+ rollbacks, curriculum directives, and archival deletions curated information and memory. Courts, states, and civil society fought back with injunctions and lawsuits, but mostly in reactive, fragmented fashion.",
