Week 11 of Trump’s second term was less a single rupture than a saturation event. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:56 p.m., inching only 0.4 minutes deeper into danger, yet the underlying machinery shifted. Trump declared a national emergency to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, centralizing trade and taxing power in the presidency while markets slid and favored sectors won exemptions. Simultaneously, mass layoffs and restructurings at HHS, EPA, USAID, and Social Security hollowed public health, environmental, and foreign aid capacity, with Elon Musk’s extra‑legal DOGE shaping personnel and data access. Immigration and security tools were turned against activists, students, and migrants through arbitrary criteria and propaganda, even as courts sporadically intervened. Universities, museums, DC, and Maine were disciplined through funding and policing orders, while media and memory came under pressure via FCC probes, defamation suits, Smithsonian content edits, and sealed records. State attorneys general, judges, unions, and a 25‑hour Senate speech mounted resistance, but largely in reactive, fragmented fashion.
