\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 45 of Trump\'92s second term shows how authoritarian drift can deepen even when the Democracy Clock barely moves. The public time remains at 7:59 p.m., with only a 0.1\uc0\u8209 minute shift toward midnight, as executive power expands through secret war memos, sweeping emergency energy orders, and plans to erase a predecessor\'92s executive actions. The Justice Department is hollowed out where it might check power and sharpened where it can target opponents, while broad pardons and dropped election cases signal impunity for regime allies. Military and security forces edge further into partisan and domestic roles, from Caribbean strikes to National Guard patrols in Washington and investigations of dissenting lawmakers. Immigration and citizenship policy harden into a hierarchy of belonging, and economic and health data are manipulated or withheld. Yet courts sanction Trump, block gerrymanders, and activists force federal agents off North Carolina streets, offering narrow but real resistance that keeps the clock\'92s hand from jumping forward.\
