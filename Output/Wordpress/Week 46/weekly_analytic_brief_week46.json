  "summary": "This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic erosion, centered on three converging axes: weaponization of law, racialized immigration crackdown, and normalization of extrajudicial violence. The presidency and Justice Department were repeatedly used to shield elites and allies (mass pardons of corrupt officials and foreign traffickers, DOJ memo stripping PREA protections for LGBTQ+ prisoners, politicized targeting of antifa and left groups) while punishing opponents and vulnerable populations. Immigration policy shifted toward de facto group-based exclusion: nationwide pauses on asylum and Afghan processing, adjudicative holds and re-reviews for 19 \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries, expanded travel bans, and aggressive ICE raids that ignored court orders and due process. In parallel, the Hegseth/Bradley boat-strike campaign and new Pacific strike entrenched a doctrine of permanent, legally dubious \u201cwar\u201d on narco-traffickers, with Congress scrambling to reassert oversight after the fact. Information control and chaos politics intensified through a White House media-enemies site, suppression of economic data, and far-right-inflected national security strategy. There were pockets of resistance\u2014federal courts blocking warrantless immigration arrests, rulings against illegal U.S. attorney appointments, and mandated Epstein-file releases\u2014but these gains were outweighed by systemic moves toward impunity, stratified citizenship, and militarized governance.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Law as an instrument of impunity and punishment: pardons for corrupt elites and foreign traffickers, DOJ memos gutting protections, and selective prosecutions show law increasingly shields insiders while targeting opponents and marginalized groups.",
    "Racialized immigration and citizenship rollback: sweeping asylum pauses, country-based holds, expanded travel bans, and ICE abuses\u2014often in defiance of court orders\u2014move the system toward heritage-based stratification of legal status.",
    "Normalization of extrajudicial force: the narco-boat strike campaign, new lethal strikes, and Hegseth\u2019s open contempt for the laws of war embed a quasi-permanent, weakly supervised military campaign with blurred legal authority.",
    "Information warfare and managed opacity: a federal media-shaming site, preferential access rules, halted economic indicators, and far-right security doctrine for Europe combine to distort public understanding and disable accountability.",
    "Crony capitalism and foreign entanglements: golden-share control of US Steel, Pentagon loans to Trump-linked firms, Kushner and Witkoff\u2019s conflicted diplomacy, and Trump-family crypto ventures fuse state power with private enrichment."
