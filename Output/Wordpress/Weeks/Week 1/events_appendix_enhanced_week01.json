      "summary": "Former President Donald Trump issued pardons to more than 1,500 individuals convicted in connection with the January 6 insurrection. This action, one of his first in office, included those convicted of violent offenses and several leaders of the Capitol attack. The Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the pardons, stating they undermine the rule of law and public safety. The pardons contradict statements made by Vice President JD Vance, who opposed pardoning those responsible for the violence.",
