Week 13 of Trump’s second term marks a visible turn from episodic abuses to an integrated method of rule. The administration openly defied a unanimous Supreme Court order to return Kilmar Ábrego García, outsourced detainees to El Salvador’s mega‑prison, and floated sending U.S. citizens there, testing whether courts can still bind the executive. Immigration law and civil‑rights machinery were repurposed to punish speech and redraw the boundaries of belonging: Palestinian and Turkish students were detained or deported over Gaza advocacy, visas were stripped from hundreds of international students, and a sweeping proof‑of‑citizenship voting order aligned with the House’s Save Act to narrow the electorate under the banner of “integrity.” Universities, led by Harvard, faced funding freezes, tax‑exempt threats, and visa leverage for refusing to police dissent. Simultaneously, transparency tools vanished, Covid.gov was rewritten into propaganda, and tariffs triggered market chaos that Trump‑linked ventures sought to monetize. Courts, some state officials, and civil society pushed back, but the Democracy Clock’s eight‑minute jump to 10:19 p.m. reflects how executive defiance, economic opportunism, and stratified citizenship are now working in concert.
