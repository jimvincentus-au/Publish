\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 8 Appendix: Citizenship as Sorting Mechanism\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and a sharp turn toward exclusionary citizenship and weaponized law. Trump and Musk\'92s DOGE apparatus drive mass firings, lease terminations, and deep cuts to education, science, health, and foreign aid, while courts begin to push back\'97ordering reinstatement of tens of thousands of workers and forcing transparency from DOGE and EPA. Immigration powers are overtly used against political speech, with Mahmoud Khalil\'92s detention becoming a central test of whether dissent by non\uc0\u8209 citizens is tolerated at all. Simultaneously, the administration seeks to end birthright citizenship and normalize emergency authorities, structurally stratifying legal status. Internationally, the US abandons climate leadership, undermines Ukraine and NATO, and escalates trade wars, eroding alliances and global democratic norms. Information control intensifies through record destruction orders, meeting cancellations, and manipulation of DOGE data, even as independent outlets and courts expose discrepancies. Civil society mobilizes\'97science marches, anti\u8209 oligarchy tours, Tesla protests, and Trump Tower sit\u8209 ins\'97but faces criminalization and surveillance. Overall, the week exerts strong negative pressure on at least half the core safeguards of liberal democracy, with only modest countervailing judicial and civic resistance.\

4. House Republicans passed a Trump\uc0\u8209 backed funding bill cutting non\u8209 defense programs while boosting military spending (2025-03-11): Advancing a partisan spending plan that shifts resources from social programs to defense reflected a legislature increasingly ratifying executive priorities rather than negotiating balanced budgets.\
\
5. House of Representatives passed a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown (2025-03-12): The House\'92s approval of a temporary funding measure kept agencies open but locked in controversial cuts and freezes, trading long\uc0\u8209 term policy leverage for short\u8209 term continuity.\

Judge Tanya Chutkan and Judge Christopher Cooper ordered DOGE to produce internal records and comply with transparency laws (2025-03-11): Requiring Musk\'92s government efficiency unit to respond to discovery and FOIA\uc0\u8209 like obligations pushed back against efforts to keep a powerful quasi\u8209 agency outside normal accountability channels.\
\

Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift injunctions blocking its birthright citizenship order (2025-03-13): Seeking emergency high\uc0\u8209 court relief to implement a sweeping change to citizenship law highlighted reliance on aggressive litigation to expand executive authority over constitutional questions.\
\
21.

Economic Structure\
\
1.

\
2. Trump administration slashed USAID programs addressing root causes of the drug trade and community violence (2025-03-08): Cutting prevention\uc0\u8209 oriented aid undermined long\u8209 term strategies to reduce crime and migration pressures, favoring short\u8209 term savings over structural stability.\
\
3.

\
7. Trump administration cut over $1 billion from USDA local food programs for schools and food banks (2025-03-11): Eliminating support for local food purchases reduced nutrition access for children and low\uc0\u8209 income families and harmed small producers reliant on these markets.\

\
9.

\
10. President Trump threatened a 200% tariff on EU wines and champagnes in retaliation for EU whiskey tariffs (2025-03-13): Using steep, targeted tariffs as leverage in a trade dispute risked harming domestic industries and appeared to intersect with the president\'92s own business interests.\
