In Week 5 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been emerging snapped into clearer focus. The presidency was no longer only pushing against the edges of law and custom; it was building a parallel state beside the old one and hollowing the old one out. The Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk and his allies, moved deeper into the machinery of government. Courts, Congress, and civil society tried to respond, but their efforts were scattered and often late. The week\'92s events showed a government that still held elections and passed budgets, yet was steadily rewiring who held power, whose voices counted, and which facts would be allowed to stand. The shell remained. The wiring changed.\
\
At the start of Week 5, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:50 p.m. It closed the week at 7:51 p.m., a movement of 1.3 minutes. On its face, that is a small shift. In substance, it marked the consolidation of several trends that had been building since Inauguration Day: the politicization and privatization of the civil service, the use of law as a weapon rather than a restraint, and the first organized steps toward undoing presidential term limits. The clock moved because these changes were structural, not symbolic. They altered who could say no to the president, who could be fired at will, and how long one leader might remain in office. That is what time meant this week.\
\
The most far\uc0\u8209 reaching development was the acceleration of the DOGE project and the mass firing of federal workers. Trump had already signed an order empowering Musk\'92s committee to \'93optimize\'94 the workforce. In Week 5, that authority was used at scale. Probationary employees were dismissed from the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the FAA, USAID, NIH, CDC, and other agencies. Many were early\u8209 career scientists, inspectors, and safety staff whose roles were not even fully understood by the people signing their termination letters. Courts declined to block the firings, directing unions to seek relief through labor boards instead. The effect was to turn a theoretical power into a lived reality. The professional state could be reshaped overnight by a small circle around the president.\
\
These cuts were not random. They fell heavily on the parts of government that manage risk for the public. At USDA, employees working on the H5N1 bird flu outbreak were mistakenly fired and then hurriedly rehired. At the FAA, hundreds of workers responsible for air traffic control systems were let go, raising questions about aviation safety. At NIH and CDC, funding was frozen, projects delayed, and thousands of staff\'97especially those tied to diversity or early\uc0\u8209 career programs\'97were pushed out. USAID was allowed to furlough more than 2,000 workers, weakening foreign aid at a moment of global instability. In each case, the administration cited efficiency or poor performance. In each case, the pattern pointed to something else: a deliberate thinning of expertise and a warning that loyalty mattered more than competence. Workers were left more exposed and alone.\
\
Alongside the firings came a set of executive orders that rewrote the relationship between the presidency and the rest of the state. One order told agencies to review and de\uc0\u8209 prioritize enforcement of regulations the White House deemed unconstitutional or beyond statutory authority. Another ordered the reduction or elimination of specific entities, from the Presidio Trust to the United States Institute of Peace, and the termination of advisory committees. A third brought independent regulatory agencies\'97such as the SEC and FTC\'97under direct White House and OIRA review, requiring them to submit rules and policy priorities for presidential approval. These moves did not abolish Congress or the courts. They did something subtler. They shifted day\u8209 to\u8209 day control of regulation and administration into the president\'92s hands, making it harder for independent experts to act without political clearance. Independence became a formality.\
\
The same logic appeared in the spending realm. The administration implemented a nationwide freeze on federal spending, despite laws that require the president to carry out programs Congress has funded. Agencies were told to halt or slow disbursements, including for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act projects. Disaster aid was treated as discretionary leverage: Georgia\'92s request for more time to apply for hurricane assistance was denied, even as other states watched. These acts turned the power of the purse into a bargaining chip. They signaled that appropriations would be honored or withheld not only on fiscal grounds, but also on political ones. Money followed favor.\
\
If DOGE and the executive orders were building a parallel state, the justice system was being bent to protect it. The most visible example was the Eric Adams case. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York had charged the New York City mayor with corruption. Then, under pressure from Washington, Justice Department leaders ordered the case dropped. Public Integrity Section lawyers were reportedly locked in a room and given an hour to decide who would sign the dismissal or face termination. At least five of them resigned rather than comply. The acting U.S. attorney, Danielle Sassoon, also stepped down. A federal judge in Manhattan questioned the rationale for the dismissal, noting that it rested on policy considerations rather than the merits of the case. But the motion went forward, and the message was clear. Prosecutions of powerful figures could be undone if those figures became useful allies.\
\
This was not an isolated incident. Denise Cheung, a senior DOJ official in Washington, resigned after refusing an order to open a criminal probe into a Biden\uc0\u8209 era contract and freeze assets without legal basis. The department sent a letter to Representative Robert Garcia accusing him of threatening Elon Musk, after Garcia criticized DOGE. In Washington, the new DC U.S. attorney, Ed Martin\'97a Stop the Steal activist and lawyer for January 6 defendants\'97launched \'93Operation Whirlwind,\'94 an initiative to investigate threats against officials that quickly reached into statements by Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Garcia. At the same time, Trump ordered the firing of all remaining Biden\u8209 appointed U.S. attorneys, tightening his grip on federal prosecutions nationwide. Law, in these episodes, was not a neutral framework. It was a set of tools to shield friends, intimidate critics, and clear space for the new order.\
\
The installation of Kash Patel as FBI director completed this turn. Confirmed by a 51\'9649 Senate vote, Patel came into office with a record of loyalty to Trump and open hostility to what he called the \'93deep state.\'94 Within days, he began relocating up to 1,500 agents out of FBI headquarters and signaling a shift in focus away from far\uc0\u8209 right domestic terrorism and toward left\u8209 wing protest groups. His past comments about targeting media organizations and movements like Black Lives Matter hung over these moves. The FBI, long contested but formally independent, was being reoriented toward the political priorities of the president. Combined with the mass removal of U.S. attorneys and the politicized handling of the Adams case, this marked a deeper stage of justice\u8209 system capture. Enforcement would follow power.\
\
While institutions were being reshaped, the administration also moved against the time limits that define the presidency itself. At a White House event, Trump asked the audience whether he should run for a third term and mused aloud about the constitutional limits on his tenure. The next day, at CPAC, Steve Bannon endorsed a constitutional change to allow Trump to seek another term, backed by a \'93Third Term Project\'94 think tank. These were not yet formal amendments. But they were more than jokes. They were the first organized steps to normalize the idea that the Twenty\uc0\u8209 Second Amendment might be revised or circumvented for one man. In the Democracy Clock\'92s terms, this did not end term limits. It made their erosion a live project, with elite sponsors and a public stage. The taboo was broken in plain sight.\
\
The same conference showcased another strand of the week\'92s story: the rewriting of national memory and civic education. The National Endowment for the Arts canceled grants tied to diversity, equity, and inclusion and barred recipients from running DEI or \'93gender ideology\'94 programs. The National Park Service removed references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument webpage. During Black History Month, mentions of Black Americans were reportedly scrubbed from some federal websites. At the Kennedy Center, Trump installed himself as chair and replaced the board with loyalists, appointing Ric Grenell\'97without arts administration experience\'97as president. These acts did not erase history in one stroke. They changed who would tell it, which stories would be funded, and which names would appear on official pages. Culture became another lever of rule.\
\
Nowhere was this clearer than in the schools run by the Department of Defense. A February memo ordered DoDEA schools to cancel cultural awareness events, remove materials that acknowledged the contributions of women, minorities, and LGBTQ people, and purge books and curricula labeled as \'93gender ideology\'94 or \'93discriminatory equity ideology.\'94 Librarians were told to pull titles ranging from an Indigenous history of the United States to works on transgender lives. Some schools shut their libraries entirely to comply. Students in a DOD middle school in Germany walked out in protest during a visit by Pete Hegseth, who had been reviewing materials for removal. In these classrooms, civic education was being narrowed to a version of America that left out many of its citizens. Silence was taught as normal.\
\
Information control extended beyond schools and monuments. The State Department ordered its embassies and consulates to cancel all \'93non\uc0\u8209 mission critical\'94 media subscriptions, cutting off routine access to newspapers and periodicals. The White House banned the Associated Press from press briefings, the Oval Office, and Air Force One after AP refused to adopt the term \'93Gulf of America\'94 in place of \'93Gulf of Mexico.\'94 Elon Musk publicly called for the imprisonment of \'9360 Minutes\'94 journalists. Representative Nick Begich amplified false claims that millions of people over 100 were receiving Social Security benefits, echoing Musk\'92s debunked assertions about fraud. OSHA ordered the destruction of 18 workplace safety publications because they contained words like \'93diversity\'94 or \'93gender,\'94 even when the content was not about DEI. Together, these actions thinned the flow of independent information inside government, punished media that resisted official language, and scrubbed records that did not fit the new narrative. The space for honest description shrank.\
\
At the same time, DOGE pressed for unprecedented access to the country\'92s data. Its representatives gained entry to sensitive systems at health agencies, including payment and contracting platforms. The IRS reviewed a request to grant DOGE officials broad access to tax returns and internal systems. The Social Security Administration\'92s acting head, Michelle King, resigned rather than hand over beneficiary data, including Social Security numbers and medical histories. At the General Services Administration, staff quit after a Musk ally sought access to Notify.gov, a system that can send messages to millions of Americans. The White House defended DOGE\'92s data demands as necessary to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, but fact\uc0\u8209 checkers found that its claimed savings were inflated by orders of magnitude. The pattern was stark. As ordinary citizens\'92 data became more exposed to a loosely accountable private\u8209 public network, the operations of that network remained opaque. Surveillance rose while accountability fell.\
\
Beyond the borders, U.S. foreign policy tilted further away from its postwar anchors. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told allies that the United States would not prioritize European security, would not support Ukraine\'92s NATO membership, and saw a return to Ukraine\'92s pre\uc0\u8209 2014 borders as unrealistic. Vice President J.D. Vance used the Munich Security Conference to attack European values, praise a far\u8209 right German party, and meet its leader instead of the German chancellor. Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin for more than an hour, then echoed Russian justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and blamed Ukraine for prolonging the war. The administration sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Russia without inviting Ukraine or European partners. In Riyadh, Secretary of State Marco Rubio agreed with Russia to restaff embassies, easing Moscow\'92s diplomatic isolation. Long\u8209 standing alliances were treated as optional.\
\
Economic and territorial concessions were woven into these moves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered Ukraine support in exchange for half of its mineral resources. A leaked peace plan proposed U.S. control over 50 percent of revenues from Ukraine\'92s natural resources. The White House national security adviser pressed Ukraine to stop criticizing Trump and accept a minerals deal worth an estimated $500 billion, including oil and gas. Trump suggested that Chinese troops might police a Ukraine ceasefire and floated a deal with China to halve military spending on both sides, despite the opaque nature of Chinese defense budgets. He also talked of \'93taking back\'94 the Panama Canal. European leaders responded with alarm, calling emergency summits and approving new sanctions on Russia even as Washington moved in the opposite direction. The net effect was to signal to allies and adversaries alike that U.S. commitments were now transactional, contingent, and open to bargains that favored authoritarian powers. Security became something to trade.\
\
Domestically, the same transactional logic appeared in social policy and the safety net. The administration endorsed House budget plans that extended tax cuts for the wealthy while mandating deep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and food assistance. It proposed broad reductions in social safety net programs, justified by vague claims of eliminating fraud and abuse. At the same time, it pushed tariffs that analysts warned could raise prices and trigger trade wars, contributing to a measurable drop in consumer confidence. Funding for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act implementation was frozen, and staff administering these programs were fired. In Alaska, Congressman Begich told constituents he was powerless to stop DOGE\uc0\u8209 driven cuts that cost federal jobs in his state, even as he sat on the DOGE caucus and repeated Musk\'92s false fraud claims. Policy, in these choices, was not neutral. It shifted risk and hardship downward, while preserving or expanding advantages at the top. Inequality was written into the budget.\
\
There were a few moves that, on their face, expanded rights or access. Trump signed an executive order directing his domestic policy council to propose ways to reduce the cost of in vitro fertilization and protect access to IVF. The FCC finalized rules requiring easier access to closed\uc0\u8209 caption settings for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. The National Archives scheduled a public FOIA advisory meeting. Vermont and New York advanced climate superfund laws to make fossil fuel companies pay for climate damages, even as red states and oil groups sued to block them. Courts blocked the administration\'92s attempt to end birthright citizenship and temporarily protected some DEI staff in the intelligence community. These actions mattered to the people they touched. But in the week\'92s balance of power, they were exceptions. They did not alter the main trajectory of executive consolidation, civil\u8209 service erosion, and information control. They were small countercurrents in a stronger tide.\
\
Resistance was present but fragmented. Federal workers protested outside the SpaceX building in Washington, D.C., accusing Musk of dismantling beneficial programs for profit. Democrats and grassroots groups organized demonstrations at congressional offices and Tesla dealerships against DOGE cuts. Students in military schools walked out. Unions filed lawsuits over mass firings and canceled bargaining agreements. Senators Wyden and Warren demanded answers from the IRS about DOGE\'92s access to taxpayer data. The Associated Press went to court to challenge its exclusion from the White House. European leaders convened emergency meetings and held firm on sanctions against Russia. These acts showed that the old system still had antibodies. Yet they were scattered across domains and venues, each fighting a different front of the same campaign. Coordination lagged behind acceleration.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 5, several processes were already in motion. Courts would have to decide whether the president could fire the head of the Office of Special Counsel at will, and whether DOGE\'92s access to IRS and SSA data would be constrained. Lawsuits over climate rollbacks and state climate superfund laws would test the balance between federal and state authority on environmental policy. The Senate would consider Trump\'92s nominees to key posts, including those who might replace Louis DeJoy at USPS or lead agencies now under DOGE\'92s shadow. Internationally, the minerals negotiations with Ukraine and the Saudi peace talks with Russia would continue, with or without Ukrainian participation. None of these were hypothetical. They were scheduled hearings, pending cases, and ongoing talks that would either reinforce or slow the week\'92s shifts. The near future was already on the calendar.\
\
By the end of Week 5, the Democracy Clock\'92s move to 7:51 p.m. captured a simple truth: the formal shell of American democracy still stood, but the wiring inside was being rerouted. Executive orders and DOGE\'92s reach made oversight harder and reversals more costly. Mass firings and canceled contracts weakened the civil service and labor protections, leaving workers more isolated and dependent. The justice system, from U.S. attorneys to the FBI, was being aligned with the preservation of the regime rather than the neutral enforcement of law. Schools, monuments, and websites were being edited to tell a narrower story about who counts and what the country is. Abroad, alliances built on shared democratic values were traded for deals that favored strongmen and resource claims. The frame held; the picture changed.\
\
The week matters not because any single line was crossed, but because so many lines were pushed at once. Term limits were questioned in public. Independent regulators were drawn into the president\'92s orbit. Data that underpins the social contract was sought by private hands. Protest and dissent were recast as threats. Memory itself\'97what children read, what monuments say, what official sites display\'97was curated from above. In that sense, the extra 1.3 minutes on the Democracy Clock do not measure time alone. They mark the deepening difficulty of restoring a system in which power is limited, law is a check rather than a weapon, and the story a nation tells about itself belongs to its people, not to its rulers. At the close of Week 5, with the clock at 7:51 p.m., that restoration had become harder, not easier.\
