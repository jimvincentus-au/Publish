Week 28 of Trump’s second term left the Democracy Clock frozen at 8:06 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked a dense consolidation of power. The administration fused emergency authorities, immigration law, and FEMA money into a domestic archipelago of camps, from Alligator Alcatraz’s legal black hole to abusive private facilities and a new grant pipeline for detention infrastructure. An executive order targeting homeless people, Alien Enemies Act deportations without hearings, and pressure on DACA recipients to “self-deport” extended confinement logic beyond the border. Vice President Vance’s ancestry-based citizenship rhetoric, SNAP and Medicaid cuts, and targeted attacks on trans healthcare and reproductive rights hardened a hierarchy of belonging. AI-driven deregulation, loyalist judicial and prosecutorial appointments, and politicized data at BLS and FBI hollowed out institutional checks. Universities and media were disciplined through funding threats, merger conditions, and licensing intimidation, while archives and statistics were curated to protect the president. Courts, states, and investigative journalists mounted scattered resistance, but the moral floor continued to sag.
