This move enables troops to detain immigrants accused of trespassing until they can be handed over to immigration agents.

The lawsuit challenges the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) decision to remove a public tracker that monitored government spending of funds appropriated by Congress. The suit argues that the removal violates federal law, which mandates transparency in apportionment documents to prevent abuses of power. The Government Accountability Office also criticized the OMB's rationale, emphasizing the importance of such transparency for federal audits and congressional oversight.",

Griffin, who lost the election, claimed these voters were \"never residents\" of North Carolina. However, evidence suggests many of these voters, including Josiah Young and Derrick Raphael, have verifiable ties to the state. The court's decision also affects overseas military ballots lacking photo ID, potentially altering the election outcome. The ruling is being contested in federal court, delaying election certification.",
