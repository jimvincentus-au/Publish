This chapter steps back from weekly events to define the Six Democratic Imperatives that translate the Constitution’s promises into modern operational duties. It argues that a republic cannot survive on eighteenth‑century design alone; it must continually renew accountability, adaptability, inclusion, dignity, peace, and knowledge as living functions. Each imperative is traced from its founding roots to its present demands: independent oversight and transparency for accountability, anticipatory governance for adaptability, broad and meaningful participation for inclusion, structural protections for dignity, restrained yet effective public order for peace, and resilient information systems for knowledge. The chapter emphasizes that these are not optional virtues but interlocking requirements. When one weakens, others strain; when enough fail, the system still looks constitutional while no longer performing its democratic work. The Six Imperatives become the benchmark by which the Democracy Clock will judge whether power remains accountable and the civic covenant intact.
