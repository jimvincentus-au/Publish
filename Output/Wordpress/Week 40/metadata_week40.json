The sky is heavy and overcast, with news camera tripods and cordoned-off areas suggesting secrecy and controlled access."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 40 of Trump\u2019s second term traced how personal rule can harden without a coup. The Democracy Clock inched from 8:08 to 8:11 p.m., reflecting cumulative erosion rather than a single shock. The president ordered the White House East Wing demolished for a donor-funded ballroom bearing his name, shrouding the work in secrecy while regulators quietly erased prior warnings about AI harms. Clemency and cash flowed to insiders: George Santos\u2019s sentence was commuted, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was pardoned, and Justice Department funds reportedly paid Trump hundreds of millions over past investigations, even as prosecutors pursued cases against Letitia James, James Comey, and John Brennan. North Carolina\u2019s gerrymander and Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s refusal to seat Adelita Grijalva blunted representation during a grinding shutdown. Militarized immigration raids, Guard deployments, and talk of invoking the Insurrection Act turned security inward against protesters and migrants. AI propaganda, a curated Pentagon press corps, and cronyist tariffs and bailouts rounded out a week in which resistance grew but constraints on presidential power visibly thinned.",
