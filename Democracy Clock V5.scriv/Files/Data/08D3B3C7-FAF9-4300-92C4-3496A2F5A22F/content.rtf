In Week 12, the pattern that had been emerging since the start of the term came into sharper focus. Power moved inward, toward the presidency, and downward, onto those with the least protection. Law, economy, and memory were each pulled closer to the center of executive will. At the same time, the institutions meant to check that will\'97courts, Congress, universities, the press\'97were tested, bent, and in some cases forced into open resistance. The week did not bring a single spectacular break. It brought a dense run of decisions that made the new order feel more settled, more normal, and harder to reverse.\
\
On the Democracy Clock, the public time at the end of the prior period was 7:49 p.m. It remains 7:49 p.m. now, though the underlying measure crept forward by a fraction of a minute. The face of the clock did not change, but the mechanism inside did. Thirty\uc0\u8209 plus traits that track how power is used and constrained moved further toward midnight. Executive power without effective oversight, law as a weapon rather than a limit, politicized civil service, crony capitalism, voter suppression framed as integrity, and stratified citizenship all grew more present. The hands did not jump because some counter\u8209 forces also showed themselves: courts ordering a deported man returned, judges restoring press access, states and attorneys general suing to defend schools and lunches, millions of people in the streets. The week\'92s story is not of a sudden plunge. It is of walls closing in while a few beams still hold.\
\
The first and most visible field of struggle was economic power. Over the course of days, the president announced, escalated, paused, and reconfigured sweeping tariffs on nearly every major trading partner. China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Israel, and dozens of other countries saw their goods hit with new duties, some as high as 145% on Chinese imports once \'93reciprocal\'94 and fentanyl\uc0\u8209 linked surcharges were stacked. Markets lurched in response. Trillions in paper wealth vanished, then partly returned on rumors of a pause, only to fall again when those rumors proved false. Analysts at the Federal Reserve and major banks warned that recession odds had risen sharply. Yet the decisions were made by executive order, justified under emergency statutes, and insulated from immediate legislative correction by House rule changes that blocked votes on disapproval. Trade policy, once a shared power, had become a lever in one person\'92s hand. That lever now moves whole markets.\
\
Those moves did not occur in a vacuum. They were tied to a broader reshaping of the state\'92s economic skeleton. The Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk as a \'93special government employee,\'94 continued to cut deep into the civilian side of government. Thousands of positions at the Social Security Administration were eliminated, leaving staff to describe a \'93death spiral\'94 of service. Grants for cancer research and programs for high\uc0\u8209 school students with disabilities were terminated. Funding for AIDS, Covid, and climate research was slashed. At the same time, the president and his defense secretary proposed a $1 trillion Pentagon budget and signed orders to modernize defense acquisitions and foreign arms sales. The pattern was clear. Civilian expertise and social insurance were treated as costs to be pared back. Military and security capacity were treated as engines to be fed. The balance of stewardship shifted with each cut.\
\
Energy and climate policy followed the same line. In a single day, the president signed orders to \'93reinvigorate\'94 coal, to classify it as a favored \'93mineral,\'94 to use the Defense Production Act to boost mining, and to direct the Justice Department to attack state climate laws that sought to make fossil fuel companies pay for damage from extreme weather. Another order told agencies to apply \'93zero\uc0\u8209 based regulatory budgeting\'94 to energy rules, forcing them to sunset and justify protections that had taken decades to build. A separate order on the electric grid framed the country as in a \'93national energy emergency\'94 and streamlined the use of extraordinary powers to keep all generation, including coal, online. These moves did not just change policy. They shifted who decides what counts as an emergency, and whose science and experience matter when the grid, the climate, and public health are at stake. The emergency frame itself became a tool.\
\
The same week, the administration moved to hollow out the very institutions that track and explain climate risk. After the Supreme Court cleared the way by blocking a lower\uc0\u8209 court order on standing, NOAA sent termination letters to hundreds of employees, many of them climate scientists and forecasters who had been in limbo since an earlier mass firing. The loss of that staff will not be felt in a single headline. It will be felt in less precise hurricane tracks, weaker seasonal forecasts, and a thinner base of data for global climate assessments. Cuts at the Food and Drug Administration, already raising alarms about food safety, fit the same pattern: neutral expertise treated as expendable, even as the risks it manages grow. The civil service was being thinned where it watches most closely.\
\
If economic and environmental power were being centralized, legal power was being sharpened and pointed. The administration\'92s use of immigration law showed this most starkly. Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status were detained despite a court order blocking revocation of their status. A Chinese woman died by suicide in a border patrol station where welfare checks were falsified. A Nicaraguan asylum seeker who had complied with every ICE check\uc0\u8209 in was arrested and held. The mandate for ICE was broadened from focusing on those with criminal records to \'93all immigrants without legal status,\'94 including those with pending cases and those who had been living under supervision for years. The Department of Homeland Security announced plans to spend up to $45 billion on new, privately run detention facilities with lower standards and less oversight. Deportation flights were contracted out to a low\u8209 cost airline. The state\'92s coercive power over non\u8209 citizens was being expanded and outsourced at once. Status and origin now shaped basic safety.\
\
At the same time, the administration reached back to an eighteenth\uc0\u8209 century statute, the Alien Enemies Act, to justify deportations of Venezuelan migrants labeled as gang members. The Supreme Court, in a series of 5\'964 emergency orders, allowed those deportations to proceed, insisting only that detainees be told of the law being used and given \'93reasonable time\'94 to file habeas petitions in Texas. The Court did not decide whether using a wartime law in this way was lawful in principle. It decided that challenges must be brought in venues favorable to the government and that class\u8209 wide relief was improper. In another case, the Court stayed a lower\u8209 court order requiring the rehiring of 16,000 probationary federal workers, allowing mass firings at NOAA and other agencies to stand while litigation continued. These rulings did not openly endorse every executive act. They shifted the terrain. They made it harder for groups to challenge systemic abuses and easier for the administration to act first and defend later.\
\
Yet the judiciary was not of one mind. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father with legal status who had been deported to a Salvadoran prison after an admitted \'93administrative error,\'94 a district judge called the government\'92s conduct \'93wholly lawless\'94 and ordered his return. When the administration resisted, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous 9\'960 decision, required the government to \'93facilitate\'94 his release and treat his case as if he had never been removed. Even then, the administration claimed it could not act quickly, and lower courts demanded daily updates. In another line of cases, judges blocked the freezing of school lunch funds in Maine, halted the termination of a humanitarian parole program for hundreds of thousands of migrants, and ordered the White House to restore full Associated Press access after it tried to bar the wire service for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the \'93Gulf of America.\'94 These rulings did not reverse the week\'92s structural shifts. They showed that some judges were still willing to assert that law binds the executive, not just arms it. The bench itself became a contested field.\
\
The Department of Justice was being pulled in the opposite direction. A career immigration lawyer who told a court that Abrego Garcia\'92s deportation had been a mistake was placed on indefinite leave. The attorney general declared that DOJ lawyers must \'93zealously advocate\'94 for the government or face consequences. Another lawyer, who had supervised the case, was also sidelined. At the same time, DOJ disbanded its national cryptocurrency enforcement team, signaling that it would no longer pursue regulatory actions against exchanges and platforms, even as fraud and abuse in that sector remained widespread. In a separate filing, DOJ argued that January 6 defendants who had been pardoned by the president should be reimbursed for restitution they had paid for damage to the Capitol. The message was plain. Lawyers who admitted error or pursued certain kinds of crime would be punished. Those who defended the president\'92s allies would be rewarded. Law was being sorted by loyalty.\
\
The administration\'92s use of law against critics extended beyond immigration and criminal cases. On one day, the president signed memoranda directing DOJ to investigate two former officials, Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs, for alleged leaks and \'93weaponization\'94 of their offices. On another, he signed an executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm that had helped Dominion Voting Systems secure a major settlement from Fox News. The order stripped the firm\'92s lawyers of security clearances and barred them from federal buildings, making it nearly impossible for them to represent clients with business before the government. Earlier orders had threatened similar sanctions against other firms that represented political rivals. Some firms fought back in court and won injunctions. Others, facing the loss of access and contracts, agreed to provide $600 million in pro bono work for causes favored by the president, to drop race\uc0\u8209 conscious hiring, and to recast their public commitments. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which had been probing those firms\'92 diversity practices, agreed to withdraw its inquiry as part of the deal. The line between independent bar and state instrument grew thinner. It bent under pressure from above.\
\
Universities, long treated as semi\uc0\u8209 autonomous spaces of inquiry, were drawn into the same orbit. Columbia University saw $400 million in federal grants suspended over its handling of pro\u8209 Palestinian protests. The administration demanded bans on face masks, new arrest powers for campus security, and direct control over the Middle East studies department. When Columbia agreed to some changes, officials floated the idea of placing the university under a consent decree, which would give a federal judge ongoing oversight of its policies under the administration\'92s terms. Cornell and Northwestern had more than $1.7 billion in funding frozen over similar allegations. The University of Pennsylvania faced a pause in grants over its inclusion of transgender athletes. Sixteen state attorneys general and a governor sued over cuts to federal education funds for low\u8209 income students. A House committee that had opened an investigation into Northwestern\'92s law clinics withdrew its inquiry after professors sued, claiming violations of academic freedom. The message to campuses was mixed. Federal money could be used to punish dissent and shape speech. Courts could still, sometimes, push back. The price of independence rose.\
\
The same struggle played out in the realm of information and memory. In late March, the president signed an order directing the Smithsonian Institution to remove \'93improper, divisive, or anti\uc0\u8209 American ideology\'94 from its museums and research centers. Soon after, the National Park Service quietly removed a photograph and quote from Harriet Tubman from its Underground Railroad webpage, replacing them with language about \'93Black/White cooperation\'94 and omitting any mention of slavery. The Pentagon ordered a \'93digital content refresh\'94 to scrub terms like \'93racism,\'94 \'93ethnicity,\'94 and \'93LGBTQ\'94 from its public sites. In Mississippi, the state library commission deleted race\u8209 relations and gender\u8209 studies databases from a statewide system used by schools and universities. After journalists exposed the Tubman changes, the Park Service restored the photo and quote, but the broader pattern remained. Official narratives were being edited to soften or erase histories of oppression and resistance. What the public could see of its own past narrowed.\
\
Surveillance and data\uc0\u8209 sharing deepened that pattern in a different way. The Internal Revenue Service signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security to share taxpayer data on undocumented immigrants with final removal orders or under investigation. Acting IRS leaders resigned in protest. Staff from the Department of Government Efficiency, working with Palantir and IRS engineers, held a \'93hackathon\'94 to build tools that would mine those records for deportation targets. DHS announced that it would begin monitoring the social media of visa holders and green\u8209 card applicants for \'93antisemitism.\'94 ICE\'92s acting director boasted of working with Musk\'92s department to access Social Security numbers for voter\u8209 fraud investigations. At the same time, the government mistakenly sent deportation notices to U.S. citizens, green\u8209 card holders, and even an immigration lawyer whose email address had been used on clients\'92 forms. The net of surveillance widened. The accuracy and restraint with which it was used narrowed. Ordinary people were watched more; elite misconduct stayed in shadow.\
\
Voting rights and representation were not spared. In Washington, the House passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, requiring documentary proof of citizenship\'97such as a passport or birth certificate\'97to register or update registration for federal elections. The bill also ordered states to purge voter rolls based on incomplete data and allowed citizens to sue election officials who failed to comply. Critics warned that millions of eligible voters, especially young people, rural residents, and people of color, lacked ready access to such documents. In North Carolina, a Court of Appeals ordered a recount and verification of 60,000 ballots in a state supreme court race, requiring affected voters to provide proof of identity within 15 business days or see their votes discarded. Many of those ballots came from people without driver\'92s licenses or Social Security numbers, and from military and overseas voters who had been told by the state that no ID was required. The state supreme court stayed the ruling temporarily, but later ordered thousands of overseas voters to prove eligibility within 30 days or lose their votes. Together, these moves did not end elections. They changed who could take part, and on what terms. The franchise itself became more conditional.\
\
Against this tightening, civil society still moved. On April 5, millions of people joined \'93Hands Off\'94 protests in more than a thousand cities, denouncing what they saw as the dismantling of government and the concentration of power in the hands of the president and his business allies. A separate network, the 50501 Movement, organized coordinated demonstrations in all fifty state capitals and Washington, D.C., offering \'93Know Your Rights\'94 and digital safety guides to participants. Days later, Medicaid recipients from twenty\uc0\u8209 eight states marched on Capitol Hill to oppose proposed cuts that would strip health care and food assistance from low\u8209 income families, children, and the elderly. These actions did not stop the budget framework or the SAVE Act. They showed that large numbers of people were willing to claim the streets and the hearing rooms as their own. Public space remained contested, not surrendered.\
\
The week also saw a quieter kind of resistance from within institutions. The Social Security Administration, after public outcry and investigative reporting, abandoned a plan to end phone service for new claims, which would have forced up to 85,000 elderly and disabled people each week to visit field offices in person. The Election Assistance Commission renewed the charters of its advisory boards and technical committees, preserving expert input into voting systems. The National Archives sought public comment on its information collections for civilian records and veteran recruitment. These acts were small, procedural, and easily overlooked. They mattered because they kept alive habits of consultation, transparency, and service that authoritarian systems tend to erode. Routine process became a form of quiet defense.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 12, several processes were already in motion. The 90\uc0\u8209 day pause on some tariffs, announced under market pressure, is set to expire in July, with the president openly threatening to restore or raise duties on dozens of countries if they do not meet his demands. Bills in Congress to reclaim tariff authority and to bar contracts for companies owned by \'93special government employees\'94 like Elon Musk have been introduced but face veto threats and procedural roadblocks. Lawsuits challenging the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for tariffs, the sanctions on the International Criminal Court prosecutor, the education funding cuts, and the executive orders against law firms are moving through the courts. Immigration cases involving Mahmoud Khalil, R\'fcmeysa \'d6zt\'fcrk, and the mass use of the Alien Enemies Act will test how far judges are willing to go in constraining deportation powers. The administration\'92s plan to seek a consent decree over Columbia University, if pursued, will force a federal judge to decide how much control the executive can exert over campus governance in the name of combating antisemitism. Each of these fights will clarify where lines still hold.\
\
In the larger arc of the term, Week 12 matters because it shows how quickly the extraordinary can become routine. Emergency trade powers, once reserved for rare crises, are now tools of day\uc0\u8209 to\u8209 day bargaining. Deportation statutes from 1798 are being used to move people across borders in 2025. Executive orders reach into showerheads, coal leases, law firm hiring, and the content of museum exhibits. Universities, law firms, and corporations that once saw themselves as independent centers of judgment are being drawn into a system where access, contracts, and even survival depend on alignment with the president\'92s agenda. Surveillance expands, while the crimes and conflicts of those closest to power remain largely untouched. The structure of public life tilts toward rule by decree.\
\
Yet the week also shows that the story is not finished. Courts can still order a wrongly deported man returned and force the White House to reopen its doors to a disfavored news outlet. Senators from both parties can still introduce bills to claw back powers they once ceded. State attorneys general can still sue to defend school lunches and education funds. Millions of people can still fill streets and hearing rooms to say that what is being done in their name does not speak for them. These acts do not move the clock backward on their own. They keep it from racing forward unchecked. They mark that not everyone has accepted the new normal.\
\
At the close of Week 12, the Democracy Clock remains at 7:49 p.m. The small internal advance reflects a week in which executive overreach, weaponized law, politicized civil service, crony capitalism, voter exclusion, and stratified citizenship all deepened, while pockets of institutional resistance held. The moral floor of the republic\'97character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, stewardship\'97showed cracks across every beam. The hour is still early enough that choices matter. But the pattern of those choices is now clear. Power is being gathered, tested, and used in ways that assume it will not be given up easily. Whether the remaining checks can hold, and whether the public will insist that they do, is the question that lies beyond this week\'92s record.\
