This includes the removal of attorneys involved in prosecuting the January 6 Capitol attack. On his first day in office, Trump granted pardons to over 1,500 allies involved in the attack. The DOJ's focus has shifted towards pursuing MAGA agendas, such as aggressive immigration crackdowns, while civil rights and national security investigations suffer from resource depletion. The civil rights division has lost 70% of its staff, and the voting section's mission has aligned with Trump's election agenda.",

The investigation could lead to recalling Kelly to active duty for a court-martial.

      "summary": "President Trump sent envoys to Moscow with a proposal to recognize Russian control over Eastern Ukrainian territory. This move, involving Trump confidant Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, signals a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy that could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and contradicts the stance of European allies. The proposal raises questions about Trump's loyalties and the implications for international relations and global democracy.",
