Week 9 of Trump’s second term traced how emergency logic and personal grievance seeped into ordinary governance. The Democracy Clock moved from 7:52 p.m. to 7:56 p.m., a 3.3‑minute erosion, as the administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants, continued flights in defiance of Judge James Boasberg’s orders, and turned images of shackled deportees and El Salvador’s prisons into propaganda. Courts pushed back, blocking some deportations, halting the dismantling of USAID, and limiting DOGE’s access to Social Security data, even as Trump demanded Boasberg’s impeachment and allies filed articles against him. Simultaneously, executive orders moved to dismantle the Department of Education, shift student loans to the SBA, and freeze hundreds of millions in university funding tied to protests and trans inclusion. DOGE consolidated data and procurement power while agencies like the IRS, FTC, NNSA, and USDA were hollowed out. Independent media and public history were pared back, with USAGM/VOA shuttered and disability and gun‑violence guidance removed, as Elon Musk’s firms gained privileged access to contracts and infrastructure.
