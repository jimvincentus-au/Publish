Week 3 of Trump’s second term advanced authoritarian consolidation without a single spectacular rupture. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:45 to 7:46 p.m., reflecting a modest numerical shift that masked deep structural change. Sweeping executive orders froze foreign aid, tested impoundment of domestic funds, and weaponized emergency tariffs, while threats to “take over” Gaza, retake the Panama Canal, and strike Mexican cartels signaled a foreign policy unmoored from multilateral norms. At home, the Justice Department and FBI were purged of investigators tied to Trump and January 6, mass pardons erased accountability for the Capitol attack, and inspectors general across major agencies were fired. Musk’s DOGE network gained access to Treasury payment systems, HR and small-business databases, and key IT infrastructure, embedding private actors inside the state’s core plumbing. DEI protections, trans rights, asylum law, and birthright citizenship came under direct assault. Courts, unions, states, and activists won injunctions and partial rollbacks, but their victories were reactive and fragmented against a coordinated presidency–oligarch nexus.
