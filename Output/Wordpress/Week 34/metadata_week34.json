  "long_synopsis": "Week 34 of Trump\u2019s second term tightened patterns rather than unveiling a single shock. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:07 p.m., moving only a tenth of a minute, yet the machinery behind the face grew more ominous. National Guard troops and federal agents took over policing in Washington DC and moved into Chicago, with deployments planned for Memphis, turning military force into a standing tool of domestic governance. ICE mega-raids, lethal traffic stops, and service exclusions treated immigrants and sanctuary cities as internal enemies. After Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, the presidency and allies converted grief into a campaign against dissent, rewarding loyalty with medals and proposed statues while punishing critics through firings, arrests, and threats of lifetime bans. Courts and Congress offered partial resistance but more often enabled executive priorities: easing purges of civil servants, greenlighting racial profiling, and allowing deep cuts to science, health, and climate programs. Information about elite wrongdoing and state action was delayed, curated, or spun, while religion and symbolism were harnessed to sanctify an increasingly unequal, militarized order.",
