Week 22 of Trump’s second term did not feature a single shattering decree so much as a dense accumulation of moves that sharpened hierarchy. Immigration policy became the clearest instrument: arrest quotas, raids in Democratic cities, canceled asylum appointments, and new oversight barriers turned enforcement into partisan punishment, even as wealthy applicants and favored industries received exemptions and a $5 million “Trump Card” to residency. Executive power pressed outward elsewhere, from defying a TikTok divestiture law and asserting veto control over U.S. Steel to keeping coal plants open under a standing “energy emergency.” Security forces and emergency language were used to police “No Kings” protests, while rhetoric from officials and a political assassination in Minnesota raised the stakes of dissent. Simultaneously, the administration hollowed out public health and media institutions, dismantling Voice of America, gutting CDC capacity, and editing civic symbols from the MLK bust to the Harvey Milk ship. Courts and parts of Congress clawed back ground in scattered rulings and bills, but the overall pattern was of a state more willing to sort, punish, and reward on its own terms. The Democracy Clock inched forward by 0.3 minutes, its face unchanged at 8:00 p.m., even as the machinery inside grew more brittle.
