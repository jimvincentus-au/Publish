\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 37 captures a government that no longer merely centralizes power but deliberately aims it. A manufactured shutdown becomes siege governance: mass resignations and threatened firings hollow out the civil service, while OMB selectively freezes infrastructure, climate, and homelessness funds in Democratic-led jurisdictions. Law is repurposed as a weapon\'97retaliatory prosecutions, immigration raids, and novel civil-rights lawsuits against disfavored protesters\'97backed by courts that increasingly tolerate racial profiling and harsh deportation policies even as a few judges block FEMA diversions and speech-based deportations. At Quantico, Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth recast the military\'92s mission toward domestic unrest and loyalty enforcement, pairing rhetoric with troop deployments and an \'93armed conflict\'94 against cartels. Immigration enforcement becomes a theater of fear and stratified citizenship. Simultaneously, deepfakes, pseudoscience, and partisan agency messaging flood the information space while Voice of America goes dark. The Democracy Clock edges from 7:58 to 7:59 p.m., reflecting broad, coordinated erosion rather than a single break.\
