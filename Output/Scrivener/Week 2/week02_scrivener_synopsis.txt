In the second week of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock moved from 7:39 p.m. to 7:45 p.m., a 5.4‑minute lurch toward democratic erosion. The week read less like improvisation than execution of a plan. Mass pardons for January 6 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, combined with firings of DOJ prosecutors and FBI officials, closure of co‑defendant cases, and removal of the January 6 prosecutions database to turn law into a shield for regime allies and a warning to investigators. Inside the state, inspectors general, labor‑rights enforcers, and civil servants were purged or stripped of protections, while Musk‑linked aides centralized personnel data. Immigration and citizenship policy shifted toward a tiered order enforced through raids in schools and churches, Guantánamo expansion, TPS rollbacks, and an attempted end to birthright citizenship. Parallel DEI and LGBTQ+ rollbacks, curriculum directives, and archival deletions curated information and memory. Courts, states, and civil society fought back with injunctions and lawsuits, but mostly in reactive, fragmented fashion.
