Week 35 of Trump’s second term traced how security, law, and memory were molded to presidential will. The Democracy Clock inched from 8:07 to 8:08 p.m., a small numerical shift masking a dense pattern of erosion. National Guard deployments in Memphis and a federal takeover of Washington DC’s police normalized militarized, centralized control over local policing. ICE raids, abusive detention, and speech-based visa revocations deepened a tiered system of citizenship, even as courts sporadically protected vulnerable immigrants. Charlie Kirk’s killing became a pretext for elite security funding, loyalty tests, and media purges, while FCC pressure and corporate compliance sidelined critical voices and elevated regime-aligned programming. Inside government, vaccine advisory bodies were purged, climate science undermined, labor protections gutted, and watchdogs intimidated or reassigned. Courts, states, and civil society mounted real but fragmented resistance. The week’s net effect was to make opposition costlier and executive power more insulated, with law and information increasingly bent toward preserving the regime.
