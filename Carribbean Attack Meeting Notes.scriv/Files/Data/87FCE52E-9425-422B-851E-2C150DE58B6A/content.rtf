\f0\b\fs30 \cf2 1-Minute Summary (Factual, Concise)
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
In 
\f2\b 2025
\f1\b0 , the United States military has carried out **multiple lethal strikes on vessels in the 
\f2\b Caribbean Sea
\f1\b0  and the 
\f2\b eastern Pacific
\f1\b0 , targeting boats the U.S. government says were operated by alleged drug traffickers or \'93narco-terrorist\'94 groups. These operations are part of a broader U.S. campaign against maritime drug trafficking under 
\f3\i Operation Southern Spear
\f1\i0 .  \
\
Since 
\f2\b September
\f1\b0 , 
\f2\b more than 80 people
\f1\b0  have died in at least 
\f2\b 22 strikes
\f1\b0  on more than 20 vessels, including operations off the Venezuelan coast. The U.S. has not publicly released evidence linking all boats to drug or terror activity, and families of some killed have filed complaints alleging wrongful deaths.  \
\
A 
\f2\b specific incident on September 2
\f1\b0  has drawn intense scrutiny: several media outlets reported that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized an order to use lethal force that resulted in 
\f2\b all occupants of a boat being killed
\f1\b0 , including a controversial follow-up strike on survivors, raising serious legal and ethical questions. These reports have triggered 
\f2\b congressional investigations, legal debate over the strikes\'92 legality under U.S. and international law
\f1\b0 , and claims these actions may constitute 
\f3\i extrajudicial killings or war crimes
\f1\i0 .  \
\
The U.S. government defends the strikes as lawful actions against threats to national and regional security, characterizing the operations as necessary to disrupt drug trafficking.  }
