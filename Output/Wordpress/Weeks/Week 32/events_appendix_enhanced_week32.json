The project, which was 80% complete, was expected to power 350,000 homes. The halt was justified by the need to review national security concerns, following an order by President Trump to reconsider existing wind energy leases. The decision has been met with opposition from state officials and environmental advocates who view it as a setback to renewable energy goals.",

Ábrego's legal team has filed a lawsuit challenging his detention and potential deportation to Uganda, arguing it is retaliatory. The judge extended a temporary order barring deportation and mandated that Ábrego remain in custody within a 200-mile radius of the Maryland court.",
