\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 20 Appendix: Inequality as Operating System\
\
This was a structurally heavy week of authoritarian consolidation across multiple fronts. The Trump administration advanced a sweeping agenda of executive overreach (impoundment threats, mass federal layoffs, travel bans, Harvard visa suspension), while the House pushed through the \'93Big, Beautiful Bill\'94 and related reconciliation measures that slash social supports, preempt state AI regulation, and carve out industry favors. Immigration enforcement escalated into mass warrantless arrests, collateral detentions, and high-profile raids, paired with military deployment against largely peaceful protests\'97deepening the fusion of security forces with regime priorities. Information control and memory politics intensified: censorship of VA scientists, Pentagon press lockouts, removal of Jackie Robinson and Harvey Milk honors, and open presidential promotion of conspiracy theories. Courts delivered a mixed picture: some rulings defended due process and speech, but the Supreme Court repeatedly used emergency orders to greenlight data grabs, DOGE operations, and executive removals. Social stratification hardened via expansive travel bans, attacks on LGBTQ and reproductive rights, and budget choices that systematically target the poor, children, veterans, and immigrants. Overall, the week exerts strong positive pressure toward centralized, personalized, and punitive rule.\

Week 20 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump announced and signed orders doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports (2025-06-02): Trump\'92s decision to sharply raise steel and aluminum tariffs used unilateral trade powers with major downstream economic effects, testing how far executive authority can reshape markets without new legislative approval.\
\
2. President Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought signaled plans to bypass Congress using impoundment and other tools to cut federal spending and jobs (2025-06-01): By floating use of impoundment and executive tools to impose deep federal workforce and spending cuts, the administration tested limits on the president\'92s ability to override Congress\'92s constitutional power of the purse.\
\
3. President Trump ordered investigations into Joe Biden\'92s pardons and overall presidency citing alleged cognitive decline (2025-06-05): Launching executive and Justice Department inquiries into a predecessor\'92s competence and clemency decisions risked turning prosecutorial power into a tool for delegitimizing prior administrations and their lawful acts.\
\
4. President Trump rescinded Biden-era emergency abortion guidance under EMTALA (2025-06-05): Ending enforcement of guidance that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions narrowed federal protection for life\uc0\u8209 saving care, shifting life\u8209 or\u8209 death decisions toward state bans and away from national standards.\
\
5. President Trump issued sweeping travel bans on nationals from multiple countries and restricted foreign students at Harvard (2025-06-05): New proclamations barring entry from 12 countries and suspending Harvard\'92s foreign student visas concentrated immigration and education control in the presidency, with discriminatory impacts on targeted nationalities and institutions.\
\
6. President Trump ordered an investigation into Biden-era spending and requested rescission of $9.4 billion in approved funds (2025-06-05): The rescission package targeting public media and foreign aid used executive initiative to claw back congressionally approved funds, pressuring lawmakers and signaling willingness to weaponize budget tools against disfavored programs.\
\
7.

\
8.

\
9. President Trump used pardons and Justice Department directives to nullify January 6 prosecutions and removed related prosecutors (2025-06-03): Mass pardons for January 6 defendants and firing prosecutors who handled those cases signaled tolerance for political violence and weakened the Justice Department\'92s independence in enforcing accountability for attacks on Congress.\
\
10. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USNS Harvey Milk renamed and planned a personal military parade (2025-06-03): Renaming a ship honoring a gay rights icon and staging a birthday military parade used symbolic military decisions to advance culture\uc0\u8209 war goals and personalize state power displays.\
\
11. President Trump threatened to terminate Elon Musk\'92s government contracts and subsidies after political disagreements (2025-06-06): Threats to cancel major federal contracts with Musk\'92s companies over policy disputes showed how procurement and subsidies could be wielded as personal leverage rather than neutral tools of public administration.\
\
12. President Trump directed agencies to prepare cancellation of significant federal funding for California (2025-06-05): Ordering agencies to identify grants to pull from California used federal spending as a weapon against a disfavored state, pressuring local policy choices through economic coercion.\
\
13.

\
3. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia allowed states\'92 lawsuit against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to proceed (2025-05-31): By holding that DOGE\'92s actions lacked statutory authorization, the court opened the door to testing whether a quasi\uc0\u8209 private figure can lawfully wield broad federal administrative power.\

\
5. U.S. Supreme Court ordered the return of a wrongly deported resident and upheld limits on firing an NLRB chair (2025-06-01): The Court both intervened to remedy an unlawful deportation and endorsed Congress\'92s ability to constrain presidential removal of independent\uc0\u8209 agency heads, underscoring complex, sometimes conflicting, boundaries on executive power.\

\
9. U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Mexico\'92s lawsuit against U.S. gunmakers and expanded religious exemptions in two cases (2025-06-05): Rulings shielding gun manufacturers from foreign suits and broadening religious exemptions in unemployment taxes and discrimination claims reinforced statutory protections for powerful actors and reinterpreted neutrality among religions.\
\

\
12. Louisiana legislature passed an anti-grooming law criminalizing manipulative pursuit of minors for sexual offenses (2025-06-05): Louisiana\'92s unanimous anti\uc0\u8209 grooming statute expanded tools to intervene before child sexual abuse occurs, strengthening legal protections for minors while raising questions about enforcement scope.\
\

Congressional Budget Office released analyses showing Trump tariffs and omnibus bill would raise inflation, deficits, and uninsured rates (2025-06-05): CBO scoring that tariffs and the omnibus bill would slow growth, add trillions to the deficit, and strip health coverage from millions provided an independent check on administration fiscal claims.\

\
18. House Oversight Committee leadership sought testimony from Biden aides about his cognitive state and decision-making (2025-06-05): The committee\'92s push for transcribed interviews on Biden\'92s mental fitness blurred lines between legitimate oversight and partisan efforts to retroactively undermine a prior administration\'92s authority.\
\
19. Federal courts and bar authorities sanctioned misuse of AI in legal filings and protected yoga instruction as First Amendment speech (2025-05-31): A Utah court\'92s sanction for fabricated AI citations and the Ninth Circuit\'92s ruling that teaching yoga is protected speech reinforced professional and expressive standards in the justice system.\

Economic Structure\
\
1. Trump administration proposed deep cuts to Medicaid, ACA coverage, NIH, VA medical services, and other health programs (2025-06-06): Budget proposals slashing Medicaid, ACA subsidies, NIH research, and VA medical services would shift health costs onto individuals and private markets, weakening public health infrastructure and widening inequality.\

\
11. Trump administration and DHS published and then removed flawed sanctuary jurisdiction lists amid criticism (2025-06-02): Issuing error\uc0\u8209 filled lists of sanctuary jurisdictions and later retracting them showed how official communications can be used to stigmatize localities even when factually unreliable.\

11. Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget signaled intent to use impoundment and executive tools to cut federal workforce without full congressional approval (2025-06-01): Planning to bypass Congress on major spending and workforce cuts challenged the legislature\'92s power of the purse and advanced a model of unilateral executive control over the civil service.\
\

\
13.
