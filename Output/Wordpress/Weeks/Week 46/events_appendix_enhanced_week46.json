These raids are part of a broader mass deportation agenda under the Trump administration. The Clean Carwash Worker Center, an advocacy group, has been instrumental in providing legal aid and support to affected workers, helping 20 individuals secure release on bond. The raids have caused significant disruption to the car wash industry and have instilled fear and insecurity among workers and their communities.",

The strikes were purportedly aimed at \"terrorists\" involved in drug trafficking. However, the military has not identified all the individuals killed, and there is no public evidence supporting the claims. Colombia's government reported that at least one strike killed an innocent fisherman. The legal authority for these actions is questioned, as the Department of Justice argues that drug trafficking finances a \"non-international armed conflict\" against the U.S.",
