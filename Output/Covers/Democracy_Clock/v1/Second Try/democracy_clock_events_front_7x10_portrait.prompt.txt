Democracy Clock Events — book cover background artwork (front cover only).
    ORIENTATION: portrait, designed for a 7x10 book cover.

    PALETTE + TONE (CANONICAL)
- archival artifact aesthetic; institutional, documentary, historically grounded
- richer, disciplined tones (not pale tan): deep slate blue, smoky steel, warm parchment, restrained amber highlights
- low saturation overall but with deeper midtones; moderate contrast; avoid both crushed blacks and washed-out beige
- soft diffuse light with gentle directional falloff; no theatrical spotlighting; no neon
- subtle archival grain / paper texture / film noise (NOT painterly brushwork; NOT flat vector illustration)
- mood: serious, authoritative, evidentiary; calm gravity rather than melodrama

    SUBJECT + MOTIF
    - archival evidence stacks: binders, folders, case files, ledgers, docket stacks (photographic, documentary feel)
    - visual sense of accumulation and chronology; repetition with variation
    - subtle temporal traces ONLY as paperwork artifacts: ruled lines, date-stamp textures, pagination edges (NON-readable, abstract)
    - institutional environment implied: archive table, shelving, file room depth-of-field (soft, realistic)
    - no heroic symbolism; no staged “still life” perfection
    - emphasis: evidentiary weight, volume, and recordkeeping

    EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (IMPORTANT)
    - NO clocks, NO clock faces, NO timepieces, NO hour/minute hands
    - NO allegorical symbols (scales of justice, flags as focal symbol, eagles, torches, etc.)
    - do not turn the records into a “poster”; keep it like an archival photograph

    COMPOSITION
    - Strong vertical composition suitable for 7x10 format.
    - Clean title field: generous negative space in the upper 30% (smooth, low texture).
    - Visual weight concentrated mid-to-lower frame; edges calm and low-contrast.
    - Convey scale through layered depth and repetition, not clutter.
    - Realistic lighting and depth-of-field; avoid graphic illustration cues.
    - Thumbnail test: the stacked-record motif must read as “archives / evidence” at small sizes.
