Metadata for Week 25
====================

Title
-----
Normalization as System

Subtitle
--------
A Supreme Court–blessed presidency, hollowed civil service, and militarized enforcement lock law, money, and information into a single orbit around power.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
The week when immunity, emergency, and enforcement stopped being separate stories and fused into a single operating system for power.

Synopses
--------
Long Synopsis:
Week 25 of Trump’s second term marks a shift from episodic abuses to an integrated system of control. The Democracy Clock jumps 6.2 minutes, from 10:58 p.m. to 11:04 p.m., driven by converging moves in law, bureaucracy, force, and information. The Supreme Court expands presidential immunity, narrows nationwide injunctions, and clears mass civil-service purges, while upholding harsh deportation regimes. The executive leans on emergency powers for war and tariffs, threatens federal takeovers of disfavored cities, and politicizes national security and diplomacy through loyalty-based appointments and sweeping layoffs. Immigration enforcement becomes openly militarized, with National Guard and Marines in raids, squalid detention, and dismantled DHS oversight. A sprawling budget law locks in tax cuts for the wealthy, slashes Medicaid and food aid, and supercharges enforcement budgets, even as AI firms and media platforms deepen their grip on education and economic narratives. Pockets of resistance—judges blocking birthright changes, doctors and advocates suing, lawmakers demanding files—persist, but operate inside a landscape increasingly engineered to favor impunity at the top and precarity below.

Short Synopsis:
Courts, budgets, and security forces align to normalize a presidency shielded by immunity, powered by emergency tools, and enforced through militarized raids and a politicized civil service.

- image_prompts: {"wide": "A dusk cityscape of Washington, D.C., seen from above, with the Capitol and Supreme Court buildings dimly lit while the White House glows unnaturally bright. Military vehicles and armored buses line the avenues, and federal office buildings appear half-abandoned with darkened windows. In the foreground, a large, old-fashioned clock face embedded in the pavement reads 11:04 p.m., its glass cracked. The overall style is painterly and realistic, with moody, storm-laden skies and subtle details suggesting surveillance cameras and border fences, but no recognizable politicians or text.", "square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a judge’s gavel resting on a stack of redacted legal documents, a shredded civil-service ID badge, a small barbed-wire fence encircling a miniature globe, and a stopped brass clock frozen at 11:04 p.m. In the background, blurred shelves of law books fade into shadow while a faint American flag hangs askew. Painterly, realistic style, no human faces or on-image text."}
- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock moved from 10:58 p.m. to 11:04 p.m., a 6.2‑minute jump. That large weekly shift reflects not a single crisis but the consolidation of executive immunity, politicized courts, civil-service purges, and militarized enforcement into a more durable system of democratic erosion.
