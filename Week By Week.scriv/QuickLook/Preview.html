<p class="itemText"># Week 1 Appendix: Emergencies as Operating System</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an extraordinary rupture week: a newly re‑installed president used the opening days of his term to attempt a structural re‑write of the American state. The dominant pattern is rule by executive fiat, with sweeping orders on immigration, citizenship, climate, civil service, DEI, reproductive rights, and foreign alignment, many of them plainly at odds with statute or the Constitution. Emergency powers and national‑security framings are d...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week02_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 2 Appendix: Citizenship as Executive Property</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week represents an acute acceleration of authoritarian consolidation centered on the presidency. Trump’s team simultaneously attacked multiple guardrails: mass firings of inspectors general and FBI/DOJ prosecutors, Schedule F–style politicization of the civil service, and sweeping funding freezes that attempted to override Congress’s power of the purse. In parallel, the administration pardoned or commuted sentences for January 6 offender...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 3 Appendix: Private Channels as Government</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an acute rupture week: a sitting president and a private oligarch jointly pierced multiple guardrails at once. Executive power expanded through sweeping orders on tariffs, foreign aid, immigration, LGBT rights, DEI, and religion, while Musk’s DOGE operation gained de facto control over core state functions—Treasury payments, HR databases, USAID, Education, SBA, NOAA, CMS, and even air traffic control. The Justice Department and FBI were...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 4 Appendix: Parallel State as Method of Rule</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive acceleration of authoritarian restructuring rather than isolated abuses. The Trump–Musk axis used executive orders and DOGE to hollow out the civil service, freeze or redirect science and foreign-aid funding, and move toward dismantling entire agencies (Education, CFPB, NOAA, USAID, NASA DEI). Simultaneously, justice and oversight mechanisms were attacked: the Office of Government Ethics and multiple inspectors ge...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 5 Appendix: The Neutral State Emptied Out</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week reads like a concentrated blueprint for competitive authoritarianism. The Trump–Musk DOGE project accelerates into a full-spectrum assault on the neutral state: mass firings across health, environment, safety, foreign aid, and land agencies; cancellation of collective bargaining; and court rulings that green‑light purges entrench a politicized, hollowed‑out civil service. Simultaneously, executive orders and new doctrines centralize con...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 6 Appendix: Credit Lines as Control Lines</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week represents an acute acceleration of authoritarian consolidation across nearly every democratic safeguard. The executive further centralized power through Musk’s DOGE apparatus, mass-firing plans, and unilateral spending controls, while openly defying court orders on NIH funding and foreign aid. Law enforcement and intelligence were politicized via Kash Patel and Dan Bongino’s appointments, demands for FBI agent lists, and pardons plus i...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week07_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 7 Appendix: Crony Capitalism as Governance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and crony power, paired with systematic hollowing-out of the civil service, regulatory state, and foreign policy apparatus. Trump and Musk’s DOGE machine drives mass layoffs and attempted dismantling of core agencies (Education, Social Security, VA, USPS, CFPB, IAF), while crypto and tariff policies openly intertwine public power with private enrichment. National security is reoriented awa...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 8 Appendix: Citizenship as Sorting Mechanism</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and a sharp turn toward exclusionary citizenship and weaponized law. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus drive mass firings, lease terminations, and deep cuts to education, science, health, and foreign aid, while courts begin to push back—ordering reinstatement of tens of thousands of workers and forcing transparency from DOGE and EPA. Immigr...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week09_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 9 Appendix: Law as Instrument of Defiance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an acute constitutional‑crisis week, with the executive openly defying courts while rapidly restructuring the state. The most intense pressure fell on rule of law, separation of powers, civil service neutrality, and academic and media independence. Trump’s invocation and abuse of the Alien Enemies Act, mass deportations in defiance of Judge Boasberg’s orders, and calls (backed by impeachment articles) to remove that judge collectively si...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week10_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 10 Appendix: Law as Instrument of Rule</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week is a concentrated demonstration of authoritarian consolidation through executive fiat, legal intimidation, and weaponized bureaucracy. The White House escalated its campaign against the legal system—issuing and bargaining away punitive orders against major law firms, directing the attorney general to investigate opposing lawyers, and backing impeachment threats and structural attacks on federal courts. Simultaneously, Trump signed sweeping...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week11_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 11 Appendix: Emergency Economics as Governance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was a structurally heavy week of democratic backsliding, dominated by three converging dynamics: consolidation of executive economic and security power, systematic hollowing of the civil service and knowledge institutions, and aggressive manipulation of elections and information. Trump’s declaration of a trade “national emergency” and sweeping, donor-skewed tariffs (wk011-138, -139, -170, -171, -172, -173, -176, -201, -237) sharply incr...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">week12_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 12 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, fused with a hard-right project to reorder law, economy, and memory. The White House used executive orders and emergency trade powers to bypass Congress, weaponized immigration and DOJ against critics, and directly targeted law firms, universities, and NGOs. Immigration enforcement shifted further toward mass, often lawless, deportation, with the Alien Enemies Act normalize...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week13_appendix</p>
<p class="itemText"># Week 13 Appendix: Law as Instrument, Not Limit</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week is a concentrated stress test of constitutional democracy, with the executive branch openly contesting judicial authority, weaponizing federal power against perceived enemies, and fusing policy with personal and partisan gain. The most acute structural pressure falls on the rule of law and separation of powers: the Abrego García and Alien Enemies Act cases show systematic defiance of court orders, attempts to evade contempt, and a theor...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic erosion, with the executive launching coordinated attacks on multiple guardrails while courts and civil society mounted notable, but reactive, resistance. The most acute pressures fell on rule-of-law and separation-of-powers traits: open defiance of Supreme Court orders on deportations, contempt findings, and the arrest of a sitting judge for alleged obstruction of ICE all ...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 15 Appendix: Decrees as Government</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, concentrated in executive aggrandizement, weaponization of law, and information control. Trump’s use of emergency authorities and sweeping executive orders—on tariffs, immigration, education, independent regulators, civil service reclassification, and disaster relief—pushes the system toward rule by decree and away from congressional budgeting and statutory limits. Law ...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 16 Appendix: Silence and Spectacle as Governance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an administration accelerating a multi-front restructuring of the state toward personalized, loyalty-based rule, while courts and some state actors mount scattered but meaningful resistance. The heaviest pressures fall on civil service neutrality, media independence, immigration enforcement, and scientific/public health capacity. DOGE’s mass firings, new ease of dismissing probationary employees, EPA and NIH purges, and tar...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">week17_appendix</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an administration moving from illiberal drift toward a more openly authoritarian operating model, with countervailing resistance from courts, some state governments, and civil society. Structurally, the heaviest pressure falls on rule-of-law constraints, immigration-based stratification of rights, and the fusion of foreign money with presidential decision-making. The Qatar jet and Trump Organization’s Gulf deals intertwine persona...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Week 18 Appendix: Inequality as Governance</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and partisan power across multiple fronts, with only sporadic judicial pushback. The centerpiece is passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a reconciliation mega‑package that locks in regressive tax cuts, slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and green incentives, and massively expands deportation and detention funding. That bill, combined with Moody’s downgrade, underscores how fiscal and social policy...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, a coordinated campaign against independent institutions, and intensifying stratification of rights by status and identity. Trump’s record pace of executive orders, floated suspension of habeas corpus, and defiance or end-runs around court orders push hard on unchecked presidency and normalized emergency powers. Immigration becomes the central arena: mass-arrest quotas, the planned Office ...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was a structurally heavy week of authoritarian consolidation across multiple fronts. The Trump administration advanced a sweeping agenda of executive overreach (impoundment threats, mass federal layoffs, travel bans, Harvard visa suspension), while the House pushed through the “Big, Beautiful Bill” and related reconciliation measures that slash social supports, preempt state AI regulation, and carve out industry favors. Immigration enforce...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an acute authoritarian surge centered on immigration enforcement and militarized domestic control, with spillover into media, education, civil rights, and environmental policy. The Trump administration federalized and deployed National Guard units and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections, used paramilitary-style ICE raids, and threatened or used force against protesters and journalists. These moves heavil...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a sharp erosion of protections for vulnerable groups, especially immigrants and LGBTQ people. Trump’s assertion of direct control over U.S. Steel, repeated defiance or manipulation of statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delays, National Guard federalization, DHS oversight rules), and deregulatory favors to crypto and fossil-fuel interests...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran without congressional authorization, followed by a Supreme Court decision sharply limiting nationwide injunctions. Together they expand executive freedom of action while constraining judicial remedies, directly intensifying traits 1 and 4 (unchecked executive power and law as weapon). Simultaneously, ...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week marks a major structural lurch toward authoritarian governance, anchored by passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill and a cluster of Supreme Court decisions expanding executive impunity and constraining judicial checks. The bill simultaneously entrenches plutocratic tax policy, slashes the social safety net, and massively expands immigration enforcement and detention capacity, hardwiring inequality (trait 36) and stratified...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week reflects an acute phase of authoritarian consolidation centered on executive overreach, weaponized law, and the hollowing out of the professional state. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling and its greenlighting of mass federal layoffs, combined with Trump’s unilateral use of emergency powers for tariffs, war-making, and immigration crackdowns, sharply weaken checks on the presidency (Traits 1, 4, 5, 13, 14). Simultaneously, large-sca...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, centered on three converging fronts: weaponization of the immigration and security apparatus, politicization and hollowing-out of the civil service and justice system, and a coordinated squeeze on independent information and public goods. ICE and DHS policies—ending bond hearings, rapid deportations, data-sharing from Medicaid and IRS, raids at workplaces and scho...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive consolidating power across law enforcement, regulation, information, and social policy. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fell on rule-of-law traits (4, 9, 22, 51), as DOJ and ICE were further politicized and expanded, consent decrees and police reforms were rolled back, and a new Obama-focused “strike force” signaled overt use of prosecutorial power against political e...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with emergency authorities and trade tools stretched into quasi-permanent instruments of unilateral rule. Trump’s tariff blitz—via multiple executive orders and a sweeping de minimis suspension—recasts trade law as a personal lever, while courts simultaneously hear challenges to his IEEPA-based tariff authority. Judicial independence takes a major hit: Emil Bove’s confirmation despite whis...</p>
