\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 21 Appendix: Immigration as Domestic Occupation\
\
This week shows an acute authoritarian surge centered on immigration enforcement and militarized domestic control, with spillover into media, education, civil rights, and environmental policy. The Trump administration federalized and deployed National Guard units and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections, used paramilitary-style ICE raids, and threatened or used force against protesters and journalists. These moves heavily stress traits around security forces serving regime preservation, normalization of emergency powers, and weaponization of law (traits 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 41). Parallel campaigns targeted oversight and dissent: members of Congress and a senator were physically blocked or manhandled while attempting oversight; DOJ and DHS policies expanded surveillance and criminalization of journalists, immigrants, and protesters; and courts and inspectors general faced politicized pressure (traits 1, 14, 19, 22, 23, 42\'9643, 45\'9647). Simultaneously, the administration advanced a broad culture-war and information-control agenda\'97rewriting history, censoring DEI and LGBTQ content, reshaping vaccine science bodies, and defunding public media\'97deepening structural pressure on knowledge institutions and public memory (traits 44, 55\'9660). A few judicial rulings and state lawsuits pushed back, but the week\'92s net structural force is strongly toward entrenched executive overreach and coercive governance.\

Week 21 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. Trump administration attempted to rehire federal employees cut by the Department of Government Efficiency (2025-06-07): The effort to rehire staff after aggressive DOGE cuts showed how prior politicized downsizing had impaired federal capacity to deliver basic services, underscoring how executive restructuring choices can weaken the state\'92s ability to serve the public.\
\
2. President Trump ordered large-scale ICE raids and deportation crackdowns in Los Angeles and other cities (2025-06-09): Coordinated workplace and community raids, conducted without warrants in many cases and framed as a response to a \'93Migrant Invasion,\'94 concentrated executive power over immigration enforcement and exposed immigrants and bystanders to sweeping, often opaque coercive actions.\
\
3. President Trump and senior aides demanded record ICE arrest quotas and framed LA protests as an insurrection (2025-06-09): Stephen Miller\'92s quota of 3,000 arrests per day and Trump\'92s description of protests as an \'93insurrection\'94 signaled use of immigration and security rhetoric to justify mass coercion and potential military deployment against domestic dissent.\
\
4. President Trump ordered and expanded federalization and deployment of California National Guard troops to Los Angeles over state objections (2025-06-08): Trump\'92s unilateral activation and federalization of thousands of Guard troops in California, despite state opposition and later court challenges, marked a major assertion of executive control over state military resources for domestic protest and immigration enforcement.\
\
5. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deployed and threatened further deployment of active-duty Marines to Los Angeles for protest response (2025-06-08): Ordering 700 Marines into Los Angeles and warning of additional mobilization blurred the line between military and civilian policing, raising constitutional questions about using federal combat forces to manage domestic protests and immigration operations.\
\
6. President Trump publicly called for the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom (2025-06-08): Urging ICE\'92s director to arrest a sitting governor for political disagreements signaled willingness to wield federal law enforcement against elected opponents, undermining norms that protect rival officeholders from arbitrary detention.\
\
7. President Trump threatened protesters at upcoming military parades with overwhelming force (2025-06-09): Trump\'92s warnings that demonstrators at his military parades would face \'93very big\'94 or \'93very heavy\'94 force used the prospect of state violence to chill First Amendment activity around events designed to glorify his leadership.\
\
8. President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled likely extension of a 90-day pause on certain tariffs during trade talks (2025-06-12): Extending a temporary tariff pause gave the executive branch continued leverage over trade partners and domestic sectors, illustrating how unilateral tariff policy can be used as a bargaining and pressure tool with limited legislative input.\
\
9. President Trump used executive power to target and pressure multiple institutions including media, universities, and agencies (2025-06-11): Accounts of Trump\'92s pattern of using executive tools to punish disfavored institutions\'97through funding threats, appointments, and investigations\'97highlighted a governing style that treats state power as an instrument for disciplining critics.\
\
10. President Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center\'92s leadership to reshape its cultural direction (2025-06-12): Removing the Kennedy Center\'92s chair and longtime president to combat perceived \'93wokeness\'94 showed the executive branch directly intervening in a major cultural institution\'92s governance to align it with administration ideology.\
\
11. President Trump blocked California\'92s gas-car phaseout and stricter vehicle emission rules using a congressional resolution (2025-06-12): By signing resolutions overturning California\'92s authority to set tougher vehicle standards, Trump curtailed a state\'92s environmental self-governance and reinforced federal control aligned with fossil-fuel and auto interests.\
\
12. President Trump mobilized National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles as part of immigration enforcement strategy (2025-06-13): Reports that military deployment planning for immigration enforcement began months before the LA protests suggested the administration was normalizing use of armed forces as a standing tool of domestic migration control.\
\
13. President Trump issued an executive order setting conditions for Nippon Steel\'92s acquisition of U.S. Steel (2025-06-13): Conditioning a major foreign acquisition on a national security agreement with CFIUS showed the president using security review powers to shape cross-border investment while retaining broad discretion over industrial ownership.\
\
14. President Trump used public funds and military spectacle for a costly partisan-style parade (2025-06-12): A $40 million military parade, criticized even by some Republicans, illustrated how state resources and martial imagery were being used to stage personalist displays rather than neutral civic ceremonies.\
\
15. President Trump uninvited Senator Rand Paul from a White House congressional picnic (2025-06-12): Disinviting a senator from a routine bipartisan event over political friction, while minor on its face, reflected a pattern of using access and ceremony to reward loyalty and punish intra-party dissent.\
\
16. President Trump commented that harsh immigration enforcement was harming farmers and signaled possible policy changes (2025-06-13): Trump\'92s admission that deporting long-term undocumented farmworkers was hurting agriculture, coupled with hints of adjustment, underscored how executive enforcement choices can destabilize key labor markets and then be selectively relaxed.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom filed lawsuits challenging Trump\'92s federalization of the California National Guard (2025-06-09): California\'92s suits argued that Trump\'92s deployment of the Guard to Los Angeles violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded statutory authority, testing judicial checks on federal use of state military forces in domestic policing.\
\
2. Federal courts in Texas and elsewhere blocked or limited Trump immigration deportation initiatives under the Alien Enemies Act (2025-06-09): A ruling halting deportations to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act and requiring time to contest designations showed courts acting as a partial brake on expansive executive claims in immigration law.\
\
3. Federal judiciary ruled against Trump\'92s deployment and federalization of California National Guard and Marines, then faced appellate stays (2025-06-12): District Judge Breyer\'92s orders finding the Guard deployment unlawful, and a separate ruling against troop use in LA, were quickly stayed by the Ninth Circuit, illustrating both judicial resistance and the fragility of constraints on executive security moves.\
\
4. Federal courts in Massachusetts and Washington, DC blocked Trump\'92s executive order requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections (2025-06-13): Injunctions against an order mandating citizenship proof and empowering federal funding cuts to noncompliant states protected voter access and reaffirmed that the president lacks unilateral authority to rewrite election rules.\
\
5. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired the acting counsel to the intelligence community inspector general and installed a loyal adviser (2025-06-09): Removing the IG counsel and replacing them with a direct report raised alarms that intelligence oversight mechanisms were being politicized, weakening internal checks on abuses in the national security apparatus.\
\
6. Pentagon inspector general investigated Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\'92s aides over possible deletion of encrypted messages (2025-06-07): A probe into whether senior defense aides were told to delete Signal messages about sensitive dealings with Elon Musk highlighted concerns over record-keeping, transparency, and potential obstruction within the defense hierarchy.\

\
8. Department of Justice indicted Representative LaMonica McIver for allegedly impeding immigration officers during oversight activity (2025-06-11): Charging a sitting member of Congress over conduct tied to detention-center oversight blurred the line between neutral law enforcement and political retaliation, potentially chilling legislative scrutiny of executive detention practices.\
\
9.

\
10. Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi reversed protections for journalists\'92 records and expanded subpoena powers to cover leaks undermining Trump\'92s agenda (2025-06-10): Rolling back Biden-era limits on seizing reporters\'92 records and targeting leaks that \'93undermine\'94 the president\'92s agenda broadened DOJ\'92s authority to surveil journalists, threatening press independence and whistleblower channels.\
\
11. Department of Homeland Security and ICE leadership denied congressional and mayoral access to immigration detention facilities and arrested local officials (2025-06-09): Blocking members of Congress and a mayor from inspecting detention centers, and arresting Newark\'92s mayor during an attempted visit, showed federal agencies resisting oversight and using criminal charges to deter scrutiny.\
\
12. Senator Alex Padilla and federal security agencies clashed over his forcible removal and handcuffing at DHS press events (2025-06-12): The physical removal and brief detention of Senator Padilla while he attempted to question DHS about troop deployments and raids highlighted executive security forces obstructing legislative oversight in real time.\
\

\
15. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission acting chair Andrea Lucas ordered gender-identity discrimination cases deprioritized and halted (2025-06-13): Directing the EEOC to stop processing gender-identity claims and dismiss pending cases effectively suspended enforcement of protections for trans and nonbinary workers, weakening a key civil-rights enforcement institution.\
\

Kennedy Jr. dismissed and replaced the CDC\'92s vaccine advisory committee with controversial appointees (2025-06-10): Firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and appointing figures known for vaccine skepticism politicized a core scientific advisory body that shapes national immunization policy.\

Economic Structure\
\
1.

\
5.

\
11. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City signed an order adopting a broad definition of antisemitism for city agencies (2025-06-09): Requiring agencies to use the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which can encompass some criticism of Israel, risked chilling protected speech and protest on Middle East policy in the nation\'92s largest city.\
\
12.

\
13. Departments of Veterans Affairs and State banned pride flags and similar symbols in government offices and consular posts (2025-06-10): Prohibiting pride flags in federal workplaces and embassies curtailed LGBTQ+ visibility in official spaces, signaling state disapproval of queer identities and limiting expression by public servants.\
\
14. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stopped processing gender-identity discrimination complaints and removed nonbinary markers from forms (2025-06-13): Halting enforcement of gender-identity claims and erasing \'93X\'94 gender options effectively denied trans and nonbinary workers access to a key civil-rights remedy, stratifying workplace protections by identity.\

\
25. Trump administration and ICE planned to send thousands of immigrants to Guantanamo Bay without notifying home countries (2025-06-10): Using an offshore military prison for immigration detention would place migrants in a legal gray zone far from courts and advocates, echoing past practices that sidestepped ordinary constitutional protections.\
\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1. President Trump issued executive orders to create a National Garden of American Heroes and restore contested monuments (2025-06-08): Plans for a statue garden and orders to reinstate removed monuments aimed to enshrine a celebratory version of U.S. history in public space, privileging certain figures and narratives over more critical or inclusive accounts.\
\
2. President Trump announced restoration of Confederate names for Army bases (2025-06-10): Reversing Congress\'92s decision to remove Confederate names from military bases re-centered symbols of rebellion and white supremacy in official military memory, complicating efforts at racial reckoning.\
