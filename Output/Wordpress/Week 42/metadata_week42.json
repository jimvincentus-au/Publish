    "square": "A 1:1 symbolic still life: a heavy presidential pardon document with an ornate seal lies atop a worn SNAP benefits card and a folded court order, all resting on a cracked marble pedestal. Beside them, a small model of a grand crystal ballroom rises from the rubble of a demolished office wing, and a pair of handcuffs encircles a miniature passport marked with an indistinct sex marker. A faint reflection of a clock face appears in the polished marble surface. Painterly, realistic, high detail, no text.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of the National Mall under a darkening sky, the Capitol dome partially shrouded in scaffolding and shadow while the White House East Wing lies in rubble beside a rising, opulent ballroom shell. In the foreground, a long line of people wait outside a closed food assistance office, guarded by heavily armed, masked officers. Overhead, faint contrails of military jets cross the sky. A large, old-fashioned clock face is superimposed in the clouds, its hands frozen, gears visible and straining behind the glass. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "In Week 42 of Trump\u2019s second term, the Democracy Clock\u2019s hands stayed fixed at 8:11 p.m., but the machinery behind them strained. The White House openly defied court orders to pay full SNAP benefits during a prolonged shutdown, turning hunger and federal payrolls into bargaining chips while Congress repeatedly failed to reopen government. Judges ordered compliance, yet the administration appealed, treating rulings as negotiable. Simultaneously, the Justice Department narrowed the War Powers Resolution, Trump mused about using the Insurrection Act beyond judicial review, and Congress declined to constrain potential strikes in Venezuela. Immigration enforcement hardened into a quasi-military, partly privatized regime of raids, expanded detention, and data-driven tracking of children. A major tax cut for the wealthy, secret health-care donations funding a $300 million White House ballroom, and elite-friendly pardons fused public policy with private gain. Courts and voters mounted pockets of resistance, but executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and curated memory advanced another step.",
