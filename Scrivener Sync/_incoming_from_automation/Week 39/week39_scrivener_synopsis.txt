Week 39 of Trump’s second term shows democracy eroding through accumulation rather than spectacle. The government shutdown became a laboratory for executive dominance: more than 4,000 federal workers faced layoffs, a sweeping hiring freeze put expertise behind political veto, and watchdogs were fired even as courts scrambled to halt illegal terminations. Federal money and force were redirected to reward allies and punish disfavored regions, from canceled tunnels and flood defenses to selective disaster declarations. Abroad, foreign cash and arms deals intertwined with Trump family and ally finances, making crony capitalism indistinguishable from policy. Law enforcement and national security tools were turned inward: Antifa labeled terrorism, belief systems flagged as violent, protest organizers and journalists surveilled, sued, or manhandled. Universities, judges, and local officials mounted pockets of resistance, but the cost of saying no rose. The Democracy Clock’s face stayed at 11:24 p.m., yet its gears moved 0.7 minutes closer to midnight.
