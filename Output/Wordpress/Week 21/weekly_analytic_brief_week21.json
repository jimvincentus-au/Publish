    "Executive branch: The presidency asserts de facto emergency powers over state security functions, immigration enforcement, and information policy, using executive orders and agency directives to bypass or stretch statutory limits.",
    "Judiciary: Federal courts still check some overreach (election order, Alien Enemies Act deportations, troop deployments), but rapid appeals and partial stays reveal a contested, fragile barrier rather than a settled constraint.",
    "Congress and state governments: Democratic lawmakers and blue-state executives attempt legal and rhetorical pushback, yet face physical exclusion, criminal charges, and targeted deployments that weaponize federal power against opposition jurisdictions.",
    "Civil service and agencies: Key enforcement and regulatory bodies (DHS, DOJ, EEOC, HHS, EPA, education authorities) are increasingly politicized, with mandates redirected toward ideological goals and repression rather than neutral administration.",
    "Media and cultural institutions: Public broadcasters, Voice of America, major networks, and museums experience direct political pressure, while some legacy institutions (e.g., Smithsonian) still demonstrate pockets of institutional resistance."

  "summary": "This week is a concentrated demonstration of authoritarian drift centered on immigration enforcement and militarized domestic governance. The Trump administration federalized and deployed thousands of National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections, used them in proximity to protests, and tolerated at least one direct military detention of a civilian. Parallel ICE and DHS operations featured warrantless raids, mass arrests (including citizens and elected officials), denial of counsel and congressional access, and aggressive crowd-control tactics against protesters and journalists. The executive simultaneously pushed to criminalize dissenting speech, expand surveillance of immigrants and journalists, and weaponize DOJ and FCC powers against media and political opponents. Structural attacks on independent institutions deepened: politicized appointments at HHS, EEOC, IRS, and cultural bodies; sidelining of civil rights enforcement for LGBTQ workers; and sweeping efforts to control curricula, public broadcasting, and DEI-related research and grants. Courts and states mounted notable resistance\u2014blocking parts of Trump\u2019s election order, Alien Enemies Act deportations, and some deployments\u2014but appellate stays and ongoing defiance show how far executive power is testing legal boundaries. Overall, the week exerts heavy pressure on civil-military norms, rule of law, and the informational environment that sustains democratic accountability.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Militarization of domestic politics: Federalization of the California National Guard, deployment of Marines, and Guard activations in multiple states normalize military tools for protest management and immigration enforcement.",
    "Immigration as a vehicle for authoritarian experimentation: Mass raids, data-sharing, speech-based arrests, and Guant\u00e1namo plans turn non-citizens into a testbed for rights erosion and executive impunity.",
    "Systematic obstruction and intimidation of oversight: Members of Congress, a senator, mayors, and union leaders face denial of access, arrest, or indictment when scrutinizing detention and enforcement practices.",
    "Coordinated assault on independent knowledge systems: Public broadcasters, universities, scientific advisory bodies, and statistical agencies are targeted through funding, appointments, censorship, and legal threats.",
    "Narrative control through misinformation and culture war: Executive orders on history, Confederate base names, book bans, and media retaliation work alongside disinformation about protests to reshape public memory and justify force."
