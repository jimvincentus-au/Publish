<h1>Week 4 Appendix: DOGE as Parallel Statecraft</h1>
<p><em>Trump and Musk quietly converted the federal bureaucracy into a pliable, privatized instrument, using money, law, and memory to tilt power inward and downward.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive acceleration of authoritarian structural change, centered on executive aggrandizement, civil service purge, and information control, partially checked by unusually assertive courts and civil society. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus moved from rhetoric to implementation: mass layoffs, buyout schemes, and a new hiring choke-point effectively politicize and shrink the federal workforce, while attempts to shutter or hollow out USAID, Education, CFPB, NIH, NSF, NOAA, NASA DEI, and Social Security operations rewire the administrative state toward loyalist and private interests. Simultaneously, the administration paused FCPA enforcement, meddled in DOJ corruption cases, and signaled possible debt repudiation, fusing crony capitalism with legal impunity. On the rights side, immigration crackdowns, anti-trans orders, DEI erasure, and militarized ICE practices deepen stratified citizenship. Information space is sharply contested: federal web purges, Pentagon school book removals, AP bans, and curated DOGE data sit alongside court orders restoring health pages and blocking NIH cuts. Internationally, Gaza annexation talk and resource-for-support demands on Ukraine reveal a transactional, destabilizing foreign policy. The judiciary, inspectors-general lawsuits, state suits, and mass public calling campaigns provide real but embattled counter-pressure.</p>
