The order claims these programs constitute \"illegal discrimination\" and mandates federal agencies to identify potential civil compliance investigations into organizations implementing DEI initiatives. The order suggests that DEI programs unfairly disadvantage white men, framing them as victims of discrimination. This move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to dismantle DEI initiatives, which they argue undermine traditional American values.",

The group seeks an injunction to prohibit any consideration of race in student admissions and requests the appointment of a court monitor to oversee admission decisions. The University of California has stated it has not been served with the filing and intends to defend its practices.",
