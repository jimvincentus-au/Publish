<h1>Week 21 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance</h1>
<p><em>In Los Angeles and beyond, immigration raids, troop deployments, and cultural decrees showed how emergency tools can be normalized as everyday management.</em></p>
<p>This week is a concentrated demonstration of authoritarian drift centered on immigration enforcement and militarized domestic governance. The Trump administration federalized and deployed thousands of National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections, used them in proximity to protests, and tolerated at least one direct military detention of a civilian. Parallel ICE and DHS operations featured warrantless raids, mass arrests (including citizens and elected officials), denial of counsel and congressional access, and aggressive crowd-control tactics against protesters and journalists. The executive simultaneously pushed to criminalize dissenting speech, expand surveillance of immigrants and journalists, and weaponize DOJ and FCC powers against media and political opponents. Structural attacks on independent institutions deepened: politicized appointments at HHS, EEOC, IRS, and cultural bodies; sidelining of civil rights enforcement for LGBTQ workers; and sweeping efforts to control curricula, public broadcasting, and DEI-related research and grants. Courts and states mounted notable resistance—blocking parts of Trump’s election order, Alien Enemies Act deportations, and some deployments—but appellate stays and ongoing defiance show how far executive power is testing legal boundaries. Overall, the week exerts heavy pressure on civil-military norms, rule of law, and the informational environment that sustains democratic accountability.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump ordered the deployment and federalization of National Guard troops to Los Angeles over state objections: Trump’s unilateral activation and federalization of California’s National Guard to police immigration protests, despite opposition from state leaders, expanded executive control over state military forces and blurred limits on domestic use of troops. (2025-06-08)</li>
<li>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deployed and threatened further deployment of active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to support immigration enforcement: Sending 700 active-duty Marines, and threatening more, to back immigration raids and protest control in Los Angeles pushed military forces into civilian law enforcement roles normally constrained by law and custom. (2025-06-08)</li>
<li>President Trump publicly threatened protesters at his military parade with overwhelming force: Trump’s warnings that parade protesters would face “very big” or “very heavy” force signaled willingness to use state violence against peaceful assembly, chilling dissent around a leader-focused military display. (2025-06-09)</li>
<li>President Trump called for the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom over immigration policy disputes: By urging federal officials to arrest a sitting governor for policy disagreements, Trump blurred lines between political conflict and criminality, pressuring law enforcement to target an elected rival. (2025-06-08)</li>
<li>President Trump issued a directive framing Los Angeles protests as a violent “Migrant Invasion” and ordered cabinet action to “liberate” the city: Labeling protests as an invasion and riots provided rhetorical cover for extraordinary enforcement and military measures, recasting dissent and immigrant presence as threats to national sovereignty. (2025-06-09)</li>
<li>President Trump labeled Los Angeles protests an insurrection and floated invoking the Insurrection Act: Describing protests as an insurrection and hinting at Insurrection Act use normalized treating domestic dissent as rebellion, lowering the bar for military intervention in civil life. (2025-06-09)</li>

(2025-06-12)</li>
<li>President Trump blocked California’s gas-car phaseout and stricter vehicle emission rules via resolution: Overturning California’s clean-car rules curtailed a state’s ability to pursue ambitious climate policy, centralizing environmental authority in a deregulatory federal executive. (2025-06-12)</li>
<li>President Trump used executive power to target disfavored institutions and critics: Trump’s pattern of using executive orders and agency pressure against media, universities, and states illustrated how presidential tools can be wielded to punish opposition rather than neutrally govern.

<li>President Trump issued an executive order conditioning approval of Nippon Steel’s acquisition of U.S. Steel on a national security agreement: By revising a prior block on a major foreign acquisition, Trump used CFIUS-linked authority to balance economic openness with security concerns, signaling how strategic industries can be governed through discretionary security reviews.

<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration over federalization of the California National Guard: California’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s Guard deployment sought judicial clarification of federal limits over state military forces, testing constitutional protections for state sovereignty and checks on executive power.

<li>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee and moved to replace them: Firing 17 independent vaccine advisers and installing controversial replacements politicized a core scientific advisory body, risking that immunization policy would reflect ideology rather than evidence.

<li>Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi reversed limits on subpoenaing journalists’ records to target leaks that “undermine” Trump’s agenda: Expanding DOJ authority to seize reporters’ records for leaks deemed harmful to the president’s agenda turned national-security tools into instruments for policing political narratives. (2025-06-10)</li>
