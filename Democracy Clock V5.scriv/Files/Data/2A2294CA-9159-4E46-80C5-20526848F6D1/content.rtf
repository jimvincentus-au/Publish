\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 41 traces how a government turns crisis into structure. The Democracy Clock\'92s public time holds at 7:59 p.m., yet a fractional tick toward midnight captures the tightening scaffolding of authoritarian rule. The White House East Wing is demolished for a corporate-funded Trump ballroom, arts and planning commissions are purged, and immigration, health, and diplomatic bureaucracies are rewired around loyalty and fear. Pardons, defense contracts, and crypto schemes fuse wealth and law, while a billionaire steps in to pay troops during a shutdown that starves SNAP despite available contingency funds. Militarized immigration raids, National Guard \'93quick reaction forces,\'94 and lethal overseas strikes blur war and policing. Courts and some state officials still block the worst abuses\'97protecting food aid, voter registration, and some protest rights\'97but only through emergency litigation. The week\'92s through-line is not a single shock, but the conversion of chaos, hunger, and spectacle into a lasting architecture of control.\
