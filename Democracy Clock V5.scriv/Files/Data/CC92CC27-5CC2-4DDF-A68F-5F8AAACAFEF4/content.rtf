\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 36 is a consolidation chapter. The Democracy Clock remains at 7:58 p.m., but the landscape beneath it hardens. The administration turns law from constraint into weapon: forcing out an independent U.S. attorney, installing loyalist Lindsey Halligan, indicting James Comey, and opening probes into John Brennan and John Bolton while the Justice Department\'92s Public Integrity Section withers. Executive power stretches across domains\'97lethal strikes in Venezuela, a legally dubious antifa terrorism designation, and a domestic terrorism memorandum that invites surveillance of left-leaning nonprofits. Courts largely widen the lane, granting emergency stays that favor executive discretion over independent agencies and congressional control of foreign aid. Civil service neutrality erodes through shutdown-linked firing plans, loyalty metrics, and retaliatory reassignments. Immigration enforcement expands and brutalizes, while information control deepens via Pentagon press pledges, FCC threats, and suppression of economic and social data. States, cities, courts, and a narrow House election offer partial resistance, but the dominant story is a regime that has learned to use chaos as a governing method.\
