This move is part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests at universities, with institutions like Columbia and Harvard facing federal funding freezes despite taking disciplinary actions against student protesters. The administration's actions have led to increased disciplinary measures against students, particularly those of Palestinian, Arab Muslim, and other minority backgrounds, who are advocating for divestment from companies linked to Israel's actions in Gaza.",

      "summary": "Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer claimed that Donald Trump's recent pardons of white-collar criminals have erased over $1 billion in debts owed by wealthy Americans. These pardons included individuals convicted of financial crimes such as fraud and embezzlement, effectively wiping out their restitution obligations. Notable cases include Michele Fiore, a former politician convicted of wire fraud, and Trevor Milton, founder of an electric vehicle startup, who was convicted of fraud. Additionally, Trump pardoned the cryptocurrency exchange HDR Global Trading, eliminating a $100 million fine. Oyer described these actions as unprecedented in their financial impact.",
