Week 10 of Trump’s second term marked a shift from stretching power to rearranging it. The Democracy Clock jumped fourteen minutes, from 9:45 to 9:59 p.m., on the strength of coordinated moves rather than a single shock. A sweeping executive order recast voter registration under the banner of “integrity,” demanding documentary proof of citizenship, tightening mail‑ballot rules, and opening state voter rolls to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Parallel orders gutted collective bargaining for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and carved national security agencies out of labor law, while a DOGE operative slipped into the Social Security Administration despite a court’s attempt to wall off its data.

Universities and migrants were sorted by ideology and origin: grants to Columbia were frozen, foreign students and scholars were detained or threatened with deportation, and the Alien Enemies Act was used to send Venezuelans to El Salvador’s mega‑prison in defiance of judicial orders. Law firms that had represented Trump’s adversaries faced existential executive orders; some capitulated with massive pro bono pledges, others sued. At the same time, senior officials used auto‑deleting Signal chats to plan airstrikes, even as Trump ordered museums and the Smithsonian to purge “divisive” history. Courts, journalists, unions, and civil society still pushed back, but the week’s pattern was unmistakable: law, archives, and public memory were being refashioned into instruments of control.
