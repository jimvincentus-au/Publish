<h1>Week 10 Appendix: Voter Rolls as Leverage</h1>
<p><em>A quiet executive blitz rewired elections, immigration, law, and information systems to make the state more tool than commons, with courts mostly reacting at the edges.</em></p>
<p>This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with multiple fronts moving simultaneously. The most acute pressure fell on electoral access and federalism: the executive order mandating documentary proof of citizenship and empowering DOGE to access voter lists represents a major, potentially enduring shift toward voter suppression and centralized control over elections. Immigration and citizenship policy were weaponized through data-sharing between IRS and ICE, social media vetting, aggressive deportation tactics, and threats of offshoring detainees, deepening stratified citizenship. The executive also expanded its reach over the civil service, law enforcement priorities, and independent agencies, while using tariffs, funding cuts, and targeted executive orders to reward allies and punish adversaries, fusing crony capitalism with governance. Civil liberties came under rhetorical and practical attack as protesters were labeled “domestic terrorists,” political speech was chilled, and surveillance expanded. Courts provided some counter-pressure—blocking parts of the trans military ban, DOGE data access, Alien Enemies Act use, and preserving Sullivan and Radio Free Europe funding—but these wins only partially offset a week dominated by executive overreach, structural voter suppression, and the normalization of law as a weapon rather than a constraint.</p>
