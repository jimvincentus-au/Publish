# Week 52 Appendix: Occupation as Governance

*A federal immigration surge turns Minnesota into a test site for domestic force, legal impunity, and curated memory, even as states and courts push back.*

![Header image](image_wide_week52_appendix.png)

This week shows an acute convergence of authoritarian tools around immigration enforcement, foreign adventurism, and information control. The Minneapolis–St Paul ICE surge, the killing of Renee Nicole Good, and subsequent shootings are the central axis: federal agents deployed at unprecedented scale, used lethal force, altered crime scenes, blocked state investigators, and were shielded by DOJ decisions and smear campaigns. That cluster drives heavy pressure on traits 4, 8, 9, 11, 41, 42, 43, 47, 50 and 53. Parallel moves—threatening the Fed chair with criminal charges, politicized probes of lawmakers and whistleblower counsel, and the FBI raid on a Washington Post reporter—extend the weaponization of law and security institutions (traits 1, 4, 6, 14, 18, 22, 23, 42). Internationally, the Venezuela operation, seizure of oil revenues, and open talk of invading or annexing Greenland, backed by tariffs and NATO-skeptical rhetoric, reveal an expansionist, transactional foreign policy that fuses crony capitalism with militarized leverage (traits 1, 10, 38, 40, 56). There is meaningful resistance—state lawsuits, ACLU class actions, congressional field hearings, impeachment articles, and mass protests—but these operate as reactive brakes against a rapidly consolidating executive-centered regime.

Power and Authority

1. Trump administration seized control of Venezuelan oil and its revenues without full congressional involvement (2026-01-10): The administration’s unilateral seizure and personal control of Venezuelan oil revenue bypassed normal congressional oversight, concentrating foreign economic power in the executive and weakening checks on how seized assets are used.

2. President Donald Trump withheld $129 billion in federal funding from Minnesota citing alleged fraud (2026-01-10): Trump’s move to cut massive federal funds to Minnesota in the midst of an immigration crackdown used fiscal power to punish a disfavored state, pressuring local authorities and residents through economic coercion.

3. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over Venezuelan oil revenue and blocked repayments (2026-01-12): By framing Venezuelan oil revenue as a national emergency and blocking repayments via executive order, Trump expanded emergency economic powers with limited oversight, normalizing crisis tools for long-term foreign asset control.

4. President Donald Trump threatened criminal charges against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates (2026-01-12): Trump’s threat to criminally prosecute the Fed chair for not cutting rates politicized independent monetary policy, signaling willingness to use prosecutorial power to coerce economic decisions that should be insulated from partisan demands.

5.

6. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on any country doing business with Iran (2026-01-12): Trump’s unilateral global tariff threat against countries trading with Iran used U.S. market power as a coercive foreign policy tool, risking trade retaliation and bypassing broader legislative debate on sanctions strategy.

7. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally censured Senator Mark Kelly and ordered an investigation into reducing his retirement grade (2026-01-13): Hegseth’s censure and push to downgrade Senator Kelly’s military rank for criticizing unlawful orders blurred lines between civilian oversight and military discipline, signaling executive willingness to punish legislators through military channels.

8. President Donald Trump publicly threatened Minnesota with a coming "day of reckoning and retribution" (2026-01-13): Trump’s threat of a "day of reckoning" for Minnesota amid ICE operations used presidential rhetoric to intimidate a dissenting state, reinforcing the idea that federal power may be wielded punitively against political opponents.

9. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota to respond to protests (2026-01-15): Trump’s repeated threats to deploy the military under the Insurrection Act against Minnesota protesters signaled readiness to treat civil dissent as insurrection, eroding norms that separate domestic policing from military force.

10. President Donald Trump refused to extend Affordable Care Act premium subsidies (2026-01-16): The administration’s refusal to extend ACA subsidies risked pricing many people out of coverage, using executive inaction on health policy to reshape access to care without new legislation.

11. President Donald Trump publicly defended the ICE agent who killed Renee Good and labeled her a domestic terrorist (2026-01-16): By defending the ICE agent and branding Renee Good and her wife as "domestic terrorists" before investigations concluded, Trump signaled executive backing for lethal force and framed critics as enemies of the state.


Institutions and Governance
