<h1>Week 23 Appendix: Secrecy as War-Making Method</h1>
<p><em>Unauthorized strikes, militarized immigration raids, and curated intelligence fused into a week where executive power acted first and explained, if ever, later.</em></p>
<p>This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran, framed with manipulated intelligence and followed by efforts to restrict congressional access to classified assessments. That campaign, combined with domestic troop deployments against immigration protesters, normalizes emergency-style executive power and blurs civil–military boundaries. Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is weaponized at scale: masked raids, record detentions, deaths and medical neglect in custody, expansion of private detention, and plans for massive new camps like “Alligator Alcatraz” collectively signal a system where law is a tool of fear rather than a limit on state power. The Supreme Court’s decisions narrowing nationwide injunctions and limiting Medicaid patients’ ability to sue, together with a hard-right immigration docket, structurally weaken judicial checks just as the executive and DOJ test open defiance of court orders. Information and knowledge systems are also targeted: mass firings at Voice of America, threats and investigations against journalists, politicization of vaccine and health science bodies, and pressure on universities and DEI infrastructure. Against this, there are pockets of resistance—federal judges rebuking ICE and DOJ abuses, state and civil society lawsuits, and a high-profile progressive electoral win in New York—but they operate in an environment of accelerating authoritarian drift.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Donald Trump ordered large-scale airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities without congressional authorization: Trump’s unilateral bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, conducted without a declaration of war or clear imminent threat, concentrated war-making power in the executive and sidestepped constitutional checks on the use of force.
