    "Congress functioned largely as a transmission belt for the executive, bypassing the parliamentarian and GAO, stretching reconciliation rules, and passing a sweeping bill that reorients federal spending toward enforcement and elites.",
    "The Supreme Court moved decisively toward an executive-friendly posture, limiting nationwide injunctions, expanding presidential immunity, and greenlighting restrictive citizenship and deportation practices while taking up further culture-war cases.",
    "The administrative state was both politicized and repurposed: HHS, EPA, FCC, OSHA, and education funding decisions show regulators serving ideological and donor agendas over technocratic or statutory missions.",
    "Law enforcement and homeland security agencies deepened their alignment with executive political goals, from ICE raids and detention conditions to arrests of opposition officials and threats against journalists and universities.",
    "State and local actors, plus some federal judges and attorneys general, emerged as partial counterweights\u2014suing over asylum bans, TPS, Medicaid data-sharing, and mental health cuts\u2014but without the structural leverage to offset federal consolidation."

  "summary": "This week marks a major structural lurch toward authoritarian governance, anchored by passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill and a cluster of Supreme Court decisions expanding executive impunity and constraining judicial checks. Fiscal and social policy were aggressively re-engineered to favor capital over labor and natives over immigrants, with deep, long-horizon cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare, while massively expanding ICE, detention infrastructure, and defense spending. Simultaneously, the Court narrowed nationwide injunctions and reaffirmed sweeping presidential immunity, sharply weakening courts as a counterweight. Law enforcement and immigration tools were overtly weaponized against political opponents, local officials, journalists, and even judges, while DOJ denaturalization guidance and birthright-citizenship maneuvers stratified citizenship itself. Information control intensified through threats to CNN, source-compulsion talk, shutdown of a federal climate site, and politicized appointments. A few judicial and state-level pushbacks on asylum, TPS, HHS firings, and data-sharing show residual resistance, but the net effect is a coordinated consolidation of executive-centered, exclusionary, and oligarchic rule, with multiple traits of democratic decay both worsened and entrenched in law.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Legislative hardwiring of authoritarian priorities: the megabill locks in tax advantages for the wealthy, historic cuts to the safety net, and unprecedented ICE and defense funding, embedding inequality and coercive capacity in statute.",
    "Judicial de-clawing and executive impunity: Supreme Court rulings on immunity, nationwide injunctions, and birthright citizenship sharply reduce courts\u2019 ability to constrain presidential power or protect uniform rights.",
    "Immigration as central tool of repression: mass funding for detention, harsh raids, denaturalization drives, TPS termination attempts, and threats to deport even citizens turn immigration law into a generalized instrument of fear.",
    "Weaponization of law enforcement and justice: arrests of judges and elected officials, politicized pardons, denials of oversight access, and DOJ threats against media show law operating as a regime weapon, not a neutral constraint.",
    "Information and knowledge infrastructure under attack: threats to prosecute CNN, pressure on universities, shutdown of climate and science functions, and conspiracist appointments erode independent knowledge systems needed for accountability."
