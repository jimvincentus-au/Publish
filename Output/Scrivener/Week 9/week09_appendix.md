# Week 9 Appendix: Law as Instrument of Defiance

This was an acute constitutional‑crisis week, with the executive openly defying courts while rapidly restructuring the state. The most intense pressure fell on rule of law, separation of powers, civil service neutrality, and academic and media independence. Trump’s invocation and abuse of the Alien Enemies Act, mass deportations in defiance of Judge Boasberg’s orders, and calls (backed by impeachment articles) to remove that judge collectively signal an executive claiming supremacy over the judiciary. In parallel, the administration moved to dismantle or rewire major institutions—the Department of Education, USAID, USAGM/VOA, DEI infrastructure, Social Security operations, and independent regulators like the FTC—often via Musk’s DOGE apparatus. Universities and international broadcasters were punished financially for perceived ideological noncompliance, while immigration and terrorism frames were used to target activists and foreign scholars. Courts did push back, blocking parts of the deportation regime, DOGE’s data grabs, the USAID shutdown, and some anti‑LGBTQ and climate rollbacks. But the sheer volume of unilateral orders (92 in two months), combined with selective noncompliance and retaliatory rhetoric, shows a presidency testing whether legal constraints are still binding or merely advisory.

Week 9 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members and continued flights despite a federal restraining order (2025-03-15): Using an 18th‑century wartime statute to deport migrants without normal process, and pressing ahead after a judge’s order to stop flights, concentrated unchecked removal power in the presidency and sidelined judicial limits.

2. President Trump ordered US airstrikes in Yemen without congressional authorization (2025-03-16): Launching lethal strikes in Yemen without seeking Congress’s approval expanded unilateral war‑making authority and weakened legislative checks on the use of force.

3. President Trump declared that President Biden’s pardons were void because they used an autopen signature (2025-03-16): Claiming power to nullify a predecessor’s pardons challenged the finality of clemency and suggested presidential authority can be retroactively rewritten for political ends.

4. President Trump used a Justice Department speech to air grievances about his own criminal cases (2025-03-15): Turning a Justice Department policy address into a platform for personal score‑settling blurred the line between impartial law enforcement and the president’s private legal interests.

5. President Trump urged Republicans to back a partisan stopgap funding bill to avert a shutdown (2025-03-15): The president’s direct pressure on his party to pass a long stopgap bill shaped budget outcomes from the White House, reinforcing executive leverage over Congress’s power of the purse.

6. President Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg after rulings limiting deportations (2025-03-19): Demanding impeachment of a federal judge for adverse immigration rulings threatened judicial independence and signaled that courts should align with executive preferences or face retaliation.

7. Representative Brandon Gill filed articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg following Trump’s criticism (2025-03-19): Introducing impeachment articles against a judge over a specific deportation order used Congress’s removal power to punish judicial review of executive actions.

8. Chief Justice John Roberts publicly rebuked calls to impeach Judge Boasberg over his rulings (2025-03-18): The Chief Justice’s statement that impeachment is not a remedy for disagreement with decisions defended judicial independence against partisan efforts to intimidate judges.

9. President Trump revoked Secret Service protection for Joe Biden’s adult children (2025-03-17): Stripping security details from a predecessor’s family departed from customary protections and suggested security resources could be allocated based on political rivalry.

10. President Trump revoked security clearances from several political and legal opponents (2025-03-21): Revoking clearances from named rivals weaponized access to classified information as a political tool rather than a neutral security judgment.

11. President Trump revoked a prior punitive executive order against law firm Paul Weiss after it agreed to policy changes (2025-03-21): Tying revocation of sanctions on a law firm to its internal policy commitments showed how executive orders can be used to pressure private legal actors’ practices.

12. President Trump revoked Temporary Protected Status–style legal status for about 530,000 immigrants from four countries (2025-03-21): Ending parole protections for over half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela abruptly exposed them to deportation, using executive discretion to reshape the legal landscape for large immigrant groups.

13. President Trump revoked security clearances and Secret Service protections from named political figures and families in a broader pattern of retaliation (2025-03-21): Combining clearance revocations and protection changes against opponents signaled that core state security tools could be repurposed to punish political adversaries rather than protect institutions.


Institutions and Governance

1. President Trump signed an order eliminating the US Agency for Global Media and dismantling Voice of America and related outlets (2025-03-15): Shutting down USAGM and sidelining VOA and sister broadcasters dismantled a long‑standing public media institution and removed a major channel for independent, congressionally funded journalism.

2. President Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, leaving it without a quorum (2025-03-18): Removing opposition commissioners from the FTC crippled a key competition regulator and signaled that independent commissions could be purged for partisan advantage.

3.

4. President Trump ordered the Department of Government Efficiency to move against the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other agencies (2025-03-21): Using DOGE to send staff home, install new leadership, and cancel grants at a small cultural agency showed how a parallel executive structure could be used to dismantle congressionally funded institutions.

5. President Trump signed an order granting DOGE broad access to unclassified federal records and systems and eliminating information silos (2025-03-19): Centralizing access to agency data under a politically led efficiency office expanded executive control over administrative information flows and weakened traditional departmental autonomy.

6. President Trump issued executive orders on state and local preparedness, consolidated procurement, and accelerated mineral production (2025-03-19): New orders shifting preparedness to states, centralizing procurement in GSA, and fast‑tracking mining permits restructured how core federal functions are coordinated and who controls major spending and resource decisions.

7. Department of Government Efficiency and Secretary Pete Hegseth shut down USAID operations until blocked by a federal court (2025-03-18): Attempting to dismantle USAID via executive action, later ruled likely unconstitutional, showed how foreign aid and development institutions could be unilaterally hollowed out despite congressional mandates.

8. President Trump gutted the board of the US Institute of Peace and asserted control over the congressionally funded nonprofit (2025-03-17): Removing the Institute of Peace’s board and asserting executive authority over its governance undermined the independence of a peace‑promotion body created by Congress.

9. President Trump signed an order targeting law firm Perkins Coie and continued attacking Democratic‑aligned firms after a court block (2025-03-17): Using executive orders to single out specific law firms representing political opponents blurred the boundary between neutral regulation and punitive use of state power against legal adversaries.

10. Department of Veterans Affairs and Trump administration moved to phase out gender‑affirming care for veterans under an anti‑trans order (2025-03-17): Directing VA to end gender‑affirming care reoriented a major federal health system away from equal service provision, signaling that access to benefits can be narrowed by identity.

11. Department of Education under Trump administration halted processing of income‑driven student loan repayment plans, prompting lawsuits (2025-03-19): Stopping access to income‑driven repayment programs without clear statutory basis shifted a core federal benefit away from millions of borrowers and invited judicial intervention to enforce congressional mandates.

12. Social Security Administration leadership planned and began implementing ID‑heavy changes that would force more in‑person benefit claims (2025-03-18): SSA’s new identity‑proofing rules, expected to flood already strained field offices, risked degrading service delivery and access to benefits for elderly, disabled, and low‑income claimants.

13. Social Security Administration froze the Enumeration Beyond Entry program that auto‑issues Social Security numbers to new workers and citizens (2025-03-20): Quietly suspending automatic SSN issuance for newly authorized workers and citizens threatened to overwhelm field offices and delay access to work and benefits for tens of thousands weekly.

14. Department of Government Efficiency and IRS leadership fired thousands of IRS employees and misrepresented the firings as performance‑based (2025-03-20): Mass IRS firings, falsely framed as performance problems, weakened tax administration capacity while eroding trust in official explanations for major staffing changes.

15. Federal courts issued multiple rulings blocking or limiting Trump administration initiatives, including DEI rollbacks, USAID dismantling, DOGE data access, climate grant clawbacks, and a trans military ban (2025-03-18): Judges across several cases checked executive efforts to reshape civil rights, foreign aid, data access, climate funding, and military service rules, underscoring the judiciary’s role as a counterweight despite political pressure.

16. Judge James Boasberg repeatedly ordered halts to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and demanded explanations for noncompliance (2025-03-21): Boasberg’s restraining orders and follow‑up demands sought to enforce legal limits on emergency‑style deportations, testing whether judicial directives still bind the executive in practice.

17. Chief Justice John Roberts and other judges publicly criticized disrespectful DOJ filings and defended judicial processes in deportation litigation (2025-03-21): Judicial leaders’ rebukes of the administration’s tone and tactics in deportation cases highlighted concern that executive lawyers were undermining respect for the courts as co‑equal institutions.

19. Democratic state attorneys general filed and enforced multiple lawsuits securing temporary restraining orders against Trump administration directives (2025-03-21): Coordinated state litigation that won TROs against firings, funding freezes, and other directives showed subnational officials using courts to contest federal overreach.

20. Department of Justice sought to remove Judge Boasberg from the deportation case and argued his orders lacked authority over flights (2025-03-19): DOJ’s attempt to disqualify a judge and narrow his jurisdiction over deportation flights signaled institutional resistance to judicial oversight of contested executive actions.

22. Congress and President enacted the Full‑Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 (2025-03-15): Passing a full‑year continuing appropriations law kept federal agencies funded but relied on stopgap mechanics that weaken regular budget deliberation and entrench crisis‑driven governance.

23. Senate Democratic leadership advanced and helped pass a Republican funding bill over internal opposition (2025-03-15): Democratic leaders’ decision to move a GOP‑written funding bill, despite activist and caucus resistance, revealed strategic tradeoffs between opposing the administration and preventing a shutdown.

24. Senator Glenn Ivey called for Chuck Schumer’s removal as Senate Democratic leader over the funding bill (2025-03-19): A public intra‑party challenge to Schumer’s leadership over budget strategy highlighted fractures in opposition coordination against the administration’s agenda.

25. Federal courts and litigants handled high‑profile civil cases including Greenpeace’s defamation loss and a bribery indictment tied to NYC contracts (2025-03-19): A massive defamation verdict against Greenpeace and ongoing payments to an indicted developer raised concerns that civil and criminal processes can yield outcomes favoring powerful corporate and political actors.

26. Federal courts granted the Trump administration a 60‑day extension in mifepristone lawsuits (2025-03-18): Allowing extra time in abortion‑pill litigation opened space for a potential policy shift that could restrict access, illustrating how procedural rulings can shape substantive rights.

27. Federal courts blocked DOGE from accessing Social Security data and ordered deletion of collected personal information (2025-03-21): Judicial orders halting DOGE’s Social Security data trawl and requiring destruction of records protected privacy and checked an expansive, weakly justified search for “fraud and waste.”

28. Federal courts barred deportation of academics and activists over alleged political ties, including Badar Khan Suri and Mahmoud Khalil (2025-03-20): Orders protecting pro‑Palestinian scholars from deportation on political‑view grounds reaffirmed constitutional limits on using immigration law to punish speech.

29.

Federal agencies (EPA, FCC, TSA, FDA, OSHA) issued routine rules and information‑collection notices on air quality, alerts, security, and medical standards (2025-03-20): Ongoing technical rulemakings on emissions, emergency alerts, airport security, and device standards showed core regulatory machinery continuing to function amid broader institutional turmoil.


Economic Structure

1. Trump administration and Department of Education cut or froze hundreds of millions in federal funding to Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania over campus policies (2025-03-20): Withdrawing $400m from Columbia and freezing $175m for Penn tied federal research and program money to universities’ handling of protests and trans inclusion, using economic leverage to shape academic policy.

2.

3. Trump administration and DOGE implemented deep cuts and firings at the IRS, USDA inspection teams, and National Nuclear Security Administration (2025-03-18): Large‑scale staff reductions at revenue, food‑safety, and nuclear‑security agencies weakened state capacity to collect taxes, protect supply chains, and manage the arsenal, while being publicly framed as anti‑waste measures.

4. EPA leadership under Lee Zeldin announced plans to roll back or eliminate 31 pollution regulations and gut the Office of Research and Development (2025-03-19): Scaling back major air and water rules and planning to fire over 1,000 EPA scientists shifted regulatory policy toward industry interests at the expense of long‑term public health and climate protections.

5. HUD and Interior secretaries under Trump announced a plan to open protected federal lands for housing construction and mining (2025-03-17): Proposing development and extraction on protected lands reoriented public resources toward private housing and mining projects, trading conservation and shared goods for near‑term economic gains.

7. President Trump and DOGE installed Starlink internet across the White House and benefited from FAA contract shifts to Musk’s Starlink (2025-03-18): Embedding Starlink in White House infrastructure and steering a major FAA contract away from Verizon toward Musk’s firm deepened reliance on a politically connected contractor for critical communications.

8. Trump administration terminated a contract supporting tracking of abducted Ukrainian children and withdrew from a Ukraine invasion investigation body (2025-03-18): Ending support for documenting Russian child abductions and leaving an accountability body weakened international legal efforts while signaling a softer stance toward Moscow.

9. Trump administration and Republican Party planned large tax cuts expected to significantly increase the national debt amid high interest rates (2025-03-16): Pursuing major tax cuts without offsetting spending in a high‑debt, high‑rate environment risked future fiscal stress that could justify cuts to social programs.

10. President Trump issued an order to consolidate federal procurement under GSA (2025-03-20): Centralizing procurement authority in GSA promised efficiency but also concentrated contracting power, increasing the stakes of political influence over vendor selection.

11. President Trump issued an order to expedite domestic mineral production on federal lands (2025-03-20): Fast‑tracking mining permits and prioritizing federal lands for extraction favored resource industries and shifted environmental and community risks onto the public.

12. Social Security Administration froze the Enumeration Beyond Entry program and tightened ID rules, increasing in‑person visits for benefits and SSNs (2025-03-20): SSA’s unannounced freeze and new ID policy threatened to overwhelm offices and delay access to work authorization and benefits, especially for immigrants, the elderly, and disabled people.

13.

15. Republican‑controlled state legislatures advanced bills to reclassify mifepristone as a controlled substance and add liability for providers (2025-03-18): State moves to treat mifepristone like opioids and expose providers to lawsuits used criminal and civil law to restrict a key healthcare product despite federal approval.

Civil Rights and Dissent

1. Trump administration and ICE conducted mass deportations to El Salvador and Lebanon despite court orders, often misidentifying migrants as gang members (2025-03-17): Deporting hundreds, including a Brown professor and Venezuelan migrants, in defiance of judicial stays and on thin evidence like tattoos showed immigration powers being used without reliable process or respect for court protection.

2. Trump administration and DHS targeted pro‑Palestinian activists and academics like Mahmoud Khalil, Badar Khan Suri, and Jeanette Vizguerra for detention and deportation (2025-03-19): Arresting and seeking to deport outspoken Palestinian‑rights advocates and scholars under terrorism‑adjacent or foreign‑policy provisions blurred the line between immigration enforcement and punishment of political speech.

3. ICE and CBP detained foreign nationals and residents under harsh conditions, including a German green‑card holder, a Canadian worker, and a family with a child recovering from brain surgery (2025-03-19): Reports of abusive detention, denial of urgent medical care, and coercive interrogations of lawful residents and vulnerable people highlighted systemic rights violations in border and immigration custody.

4. ICE and DHS intensified arrests and deportations of Chinese immigrants nationwide, including in sanctuary cities (2025-03-18): Stepped‑up raids and charter flights targeting Chinese nationals, even in sanctuary jurisdictions, expanded enforcement against a specific national group and spread fear in immigrant communities.

Trump administration and DHS revoked temporary legal status for over 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (2025-03-21): Ending parole protections for hundreds of thousands of people from specific countries abruptly exposed them to deportation, stratifying security and rights by nationality.

6. Trump administration and DOJ framed deported migrants as dangerous gang members while affidavits admitted many had no criminal records (2025-03-20): Official claims that deportees were vetted gang members, despite internal acknowledgments of clean records, used stigmatizing narratives to justify sweeping removals.

7. Trump administration and El Salvador’s government deported migrants to a Salvadoran “terrorism confinement centre” and shared footage of shackled, shaved detainees (2025-03-16): Sending migrants to a harsh foreign prison and publicizing humiliating images turned deportation into a spectacle of punishment, raising serious human‑rights concerns.

8. Texas authorities arrested a midwife for allegedly providing an abortion under the state’s near‑total ban (2025-03-17): The first criminal arrest under Texas’s abortion ban showed how post‑Roe laws can expose providers to decades in prison, chilling reproductive healthcare.

9. Trump administration and HHS proposed allowing H5N1 bird flu to spread among US farms to identify immune animals (2025-03-19): A controversial suggestion to let bird flu circulate in livestock prioritized speculative benefits over clear public‑health safeguards, risking both animal and human populations.

10. Trump administration and DOJ charged Tesla vandals with domestic terrorism and Trump called for 20‑year El Salvador sentences for such acts (2025-03-21): Labeling property damage against Tesla as domestic terrorism and urging extreme foreign imprisonment for vandals escalated protest‑related crimes into national‑security offenses.

11.

13. Trump administration and DHS requested that Cornell PhD student Momodou Taal surrender to immigration authorities days after he sued over protest‑related deportation orders (2025-03-21): Summoning a student plaintiff into custody soon after he challenged executive orders in court suggested immigration powers were being used to intimidate litigants.

Information, Memory and Manipulation

1. White House and USAGM leadership under Trump eliminated the US Agency for Global Media and shut down Voice of America and related outlets (2025-03-15): Closing US‑funded international broadcasters removed a major source of independent journalism and soft power, narrowing the range of publicly supported news reaching global audiences.

3. President Trump and allies claimed Biden’s pardons were invalid due to autopen signatures despite archival clarification (2025-03-17): Persisting in autopen‑based attacks on Biden’s pardons after the National Archives explained standard signature practices spread doubt about lawful acts to delegitimize opponents.

4.

Pentagon and Air Force under Trump removed DEI‑related training and online content about Tuskegee Airmen, Code Talkers, and other minority veterans (2025-03-18): Deleting and relabeling pages on minority service members and DEI history, then partially restoring them after backlash, showed an official effort to recast military memory away from diversity narratives.

7.

Trump administration and DOJ removed disability and DEI‑related content from federal websites while courts partially restored some pages (2025-03-18): Systematic deletion of guidance and history tied to disability and diversity, only partly reversed under pressure, showed how web curation can reshape what the public can learn about rights and inclusion.

Power and Authority

1. President Donald Trump used a Justice Department speech to air personal grievances about his own criminal cases (2025-03-15): The president’s use of a Justice Department policy speech to attack his own prosecutors blurred the line between personal legal battles and neutral law enforcement, pressuring an agency that should operate independently of the executive’s private interests.

2. President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize arrests and deportations of noncitizens without normal due process (2025-03-15): Invoking an 18th‑century wartime statute to summarily detain and deport noncitizens expanded presidential power over immigration beyond peacetime norms, weakening judicially supervised procedures that normally constrain executive removal authority.

3. Trump administration continued deportations to El Salvador despite a federal court order halting flights under the Alien Enemies Act (2025-03-16): Proceeding with mass deportation flights after a judge’s restraining order signaled open defiance of judicial authority, undermining checks on executive power and weakening confidence that court rulings can constrain presidential directives.

4. President Donald Trump declared that President Biden’s pardons were void because they were signed by autopen (2025-03-16): Claiming unilateral power to nullify a predecessor’s pardons challenged the settled finality of clemency decisions and suggested that legal protections granted by one administration could be revoked at will by the next.

5. President Donald Trump targeted Democratic‑aligned law firms with executive orders and public attacks (2025-03-17): Using executive power to single out law firms representing political opponents threatened the independence of legal representation and signaled that access to justice could be chilled by partisan retaliation from the presidency.

6. President Donald Trump removed the board of the US Institute of Peace and installed executive control (2025-03-17): Seizing control of a congressionally funded peace institute by ousting its board concentrated foreign‑policy influence in the executive branch and weakened an institution meant to provide independent expertise and oversight.

7. Department of Veterans Affairs under President Donald Trump announced it would phase out gender‑affirming medical care for veterans (2025-03-17): Ending gender‑affirming care for veterans used executive control over health benefits to restrict a vulnerable group’s access to medically recognized treatment, signaling that rights can be narrowed by administrative fiat.

8. President Donald Trump revoked Secret Service protection for Joe Biden’s adult children (2025-03-17): Stripping security protection from a predecessor’s family appeared retaliatory and politicized a core protective function, raising concerns that basic safety resources could be granted or withdrawn based on partisan conflict.

9. President Donald Trump ordered US airstrikes in Yemen without congressional authorization (2025-03-16): Launching lethal strikes abroad without seeking congressional approval further normalized unilateral war‑making by the executive, weakening legislative checks on the use of force and democratic control over foreign military engagements.

10. President Donald Trump signed an order eliminating the US Agency for Global Media and dismantling Voice of America and related outlets (2025-03-15): Shuttering the government’s international broadcasting agency and sidelining its journalists concentrated control of state‑funded messaging in the executive, weakening an established channel for independent news and soft‑power diplomacy.

11. President Donald Trump signed an executive order dismantling the US Department of Education and directing its closure (2025-03-20): Ordering the shutdown of a congressionally created cabinet department by executive action alone challenged separation of powers and threatened federal enforcement of civil‑rights and funding guarantees in education nationwide.

12. President Donald Trump issued an executive order to close the Department of Education and return authority to states and communities (2025-03-20): Framing the dismantling of the federal education department as empowerment of states masked a major central decision to withdraw national standards and protections, deepening regional disparities in educational rights and resources.

13. President Donald Trump signed an executive order granting the Department of Government Efficiency broad access to unclassified federal records and systems (2025-03-19): Expanding a politically aligned efficiency unit’s access to agency data and software systems increased centralized executive visibility into operations, raising risks of politicized audits and surveillance of the civil service.

14.
