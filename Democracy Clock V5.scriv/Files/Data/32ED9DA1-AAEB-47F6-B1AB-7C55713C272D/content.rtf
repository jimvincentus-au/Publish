\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 16 records no visible movement of the Democracy Clock, but the stillness is deceptive. Executive power continued to expand through technical orders and personnel choices that hollowed out neutral expertise and redirected public institutions toward loyalist ends. Public and international media were dismantled or defunded, with Voice of America sidelined, NPR and PBS stripped of support, and One America News invited into the state\'92s information infrastructure. The civil service absorbed mass firings and politicized appointments across Labor, EPA, HHS, FEMA, FAA, and USAID, while watchdogs and inspectors general were sidelined. Immigration and security policy hardened into a quasi-permanent emergency, with vast ICE expansion, deputized agents, and punitive confrontations with dissenting governors and mayors. Law was repeatedly used as a weapon\'97pardons for January 6 figures, investigations of critics, and selective enforcement\'97yet courts also blocked some deportations and election subversion. Civil society, students, lawyers, and a few state governments mounted visible resistance, keeping the overall risk level steady even as the system\'92s internal wiring shifted.\
