\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 3 Appendix: Private Channels as Government\
\
This was an acute rupture week: a sitting president and a private oligarch jointly pierced multiple guardrails at once. Executive power expanded through sweeping orders on tariffs, foreign aid, immigration, LGBT rights, DEI, and religion, while Musk\'92s DOGE operation gained de facto control over core state functions\'97Treasury payments, HR databases, USAID, Education, SBA, NOAA, CMS, and even air traffic control. The Justice Department and FBI were purged of those who investigated Trump and January 6, civil rights and police-reform enforcement was halted, and foreign-influence and kleptocracy units dismantled. Inspectors general were removed across agencies. Simultaneously, information systems were manipulated: CDC and climate data vanished, ICE rewrote its own history, and media access at the Pentagon and FCC was weaponized. Abroad, Trump launched a trade war, froze USAID, sanctioned the ICC, withdrew from UN human-rights bodies, and openly proposed a U.S. takeover of Gaza and harsher uses of Guant\'e1namo. Courts, unions, states, and Congress mounted notable resistance\'97blocking the fund freeze, birthright-citizenship order, trans-prison transfers, and the federal buyout deadline\'97but these were defensive actions against a coordinated drive toward personalized, chaotic, and highly privatized rule.\
