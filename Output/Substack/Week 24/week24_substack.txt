The twenty-fourth week of Trump’s second term unfolded as a week of hardwiring. What had been signaled in speeches and trial balloons in earlier weeks was now written into statute, case law, and budget lines. The pattern was not a single shock but a set of converging moves: a vast tax-and-spending package, a Supreme Court willing to shield the presidency and fragment rights, and an immigration and enforcement system expanded and repurposed as a tool of rule. The surface language was familiar—growth, security, order—but the underlying work was to redraw who counts, who pays, and who can say no. That was the point.

At the start of Week 24, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:01 p.m. By the end, it read 8:02 p.m., a net movement of 0.3 minutes. The numerical shift was small, but it captured a week in which executive power became more insulated from oversight, law was used more openly as a weapon, and the basic terms of citizenship and social protection were tilted toward exclusion and hierarchy. Congress, courts, and agencies all played roles in this shift. Some judges and state officials pushed back at the margins, but the center of gravity moved toward a presidency less constrained by law and a state more organized around enforcement and inequality.

The core of the week’s structural change was the One Big Beautiful Bill. Trump and Republican leaders promoted it as a sweeping tax-and-spend package that would, in their telling, unleash growth and restore fiscal sanity. In practice, the bill made permanent the 2017 tax cuts and layered on new breaks skewed toward higher earners and capital. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the package would add at least $3.3 trillion to the deficit, even as Treasury officials insisted, against the data, that growth would pay for itself. The Senate adopted a “current policy baseline” that treated trillions in tax cuts as costless, masking their true budgetary impact. The dollar posted its worst first-half performance since the early 1970s, and the economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, but these warning lights did not alter the bill’s course. They were treated as noise.

On the spending side, the megabill restructured the welfare state downward. It advanced roughly $930 billion in Medicaid cuts, with projections that 11.8 million people would lose coverage. It slashed SNAP by $186 billion and shifted costs to states, weakening the federal role in fighting hunger. It phased out enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, accepting that millions more would become uninsured. Medicare faced more than $500 billion in cuts over nine years, and the bill terminated coverage for some legal immigrants who had paid into the system, explicitly tying access to origin and status. Trump signed these provisions into law, including measures that ended Medicare for certain noncitizen seniors and imposed stricter work requirements on Medicaid and SNAP recipients. The effect was to move health and food security from a shared guarantee toward a conditional, more easily withdrawn benefit.

At the same time, the bill poured money into the security state. Congress and the president approved an additional $158 billion in defense spending, pushing annual military outlays past the trillion-dollar mark. New funds flowed to missile defense, ships, and nuclear weapons, reinforcing a military-industrial pattern with little public debate about tradeoffs. Immigration enforcement received $172 billion, including $45 billion for new jails, and ICE’s budget was boosted to near Army levels. Trump signed bills that dramatically increased detention capacity and hiring, reallocated billions to border wall construction, and raised the debt limit by $5 trillion to accommodate these priorities. The Federal Communications Commission, for its part, suspended rules capping prison and jail phone rates until 2027, preserving high costs and kickback structures that burden incarcerated people and their families. In foreign aid, researchers warned that USAID cuts embedded in the fiscal package could lead to more than 14 million additional global deaths by 2030, underscoring how domestic budget choices reverberate abroad.

The megabill also targeted specific institutions and services aligned with disfavored groups. Trump signed a one-year Medicaid ban on Planned Parenthood affiliates, effectively defunding many clinics that serve low-income patients for reproductive and general care. He approved measures that withheld nearly $7 billion in K–12 funding for after-school, language, and adult education programs, and his administration had already terminated over $1 billion in school-based mental health funds. These moves, combined with deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, shifted fiscal and social risk onto households and states while preserving tax advantages and subsidies for corporations and high-income individuals. Policy outcomes were written around donor and corporate interests, with fossil fuels and defense contractors among the clear winners.

If the bill was the substance, the way it moved through Congress was the method. The Senate used reconciliation to fast-track the package, advancing it through narrow procedural votes that limited debate. The parliamentarian initially ruled that several provisions violated reconciliation rules, underscoring that internal constraints still existed on paper. Trump responded by urging Republican senators to ignore the parliamentarian’s guidance, and Senate leaders obliged, bypassing both the parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office on key questions about tax cuts and EPA waiver rollbacks. By adopting a baseline that treated permanent tax cuts as having no cost, they altered budget scoring norms in a way that obscured the true fiscal impact from the public. That was a choice.

The final Senate vote on the budget bill was 51–50, with Vice President Vance breaking the tie. That razor-thin margin illustrated how slim majorities can enact far-reaching structural changes under reconciliation rules. In the House, the Freedom Caucus initially criticized the bill’s deficits, and some members balked at its size and content. But Trump and House leaders applied intense pressure, warning of primary challenges and other consequences for dissenters. The House kept a procedural vote open for more than two hours—far longer than usual—while leadership worked the floor to flip holdouts. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick broke with his party on a key vote and privately warned Trump about the risks of cutting Ukraine aid, but party operatives reportedly tried to locate and pressure him. In the end, the House accepted the Senate bill largely unchanged, and Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill and related legislation despite broad public opposition.

Alongside this extraordinary use of procedure, much of the administrative state continued to issue routine notices. EPA extended comment periods on major environmental impact statements, added contaminated sites to the Superfund list, and adjusted compliance deadlines for emission rules. The Food and Drug Administration processed patent determinations and information collections. The FCC and TSA updated paperwork requirements. These normal-seeming actions provided a backdrop of continuity even as the central fiscal architecture was being hollowed out and repurposed. The contrast underscored how authoritarian-leaning change can proceed through the same channels that carry ordinary governance. It can look like business as usual.

If Congress was being bent into a transmission belt, the Supreme Court was reshaping the legal terrain on which executive power rests. The Court issued a landmark ruling granting presidents absolute criminal immunity for official acts. This decision sharply weakened the prospect of holding a sitting or former president criminally accountable for abuses carried out under the color of office. In parallel, the Court limited federal judges’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential policies. In Trump v. CASA and related cases, it curbed lower courts’ capacity to provide uniform relief, insisting that remedies be narrower and more localized. A follow-on decision further restricted nationwide relief against presidential actions, making it harder for a single judge to halt an unlawful policy across the country.

These doctrinal shifts had immediate consequences. When Trump issued an executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, the Court allowed partial enforcement while barring nationwide injunctions. That meant the policy could take effect in some jurisdictions but not others, fragmenting a core constitutional guarantee along geographic lines. In another case, the Court cleared the way for deportation of eight men from a U.S. base to South Sudan despite torture concerns, signaling deference to executive deportation decisions even in life-or-death situations. At the same time, the Court agreed to hear a challenge to coordinated campaign spending limits backed by top Republican committees, suggesting openness to further loosening constraints on money in politics. The docket itself told a story.

The Court also moved deeper into the culture-war docket. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, it ruled that parents may opt their children out of LGBTQ+ themed lessons on religious grounds, a decision that risked encouraging curricular censorship and marginalizing queer identities in public education. It agreed to hear appeals on state bans that bar transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity, positioning itself to reshape civil rights protections for trans youth. These moves, combined with the immunity and injunction decisions, pointed toward a judiciary more aligned with executive and donor preferences and more willing to carve out exceptions from inclusive civic norms.

Not all judicial action ran in one direction. A federal district court ruled Trump’s asylum ban and “invasion” proclamation unlawful, reaffirming statutory and constitutional limits on presidential power over immigration. Another judge temporarily blocked mass firings at the Department of Health and Human Services as arbitrary and capricious, protecting civil servants from a politicized purge. Courts also halted the termination of Temporary Protected Status for up to 500,000 Haitians and rejected the administration’s effort to detain a Georgetown scholar pending deportation. These rulings showed that pockets of judicial independence remained. Yet they operated within a new framework in which the president enjoyed broad immunity, nationwide injunctions were curtailed, and the Court itself was setting the terms of who could be protected and where.

Immigration and citizenship were the domains where these structural changes were most visible and most personal. The megabill’s vast enforcement funding entrenched ICE as a quasi-military force, with a budget approaching that of the Army and tens of billions earmarked for new jails and border infrastructure. Trump visited a new detention complex in the Florida Everglades—dubbed Alligator Alcatraz—and promoted it as a flagship project. The facility, built in a remote wetland and run through private contractors, drew protests from hundreds of demonstrators and a lawsuit from environmental and immigrant-rights groups. Democratic lawmakers were denied entry when they attempted to inspect conditions, a direct rebuff to congressional oversight.

On the ground, ICE raids and detention practices reflected the new priorities. Agents conducted aggressive operations that swept up long-resident immigrants, including family members of veterans. Reports described overcrowding, lack of basic necessities, and poor medical care in detention centers. In Los Angeles, ICE agents were filmed urinating on a high school campus before a raid, prompting calls for investigation and highlighting a culture of impunity. The administration attempted to deport a stateless Palestinian woman, Ward Sakeik, in defiance of a federal court order, underscoring a willingness to disregard judicial authority in individual cases. Bhutanese refugees deported from the United States found themselves facing removal from Nepal as well, illustrating how U.S. enforcement decisions could leave people stranded between legal systems.

Legal tools were reworked to support this enforcement-heavy regime. The administration began sharing Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security to aid immigration enforcement, blurring the line between health services and policing and raising fears that immigrants would avoid care. A coalition of twenty state attorneys general sued to block the data-sharing, arguing that it violated privacy protections and misused health systems. The Department of Justice issued guidance prioritizing civil denaturalization cases, where targets lack a right to counsel, expanding the state’s power to revoke citizenship with limited safeguards. Trump’s team moved to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, threatening lawful status for hundreds of thousands, though a federal injunction temporarily halted the effort.

At the same time, the administration tightened student visa rules, proposing frequent renewal requirements that would disrupt international education flows and increase administrative burdens. Trump announced plans to end birthright citizenship by executive order, signaling a willingness to unilaterally redefine a constitutional boundary. He publicly floated the idea of deporting even U.S.-born citizens who commit crimes, blurring the line between citizenship and deportable status. Representative Marge Greene introduced a bill to redo the census on a citizens-only basis for apportionment, a move that would reduce representation for diverse areas with many noncitizens. In Georgia, local authorities appointed an election denier to a county board of elections, embedding skepticism of multiracial electorates into the machinery of election administration.

These moves were not uncontested. Judges blocked the TPS termination and resisted some detention demands. States sued over Medicaid data-sharing. Industry groups like the National Restaurant Association warned that immigration crackdowns were harming labor-dependent sectors and lobbied for targeted relief. But the overall trajectory was clear: immigration law and status were being turned into flexible instruments of repression, creating a stratified citizenship regime in which origin, wealth, and political alignment shaped one’s security. Citizenship itself was being graded.

Law enforcement and security forces were both empowered and politicized in parallel. Trump issued an executive order indemnifying and enhancing protections for law enforcement officers, providing legal resources and new penalties for officials deemed obstructive. This shifted power toward security forces and away from local accountability mechanisms. The megabill’s massive funding for ICE, detention, and defense further entrenched a security-state posture. At the same time, the administration removed funding to enforce contempt of court orders, weakening courts’ practical ability to compel compliance from officials and agencies.

On the ground, this translated into a pattern of shielded force. ICE raids continued despite reports of abusive conditions. The Alligator Alcatraz facility opened under a cloud of rights and environmental concerns, yet lawmakers were barred from inspecting it. In Alabama, the state law enforcement agency refused to release body-camera footage in the police killing of Jabari Peoples, limiting public scrutiny and undermining trust in investigations. The Department of Justice appointed a January 6 defendant as an adviser on alleged “weaponization” issues, and Trump nominated a conspiracy-promoting lawyer to lead the Office of Special Counsel, which is supposed to protect whistleblowers and enforce ethics rules. These appointments signaled that loyalty and ideological alignment, not commitment to the rule of law, were the criteria for key oversight roles.

Abroad, Trump’s approach to force was equally personalized. He ordered large-scale airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities without clear congressional authorization, underscoring expansive war-making power with limited democratic oversight. He later admitted that he had allowed Iran to bomb a U.S. air base in retaliation, raising questions about opaque command decisions with major security implications. The Senate voted down a resolution that would have restricted his ability to escalate war with Iran, leaving presidential authority in this domain largely unchecked. In another arena, Trump threatened to condition U.S. aid to Israel on the handling of Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial, signaling a willingness to leverage state resources to influence foreign judicial processes for political allies.

Information, science, and education systems were also bent toward political control. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assumed direct control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the absence of a director and dismissed seventeen independent vaccine advisers. This move politicized public health guidance and weakened independent scientific input at a time when trust in vaccines and health institutions was already fragile. At the Environmental Protection Agency, plans were laid to cut at least 1,000 scientists from the research arm and replace it with a smaller unit, even as the agency launched a lab animal adoption program that drew favorable attention. Hundreds of EPA employees, scientists, and academics signed a declaration warning that agency policies were undermining its mission, an internal act of dissent that underscored the stakes.

The administration shut down the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s public climate website, removing a key source of federal climate information from public view. This step, combined with the adoption of budget baselines that hid the cost of tax cuts, illustrated how data could be curated or erased to support preferred narratives. In education, the administration withheld school-based mental health funds and K–12 grants, prompting a multistate lawsuit and raising concerns about politicized allocation of resources essential to student well-being. A federal judge’s injunction against mass firings at HHS showed that administrative law standards still had force, but the broader trend was toward politicized control over knowledge-producing institutions.

Universities found themselves under direct pressure. The House passed a budget that raised the endowment tax to 21 percent for wealthy institutions like Stanford, signaling a willingness to use tax policy to reshape higher education finance and autonomy. The administration sent a letter threatening Harvard with loss of federal funding over contested antisemitism claims, raising concerns that civil-rights enforcement was being used as a lever to influence campus governance and speech. In a separate agreement, the University of Pennsylvania, under federal pressure, adopted guidelines that barred trans women from women’s sports and erased Lia Thomas’s records from its history. This decision linked educational policy and civil rights to federal leverage and exemplified how recent events could be rewritten to align with current political priorities.

The Supreme Court’s rulings on parental opt-outs from LGBTQ+ curricula and its decision to hear trans sports bans reinforced this trajectory. Together with the UPenn agreement and the firing of a Catholic school teacher over his same-sex marriage, they signaled a move toward a tiered rights regime in which LGBTQ+ inclusion and recognition could be curtailed through a mix of state power and institutional compliance. Isolated countercurrents existed—the Privy Council in London upheld same-sex civil partnerships in the Cayman Islands, and Zohran Mamdani won a ranked-choice Democratic mayoral primary in New York City despite presidential attacks—but they did not alter the overall direction.

Media, critics, and opposition figures faced a coordinated mix of legal, rhetorical, and financial pressure. Border Czar Tom Homan and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem urged the Department of Justice to investigate and potentially prosecute CNN over its coverage of an app that helped immigrants track ICE activity. Trump suggested that his administration might compel reporters to reveal anonymous sources in a national security case, threatening a core protection for investigative journalism. He refiled a lawsuit against an Iowa pollster and newspaper in state court over unfavorable polling, continuing a pattern of using civil litigation to pressure media and election-related critics. Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a dispute over a critical 60 Minutes interview, prompting Senator Elizabeth Warren to call for an anti-bribery probe into whether the settlement reflected monetization of presidential influence over media behavior.

The White House also used its platform to smear political opponents. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt falsely labeled Zohran Mamdani a communist and antisemite from the briefing room, while Trump attacked him on social media as a “Communist Lunatic” and threatened to punish New York City financially and deport him over policy disagreements. Trump called for investigations into opponents such as former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, framing policy disputes as grounds for criminal inquiry. The Social Security Administration sent a misleading email claiming that Trump’s tax bill eliminated Social Security taxes for seniors, an official communication that misrepresented policy and risked confusing beneficiaries. Universities were again drawn into this web, with funding threats and endowment taxes used as tools to shape campus speech and governance.

Oligarchic actors did not stand outside this system; they were both participants and targets. Elon Musk denounced the budget bill as “utterly insane,” launched a new “America Party,” and vowed to fund primary challengers against Republicans who supported the legislation. His wealth and media reach allowed him to shape narratives and electoral incentives around fiscal policy. Trump responded by suggesting that Musk should be deported and threatening to cut subsidies to his companies, demonstrating how immigration and economic levers could be wielded against even the most powerful critics. At the same time, Iran-linked hackers threatened to release stolen emails from Trump associates, highlighting foreign actors’ ability to manipulate domestic narratives through cyber intrusions.

Across these domains, the moral floor continued to deteriorate. The president’s unilateral decisions on war and immigration prioritized personal and partisan interests over public duty. Ethical boundaries between public office and private gain blurred, from the launch of a luxury Trump Fragrances line while in office to undisclosed dark-money payments to senior officials. Restraint was scarce: executive orders and budget maneuvers pushed the outer edge of what rules technically allowed, and when norms or advisory bodies stood in the way, they were bypassed or purged. Disinformation about the megabill’s impacts and immigration policies flowed from official channels, while civil society and some media outlets struggled to correct the record at scale.

There were, nonetheless, signs of resilience. Some congressional leaders and judges pushed back against unauthorized military actions, mass firings, and sweeping immigration orders. State attorneys general sued over Medicaid data-sharing and school mental health cuts. Election administrators scheduled open, livestreamed meetings on voting system certification, and EPA extended comment periods on major environmental projects. Civil society organizations mobilized against Alligator Alcatraz and other enforcement expansions, and internal dissent at agencies like EPA and HHS showed that professional norms had not vanished. These actions did not reverse the week’s structural shifts, but they preserved lines of contestation that might matter in later periods.

Week 24 thus marked not a sudden break but a consolidation. The One Big Beautiful Bill locked in a fiscal and enforcement architecture that privileges capital and coercion over social protection. The Supreme Court’s decisions expanded presidential impunity and narrowed judicial checks, especially in immigration and campaign finance. Immigration and citizenship were recast as flexible tools of repression, with enforcement capacity expanded and legal protections thinned. Law enforcement and security forces were indemnified and politicized, while information, science, and education systems were bent toward ideological control. Media and critics faced escalating intimidation, and civil rights eroded along predictable lines of identity and alignment.

The clock’s modest movement captured this pattern of deepening erosion without open rupture. Rights and procedures still existed, but using them now demanded more persistence and carried greater risk. Oversight mechanisms remained on paper, yet their practical leverage diminished. The week’s significance lay in how easily authority advanced and how much of that advance was written into durable law.
