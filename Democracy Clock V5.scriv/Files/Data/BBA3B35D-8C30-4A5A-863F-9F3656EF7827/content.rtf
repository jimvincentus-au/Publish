\f0\fs26 \cf0 Metadata for Week 22\
====================\
\
Title\
-----\
Law as Instrument of Fear\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A week when raids, troops, and regulations were openly steered toward enemies and donors, even as millions marched to insist the republic has no king.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
The hour does not change, but the tools of state power are retuned\'97away from public defense and toward fear, loyalty, and selective belonging.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 22 unfolds as a tightening, not a rupture. The Democracy Clock\'92s face stays at 7:52 p.m., but 30 traits edge further toward authoritarianism, especially where law, force, and information converge. The presidency federalizes Guard units over California\'92s objection, deploys Marines against immigration protests, and threatens disaster aid to punish disfavored states. Immigration raids are redirected toward \'93Democrat Power Centers,\'94 while a Palestinian activist, a journalist, and New York\'92s comptroller are swept into detention or arrest, illustrating law as a weapon rather than a limit. Simultaneously, birthright citizenship is attacked, visas become ideological filters, and a $5 million \'93Trump Card\'94 offers residency for the wealthy. Regulatory agencies and courts deliver favors to GEO Group, crypto allies, and fossil fuel interests, blurring governance with crony capitalism. Voice of America is gutted, Juneteenth and civil-rights symbols are dimmed, and political violence claims a Minnesota legislator. Against this consolidation, courts, Congress, and massive \'93No Kings\'94 protests mount visible but embattled resistance.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
Beneath an almost static Democracy Clock, federal power is openly weaponized: raids, troops, regulators, and symbols are steered toward enemies and patrons, even as millions march under \'93No Kings.\'94\

Other Metadata\

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock remains at 7:52 p.m., shifting only 0.2 minutes closer to midnight (from 471.8 to 472.0). That near-static reading masks a week of modest but broad erosion, as 30 traits move toward authoritarian consolidation while courts, Congress, and mass protests prevent a sharper break.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a judge\'92s gavel, a tarnished ICE badge, a folded American flag, and a stack of redacted legal documents bound with barbed wire. Behind them, a small television shows static where a news broadcast should be, and a framed portrait space on the wall stands empty, its outline dusty. A brass clock reads 7:52, its casing slightly dented. Painterly, realistic style, rich shadows and muted colors.", "wide": "A dusk cityscape of Washington, D.C., viewed from above: the Capitol dome and Supreme Court in shadow while the White House glows under harsh floodlights. Military vehicles and National Guard troops line nearly empty parade routes with scattered flags, while in the distance a vast crowd fills side streets holding homemade signs and American flags. A large, old-fashioned clock face is faintly superimposed in the sky, its hands near eight o\'92clock, gears visible behind cracked glass. Painterly, realistic style, moody, with strong contrasts between official spectacle and grassroots protest."\}\
