\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 43 closes with the Democracy Clock fixed at 7:59 p.m., yet the hour grows heavier. The executive branch deepened existing patterns rather than breaking new ground: weaponizing SNAP and homelessness funding, withholding economic data, and using immigration raids and overseas strikes to project discretionary force. A sweeping clemency spree for January 6 participants, 2020 election plotters, and wealthy financial offenders entrenched a two\uc0\u8209 tier justice system, reinforced by loyalist appointments and politicized prosecutions of critics. At the same time, Congress ended the record shutdown on lopsided terms, even as rank\u8209 and\u8209 file members used discharge petitions to force action on Jeffrey Epstein\'92s files and healthcare credits. Courts offered uneven resistance\'97enabling food\u8209 aid deprivation at the Supreme Court while lower courts defended fair maps, immigrants\'92 due process, and limits on domestic troop deployments. Civil society, survivors, and local organizers pressed for transparency and humane treatment. The week\'92s balance of damage and resistance kept the hands from moving, but normalized authoritarian habits.\
