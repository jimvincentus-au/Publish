  "summary": "This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarian consolidation. The executive branch used emergency powers, executive orders, and agency capture to rewrite core rules of immigration, climate, education, civil service, and media funding, often in ways that bypass or hollow out legislative and judicial checks. Immigration enforcement and the Alien Enemies Act were stretched toward collective punishment and opaque detentions, while courts and some state actors mounted important but partial resistance. Project 2025\u2013aligned moves\u2014reclassifying civil servants, dismantling the Department of Education, ending DEI and environmental justice, and subordinating independent regulators\u2014directly target institutional autonomy (traits 1, 16, 22). Simultaneously, the administration escalated information control: defunding NPR/PBS, launching a White House propaganda site, weakening reporter protections, and embedding disinformation into school curricula (traits 42\u201343, 52\u201355). Economic policy\u2014tariffs, fossil-fuel favoritism, and selective deregulation\u2014channeled public risk and crisis into insider gain (traits 26, 37, 38). A few judicial rulings and state pushbacks modestly reinforced rule-of-law boundaries, but they were outweighed by systematic efforts to normalize emergency governance, weaponize law, and stratify citizenship along ideological and ethnonational lines.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Normalization of emergency rule and executive unilateralism: border and energy emergencies, sweeping tariff powers, and mass executive orders are used to restructure core policy domains with minimal legislative input.",
    "Systematic weaponization of law and the justice apparatus: DOJ and FBI actions, pardons, FCPA and crypto-unit shutdowns, and targeted investigations of ActBlue and law firms convert legal tools into instruments of regime protection.",
    "Coordinated assault on pluralistic knowledge systems: universities, K\u201312 curricula, climate science, civil rights enforcement, and public media are simultaneously pressured, defunded, or ideologically remade to favor a Christian-nationalist narrative.",
    "Civil service and regulatory capture as a governing model: DOGE purges, Schedule F\u2013style reclassification, politicized appointments, and AI-driven deregulation hollow out neutral administration in favor of loyalist and corporate interests.",
    "Hardline ethnonational immigration regime: expansive deportations, Guant\u00e1namo plans, Alien Enemies Act abuses, birthright-citizenship attacks, and sanctuary-city punishments entrench a tiered system of rights and belonging."
