<h1>Week 12 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance</h1>
<p><em>Tariffs, deportations, and funding threats fused into a single method of rule, tightening executive control while leaving formal institutions visibly intact.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with Trump using emergency tariff authorities, immigration law, and executive orders to bypass Congress and punish perceived enemies. The tariff shock and chaotic partial pause exemplify governance by economic brinkmanship, offloading risk onto the public while insiders maneuver around the volatility. Immigration policy hardens into a mass-deportation regime: TPS holders, asylum seekers, students, and even legal residents are detained or expelled under dubious legal theories, while the IRS and Palantir data are repurposed to feed enforcement. Simultaneously, universities, law firms, NGOs, and cultural institutions are brought to heel through funding freezes, consent decrees, and retaliatory orders, eroding independent centers of knowledge and legal defense. Voting rights come under direct attack via the SAVE Act and targeted challenges to military and overseas ballots. There is some institutional resistance—federal judges protect AP access, block certain immigration terminations, and order Abrego Garcia’s return; Congress introduces bills to claw back tariff power; mass protests and civic mobilization continue—but the net structural pressure is strongly toward normalized emergency rule, weaponized law, and a stratified citizenship regime.</p>
