Title
-----
Function as Survival

Subtitle
--------
A constitutional republic endures not by form alone but by six evolving imperatives that keep power limited, conflict peaceful, and truth knowable.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
Democracy is not a set of parchment promises but a living machine whose six core functions must keep pace with the world they govern.

Long Synopsis:
This chapter steps back from weekly events to define the Six Democratic Imperatives that translate the Constitution’s promises into modern operational duties. It argues that a republic cannot survive on eighteenth‑century design alone; it must continually renew accountability, adaptability, inclusion, dignity, peace, and knowledge as living functions. Each imperative is traced from its founding roots to its present demands: independent oversight and transparency for accountability, anticipatory governance for adaptability, broad and meaningful participation for inclusion, structural protections for dignity, restrained yet effective public order for peace, and resilient information systems for knowledge. The chapter emphasizes that these are not optional virtues but interlocking requirements. When one weakens, others strain; when enough fail, the system still looks constitutional while no longer performing its democratic work. The Six Imperatives become the benchmark by which the Democracy Clock will judge whether power remains accountable and the civic covenant intact.

Short Synopsis:
A thematic chapter defines six operational imperatives—accountability, adaptability, inclusion, dignity, peace, and knowledge—as the functional system that keeps constitutional promises real in contemporary democracy.

- image_prompts: {"wide": "A painterly, realistic 16:9 scene of an old constitutional hall interior transformed into a modern control room: oak desks and parchment alongside glowing data screens, six large illuminated pillars labeled only by abstract icons for accountability, adaptability, inclusion, dignity, peace, and knowledge. Soft, moody lighting, a large clock on the wall, cables and books interwoven, suggesting an evolving but fragile democratic machine. No recognizable politicians, no text on screen.", "square": "A symbolic still life in 1:1 format: an open, weathered constitution on a wooden table surrounded by six distinct objects—a magnifying glass, a flexible metal spring, a diverse set of voting tokens, a balanced scale with a folded coat, an unlit olive branch, and a clear glass prism refracting light onto the page—evoking accountability, adaptability, inclusion, dignity, peace, and knowledge. Painterly realism, subdued colors, no people, no text."}
