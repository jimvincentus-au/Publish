# Week 48 Appendix: Memory As Instrument

*Law, force, and narrative tightened around the presidency, turning immigration, archives, and media into coordinated tools of control rather than constraint.*

![Header image](image_wide_week48_appendix.png)

This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The Trump administration simultaneously expanded hard power (Venezuela blockade, fentanyl-as-WMD order, travel-ban expansion) and soft control over information, memory, and the civil service. Immigration enforcement and Supreme Court doctrine moved decisively toward racialized, discretionary power, while DOJ and FBI tools were redirected against perceived ideological enemies (anti-ICE activists, former intelligence officials) and away from elite accountability (Epstein files noncompliance, selective grant distribution). Regulatory agencies were aggressively captured or repurposed: EPA weakened carcinogen protections, NCAR dismantling advanced, and billions in university research funding were frozen, even as Trump’s own media company pursued a fusion-energy merger under his regulatory umbrella. Symbolic politics—biased presidential plaques, renaming the Kennedy Center, a triumphal arch—were funded and staged alongside material attacks on healthcare, LGBTQ+ care, and immigrant rights. Congress showed pockets of resistance (ACA subsidy discharge petition, Epstein transparency pressure), and courts occasionally checked executive overreach on immigration bonds and university funding, but these were outweighed by structural moves that entrench executive impunity, politicize the bureaucracy, and normalize emergency-style national security framing for domestic policy.

Power and Authority

1. President Trump oversaw release of a new National Security Strategy reframing immigration and alliances (2025-12-13): The strategy elevated immigration and civilizational conflict as security threats and revived a hard-edged Monroe Doctrine, signaling a more unilateral, identity-driven use of U.S. power abroad.

2. Trump administration froze asylum decisions and halted immigration applications for Afghans and nationals of travel-ban countries (2025-12-13): The freeze abruptly cut off legal pathways for thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers, expanding executive control over who can access U.S. protection and status.

3. President Trump signed an executive order designating illicit fentanyl and its precursors as weapons of mass destruction (2025-12-15): Recasting fentanyl as a WMD allowed national-security and military tools to be deployed in domestic drug enforcement, blurring lines between policing and war powers.

4. President Trump expanded the travel ban to additional African and Middle Eastern countries and Palestinian document holders (2025-12-16): The broader ban further restricted mobility for targeted nationalities and deepened a tiered system of access to the U.S. based on origin and perceived security risk.

5. President Trump ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers and labeled the Maduro government a terrorist organization (2025-12-17): Designating a sovereign state as a terrorist entity and blockading its oil exports escalated U.S. coercive power, stretching terrorism frameworks and risking conflict without clear congressional authorization.

6. President Trump publicly floated the idea of serving a third presidential term and had aides praise it (2025-12-18): By entertaining a third term and amplifying legal arguments that the 22nd Amendment is unclear, the White House normalized discussion of breaching constitutional term limits.

7. President Trump announced a one-time $1,776 "warrior dividend" for service members funded from existing housing allowances (2025-12-18): Repurposing congressionally appropriated housing funds into a branded cash bonus used the military payroll as a political tool while undermining long-term housing support.

8. President Trump signed executive orders reclassifying marijuana and directing expanded cannabis research (2025-12-18): Rescheduling marijuana to facilitate research and easing access for medical uses shifted federal drug policy, modestly reducing criminalization and expanding executive influence over health regulation.

9. President Trump issued an executive order closing federal executive agencies on December 24 and 26, 2025 (2025-12-18): The closure order adjusted federal operations and pay around the holidays, illustrating presidential discretion over basic government service availability.

10. President Trump ordered government-wide adjustments to federal civilian and military pay rates for 2026 (2025-12-18): The pay order reset compensation structures across branches and services, affecting public-sector labor conditions and budget priorities.

11. President Trump issued an executive order setting an expansive national space superiority agenda (2025-12-18): The directive framed space exploration and defense as arenas for U.S. dominance, committing national resources and security policy to long-term strategic projects.

12. Trump administration moved to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research and cancel its grants (2025-12-18): Targeting a major climate research hub for closure weakened federal scientific capacity on weather and climate risks, reducing expert input into policy decisions.

13. Trump administration announced plans to dismantle NCAR and redirect activities citing ideological concerns (2025-12-17): Labeling core climate science work as "woke" and moving to shut it down signaled direct ideological control over which research the federal government supports.

14. Trump administration proposed seizing California land along the southern border for expanded military control (2025-12-19): The proposal to convert state land into federal military zones along the border would extend military authority into civilian areas and override state preferences.


Institutions and Governance

1. House Republican leadership advanced a healthcare plan that omitted extension of enhanced ACA tax credits (2025-12-13): By excluding extended marketplace subsidies, House leaders set up a lapse in support that would raise premiums for millions, using legislative design to reshape access to health coverage.

2. House Speaker Mike Johnson blocked and delayed floor votes on extending ACA premium subsidies despite majority support (2025-12-18): Using procedural control to prevent a vote on widely supported subsidies showed how leadership can thwart majority will on core welfare policy.

3. Bipartisan House coalition used a discharge petition to force a future vote on extending ACA subsidies (2025-12-17): Republicans joining Democrats to trigger a discharge petition demonstrated legislators using rare procedural tools to bypass leadership and secure a vote on health affordability.

5. U.S. Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 (2025-12-18): The NDAA set nearly $901 billion in defense policy and funding, including DEI rollbacks and new oversight demands on boat-strike footage, shaping civil-military relations and accountability.

6. House of Representatives passed a measure to restore federal employee union rights previously curtailed (2025-12-15): The vote sought to reverse an earlier executive rollback of collective bargaining in federal agencies, reasserting legislative support for organized labor in the civil service.

7. Senate Democrats announced they would block civilian nominations until briefed on Epstein files release (2025-12-16): Tying confirmation of nominees to compliance with a transparency law used Senate powers to pressure DOJ to release politically sensitive records.

8. House Oversight Democrats released additional photographs from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate ahead of a DOJ deadline (2025-12-18): Publishing new Epstein materials kept public and political pressure on DOJ to comply with statutory disclosure requirements about elite-linked crimes.

9. Department of Justice released only heavily redacted Epstein files despite a law requiring broad disclosure (2025-12-19): By slow-walking and heavily redacting Epstein records beyond what the statute allows, DOJ appeared to defy a transparency mandate concerning powerful figures’ misconduct.

10. U.S. District Court blocked the administration from withholding funding and imposing fines on the University of California (2025-12-15): The ruling curtailed use of civil-rights investigations as a pretext to coerce universities into ideological changes by threatening massive financial penalties.

12. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis and the Supreme Court ordered Kilmar Ábrego Garcia’s release and directed the government to facilitate his return (2025-12-15): The rulings enforced procedural protections in a contested deportation case, underscoring judicial oversight of immigration enforcement and executive compliance with prior orders.

13. National Trust for Historic Preservation and allied plaintiffs filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s demolition and expansion plans at historic federal buildings (2025-12-15): The suits argued that the president bypassed required review and public input to alter major federal properties, testing legal limits on unilateral changes to shared civic spaces.

14. Department of Justice defended Trump’s White House ballroom project in court on national security grounds (2025-12-17): Invoking security to justify bypassing preservation and public-process requirements blurred the line between legitimate protection needs and shielding presidential building projects from scrutiny.

15. Georgia State Senate special committee investigated District Attorney Fani Willis over her prosecution of Trump (2025-12-17): The inquiry into a local prosecutor handling a former president’s election case highlighted how partisan state bodies can pressure independent legal actors.

16. Congressional Democrats demanded full video and legal justification for U.S. boat strikes in the eastern Pacific (2025-12-17): Lawmakers criticized classified briefings that omitted unedited footage of strikes with civilian casualties, underscoring tensions over transparency and war powers.

17. Senator Andy Kim called for public hearings on Trump’s threatened military actions against Venezuela (2025-12-17): The demand for open hearings sought to subject potential foreign military escalation to democratic debate and congressional oversight.

18. Special Counsel Jack Smith testified to Congress about Trump’s criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election and sought public release of his deposition (2025-12-18): Smith’s evidence and push for transparency highlighted both the depth of alleged election subversion and congressional reluctance to air the findings publicly.

19. Department of Justice filed a court brief asserting it could lawfully direct federal grants only to Republican-led states (2025-12-18): Arguing that partisan allocation of federal funds is constitutional signaled a willingness to weaponize fiscal tools against disfavored jurisdictions.

Economic Structure

1. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation’s KPB Services signed and then moved to exit a major ICE detention facility design contract (2025-12-13): The $29.9 million contract illustrated how federal detention infrastructure is outsourced, while tribal backlash highlighted ethical and sovereignty concerns around profiting from immigration enforcement.
