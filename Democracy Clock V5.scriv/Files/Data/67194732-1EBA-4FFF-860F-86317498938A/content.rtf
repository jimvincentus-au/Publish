In Week 13 of Trump\'92s second term, a pattern that had been faint in earlier weeks came into sharp relief. The presidency was no longer merely stretching its reach; it was testing whether the other branches would, in practice, be able to stop it. Immigration, higher education, civil rights enforcement, and the information system itself became the main fields of contest. The week\'92s events showed a government willing to treat law as a tool rather than a boundary, and to use money, status, and fear to bring once\uc0\u8209 independent institutions to heel. Yet the same week also recorded judges, universities, and some state officials pushing back, insisting that orders be obeyed and rights respected. The struggle was not abstract. It played out in prisons in El Salvador, in classrooms in Maine and Virginia, in clinics in Alabama, and in the quiet offices of civil servants told they could now be fired at will. It felt close to home.\
\
At the start of Week 13, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:49 p.m. By the end of the period, it had moved to 7:50 p.m., a shift of 1.1 minutes toward midnight. The movement was modest in numerical terms, but it reflected a dense cluster of structural changes. Executive power widened again through new orders and memoranda that bypassed normal process. Law was used more openly as a weapon against critics and vulnerable groups, not as a limit on state action. Agencies were hollowed out or bent toward private and partisan aims. Transparency was cut back, and the civil service was made more precarious. At the same time, courts blocked some deportations, paused the gutting of the consumer watchdog, and insisted that a wrongfully deported man must be brought home. The clock moved because the balance between assertion and restraint shifted further toward assertion, even as resistance remained visible. Both trends mattered.\
\
The clearest test of the rule of law centered on one man, Kilmar \'c1brego Garc\'eda, a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador. The Supreme Court had already ruled, unanimously, that the government must facilitate his return and treat his case as if the deportation had never happened. Yet the administration told lower courts that it had no legal duty to bring him back, and that any attempt to do so would intrude on the president\'92s foreign affairs powers. In the Oval Office, President Trump met with El Salvador\'92s president, Nayib Bukele, and the two leaders agreed that Garc\'eda would not be returned, despite the Court\'92s order. Administration lawyers argued that once a person was in Salvadoran custody, U.S. courts had no jurisdiction. A federal judge in Maryland rebuked this stance, noting that \'93nothing has been done\'94 to comply, and opened a two\uc0\u8209 week fact\u8209 finding inquiry into possible contempt. The Fourth Circuit refused to block the district court\'92s order, warning that allowing the executive to detain residents in foreign prisons beyond judicial reach would endanger constitutional democracy itself. The law, on paper, held firm. In practice, the executive treated it as one voice among many.\
\
The same pattern appeared in the administration\'92s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador\'92s mega\uc0\u8209 prison. Judges in Nevada, California, and Colorado issued temporary orders blocking specific deportations and halting the broader program while lawsuits proceeded. One judge, James Boasberg, found probable cause to hold officials in criminal contempt for ignoring his injunction and failing to recall deportation flights. He warned that if the government did not \'93purge\'94 its contempt by returning those removed, he would consider appointing an independent prosecutor. The administration responded with an emergency motion arguing that contempt proceedings themselves were unconstitutional. Here again, courts asserted their authority, but enforcement depended on whether the executive would accept real consequences for defiance. The clock moved because the question was no longer whether judges would issue orders, but whether those orders would bite. That is a different kind of test.\
\
Immigration enforcement more broadly became a tool for punishing speech and identity. A Palestinian organizer and Columbia graduate, Mahmoud Khalil, was deemed deportable based on a State Department memo about his beliefs and associations, with no criminal allegations. A Turkish PhD student at Tufts, R\'fcmeysa \'d6zt\'fcrk, lost her visa and was detained in Louisiana after co\uc0\u8209 authoring an op\u8209 ed about Gaza; an immigration judge denied her bail as a supposed danger to the community. Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green\u8209 card holder and Columbia student, was arrested by ICE during his naturalization interview in Vermont, in what his lawyers called retaliation for pro\u8209 Palestinian advocacy. A Turkish student who criticized a university\'92s Gaza stance was deported despite no evidence of ties to terrorism. In each case, immigration law, designed to regulate entry and status, was used to target dissenting voices. The line between national security and political policing blurred. That line matters. When it moves, whole communities learn that speech can cost them their place.\
\
The administration also pushed the boundaries of who counts as deportable and where they can be sent. Merwil Guti\'e9rrez, a 19\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old Venezuelan with no gang ties, was swept up with hundreds of others and sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, to a prison in a country with which he had no connection. The government argued that once deportees were in Salvadoran custody, U.S. courts could not order their return. At the same time, President Trump proposed deporting \'93homegrown criminals,\'94 including U.S. citizens, to El Salvador for imprisonment, an idea legal experts described as plainly unconstitutional. The administration began vetting the social media of all visa applicants who had visited Gaza since 2007, singling out a political geography for special scrutiny. Together, these moves pointed toward an immigration and citizenship regime stratified by origin, ideology, and perceived loyalty, with foreign prisons used as an extension of U.S. power. The structure of belonging itself was being revised.\
\
Against this backdrop, courts did not simply stand aside. A federal judge in Boston blocked the administration\'92s attempt to cancel a parole program that gave legal status and work permits to more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Haiti. Judges in Colorado and elsewhere halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. Another judge barred a new policy that would have allowed rapid deportations to third countries without any chance to show fear of persecution, torture, or death. In Arizona and Florida, wrongfully detained U.S. citizens were released after judges dismissed cases or state authorities relented. These rulings did not reverse the structural changes in how immigration power was conceived, but they showed that the judiciary still functioned as a brake, even if it now had to fight for compliance. The brake worked, but under strain.\
\
While the courts wrestled with deportations, the administration turned its attention to universities and schools as ideological battlegrounds. Harvard University became the central target. After Harvard refused to accept a set of federal demands\'97ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, reshaping admissions and hiring, cracking down on pro\uc0\u8209 Palestinian protests, and cooperating more closely with immigration enforcement\'97the Department of Education froze roughly $2.3 billion in grants and a $60 million contract. The White House threatened to strip Harvard of its tax\u8209 exempt status, and the IRS was reported to be preparing such a move, despite expert warnings that presidential direction of tax enforcement would be illegal. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded records on foreign students allegedly involved in \'93dangerous or violent activity,\'94 threatening the university\'92s ability to host international students. Harvard\'92s leadership publicly rejected the demands, citing constitutional protections and academic freedom. The funding freeze remained in place. The message to other institutions was clear. Federal money, tax status, and visa programs could be used to force compliance with the administration\'92s cultural agenda.\
\
The pressure did not stop at Harvard. The Department of Energy faced a lawsuit from universities over a policy change that would cut research funding, and the NAACP sued the administration over anti\uc0\u8209 DEI policies in schools, arguing that they violated the Civil Rights Act. Twelve students in Pentagon\u8209 run schools, supported by the ACLU, sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over book bans that removed works on race, gender, and health from their libraries. At the U.S. Naval Academy, nearly 400 books about slavery, the civil rights movement, and the Holocaust were taken off shelves under a DEI ban, while Hitler\'92s \'93Mein Kampf\'94 remained. These actions, rooted in executive orders, did more than censor particular titles. They signaled a federal project to reshape what young people, especially those in military\u8209 linked institutions, are allowed to learn about the country\'92s past and present. When the state curates memory in this way, it narrows the space in which future citizens can judge their own government. That is the point.\
\
K\'9612 education became another front. In Maine, the administration sued to stop transgender girls from competing in girls\'92 sports, arguing that the state\'92s policy violated Title IX. President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to withhold $250 million in federal K\'9612 funding and freeze school lunch money unless Maine changed its law. A federal judge temporarily blocked the funding freeze after Maine countersued, but the threat remained. At the same time, the president signed an earlier executive order barring transgender participants from women\'92s sports nationwide, and visa restrictions were placed on transgender athletes entering the United States. These moves used federal spending and immigration tools to enforce a particular view of gender across states and borders. They also showed how civil rights enforcement could be inverted. The Department of Justice\'92s Civil Rights Division, under new leadership, issued mission statements that downplayed traditional protections for marginalized groups and emphasized voter fraud, \'93anti\uc0\u8209 white\'94 discrimination, and enforcement of Trump\'92s orders. The machinery stayed in place, but its purpose shifted.\
\
Voting itself came under new pressure. President Trump issued an executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, despite the lack of evidence that noncitizen voting is a significant problem. The U.S. House passed the Save Act, which would require such proof for voter registration and limit registration by mail or online. In North Carolina, courts invalidated hundreds of ballots in a close state supreme court race based on residency challenges brought by the losing candidate, Jefferson Griffin, including ballots from overseas and military voters. An appellate court sided with Griffin in a broader challenge that could force tens of thousands of voters to prove their eligibility after the fact, though the ruling was on hold pending state supreme court review. The state Board of Elections, responding to investigative reporting, moved to restore ballots that had been wrongly discarded and to verify residency through its own methods. Across these cases, the language of \'93election integrity\'94 was used to justify new barriers and retroactive challenges, while the actual instances of fraud remained vanishingly small. The effect was to make voting more burdensome for many, especially those with fewer documents or more mobile lives.\
\
Beyond law and education, the administration worked to reshape the machinery of government itself. A new category of federal workers\'97about 50,000 positions\'97was created as at\uc0\u8209 will employees who could be fired for \'93subversion of presidential directives.\'94 This change cut into long\u8209 standing civil service protections and made it easier to remove career officials who resisted political pressure. At the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies, roughly 50 senior staff, including FEMA\'92s acting administrator, were subjected to polygraph tests in leak investigations. Dan Caldwell, a top adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was escorted from the Pentagon and placed on leave over an alleged unauthorized disclosure. An immigration lawyer who had admitted in court that Garc\'eda\'92s deportation was a mistake was fired by the Justice Department. Together, these actions sent a message inside the bureaucracy: loyalty to the president\'92s line mattered more than adherence to process or candor before the courts. Whistleblowing and internal dissent carried real risk. That risk was the point.\
\
Administrative agencies were also steered toward private and partisan interests. A presidential memorandum allowed agencies to repeal regulations they deemed \'93obviously unlawful\'94 without public notice, weakening the notice\uc0\u8209 and\u8209 comment process that anchors modern rulemaking. Executive orders directed sweeping changes in procurement, office siting, and critical mineral policy, centralizing more discretion in the White House. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, tried to embed staff inside the Vera Institute of Justice, an independent nonprofit, even after canceling its federal funding, framing the move as compliance with an executive order. At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the administration moved to fire nearly 90 percent of staff after a court ruled the agency could be shrunk but not abolished. A federal judge, Amy Berman Jackson, blocked the layoffs, and another judge later paused them, but the attempt itself showed how far the executive was willing to go to disable a watchdog created by Congress. In the financial sector, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped or paused investigations into more than a dozen cryptocurrency firms while the Trump family expanded its stake in the industry through World Liberty Financial. Trump Media and Technology Group launched \'93Truth Social\u8209 branded\'94 investment accounts designed to profit from companies favored by the president\'92s tariffs and \'93America First\'94 policies. Policy and profit were no longer merely adjacent; they were intertwined.\
\
Information and memory were managed with equal care. The administration closed the State Department\'92s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office, known as R/FIMI, which had tracked foreign disinformation campaigns. Secretary of State Marco Rubio framed the closure as a move against domestic \'93censorship,\'94 but the effect was to remove a dedicated capacity to monitor and counter hostile influence operations. Climate and environmental justice webpages, including tools that mapped pollution and climate impacts, were taken down from federal sites, prompting lawsuits from environmental and consumer groups. Covid.gov, once a portal for tests, vaccines, and treatment information, was replaced with content focused on the \'93lab leak\'94 theory and attacks on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the World Health Organization, and state leaders. The White House website published an article accusing NPR and PBS of running a \'93grift\'94 of \'93radical, woke propaganda.\'94 The administration misrepresented the Supreme Court\'92s ruling in Garc\'eda\'92s case, claiming victory where it had been ordered to act. It then posted an edited image of a New York Times front page, removing the word \'93wrongly\'94 from a description of Garc\'eda\'92s deportation and adding the phrase \'93who is never coming back.\'94 These acts did not simply spin events; they altered the official record and signaled that the government would use its platforms to rewrite ongoing disputes in its favor.\
\
Independent media faced direct pressure. The Associated Press, having won a court order restoring its White House access after refusing to adopt the term \'93Gulf of America,\'94 found its reporter and photographer barred from an Oval Office event. The AP accused the administration of violating the injunction. President Trump called for CBS to lose its broadcasting license after \'9360 Minutes\'94 aired segments he disliked, and urged FCC Chair Brendan Carr to impose maximum fines. Carr, in turn, threatened Comcast, the parent of MSNBC and CNN, over coverage of the Garc\'eda story, suggesting that their reporting might violate the requirement that licensees serve the public interest. A Trump ally reportedly told CNN\'92s parent company that it could avoid lawsuits by producing favorable content, such as a documentary about Melania Trump. These moves used the tools of regulation and litigation as levers over coverage. They also reinforced a hierarchy in which state\uc0\u8209 aligned outlets thrived while critical ones faced legal and economic risk. The chill was intentional.\
\
Economic policy added another layer of instability. On what he called \'93liberation day,\'94 President Trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all imports, followed by steep \'93reciprocal\'94 tariffs on China and the European Union. Markets plunged; the Dow fell by more than 2,000 points, and global investors began selling U.S. bonds, driving up yields even as the dollar weakened. Within days, the administration paused most of the tariffs for 90 days, except for China, whose rate was raised to 125 or 145 percent, depending on the account. U.S. Customs quietly exempted smartphones and other electronics from the China tariffs, shielding a major import category without public explanation. The Commerce Department imposed a 21 percent tariff on Mexican tomatoes, risking higher food prices. China responded by cutting off exports of key rare earth minerals and halting Boeing deliveries. Economists warned of recession and inflation. The Federal Reserve, under Jerome Powell, refused to cut interest rates in response to political pressure, citing data and the need for independence. President Trump attacked Powell as \'93always TOO LATE AND WRONG\'94 and called for his firing, even though he lacked the legal authority to remove the chair without cause. The pattern was not one of steady industrial strategy but of abrupt moves and reversals that created chaos, then used that chaos to justify further concentration of decision\uc0\u8209 making in the executive.\
\
Federal power was also used selectively against states and localities. North Carolina\'92s request for extended FEMA aid after Hurricane Helene was denied, despite ongoing recovery needs. Maine was threatened with the loss of education and school lunch funding over its transgender sports policy. Title X family planning funds\'97about $66 million\'97were frozen for clinics serving more than two million people, many of them low\uc0\u8209 income women and minorities, under the guise of compliance reviews. The Department of Justice canceled an environmental justice settlement with Alabama that had required the state to stop criminally prosecuting poor residents for lacking proper sewage systems in Lowndes County, and to address the health risks of raw sewage exposure. These decisions did not simply reflect policy preferences. They showed federal resources being used as punishment for jurisdictions and communities that did not align with the administration\'92s priorities. Geography and policy stance now shaped access to basic support.\
\
Amid these shifts, civil society and some officials continued to act. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland wrote to El Salvador\'92s ambassador, then traveled to El Salvador to seek access to Garc\'eda and press for his return. Salvadoran authorities denied him a meeting with President Bukele and initially blocked access to Garc\'eda, but he eventually met the detainee and relayed his messages home. Congressman Gerald Connolly, the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, demanded that the Social Security Administration reverse its freeze of the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, arguing that it increased costs, reduced efficiency, and might violate federal law. Labor groups sued over the cancellation of international labor rights grants. Environmental organizations challenged the rollback of green policies and the removal of climate data. Students, universities, and civil rights groups went to court over visa revocations, book bans, and anti\uc0\u8209 DEI rules. These actions did not stop the week\'92s drift, but they kept open channels through which law and public pressure could still work. Those channels remain vital.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 13, several processes were already in motion. The Supreme Court set arguments for May on the president\'92s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, a case that would test the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal judges launched inquiries into the administration\'92s defiance of deportation orders and signaled possible criminal contempt. Lawsuits over Harvard\'92s funding freeze, Maine\'92s education funds, the CFPB layoffs, climate grants, and DEI bans were moving through the courts. The closure of the State Department\'92s disinformation office left a gap in the country\'92s defenses against foreign influence, with no clear replacement. Tariff disputes with China and lawsuits from California over trade authority promised further clashes over who controls economic policy. These were not speculative risks. They were scheduled hearings, pending motions, and open investigations that would shape the next stages of the struggle over power.\
\
By the close of Week 13, with the Democracy Clock at 7:50 p.m., the civic covenant described in the moral assessment had not shattered, but it had cracked further. Executive orders and memoranda were used to bypass process and concentrate authority. Law was bent to serve the state\'92s immediate aims, especially in immigration and civil rights. Agencies meant to serve the public were hollowed out or steered toward private and partisan ends. Transparency tools were removed, archives were sealed or altered, and the information space was flooded with state\uc0\u8209 driven narratives. Universities, schools, and media organizations were told that their funding, tax status, and access depended on their willingness to align with the administration\'92s agenda. Yet courts still issued orders, some states still resisted, and parts of civil society still organized and sued. The week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows both how far the executive is prepared to go, and how much strain the remaining guardrails can bear. The time is not yet late enough that reversal is impossible. But with each small movement of the clock, the cost of repair grows, and the habit of defiance becomes more normal. The official time at the end of Week 13 is 7:50 p.m. The distance to midnight is shorter, and the work of holding the line is harder than it was a week before.\
