\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 3 of Trump\'92s second term made the fusion of private capital and public authority unmistakable. Elon Musk\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 burrowed into Treasury, OPM, USAID, Education, NOAA, CMS, SBA, and Energy, gaining access to payment rails and personnel files while career officials and inspectors general were purged. The Justice Department and FBI were reengineered under Attorney General Pam Bondi into shields for the president and weapons against investigators, as foreign bribery and influence units were dismantled. Patronage appointments and Trump family ventures blurred governance with enrichment, while federal power was wielded against disfavored states, immigrants, and transgender Americans. Abroad, Gaza \'93takeover\'94 rhetoric, aid freezes, tariffs, and sanctions on the ICC signaled a foreign policy unmoored from law. Information systems and archives were quietly altered to shape memory. Courts, unions, state governments, and protesters mounted real but partial resistance. The Democracy Clock moved from 7:39 to 7:40 p.m., registering a modest numerical shift that masked a dense, coordinated tightening of control.\
