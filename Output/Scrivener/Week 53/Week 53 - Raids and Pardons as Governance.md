Week 53: Raids and Pardons as Governance
A week of warrantless raids, emergency decrees, and pay-to-play clemency showed how federal power now rewards loyalty and punishes defiance.
The fifty-third week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single order or speech. It unfolded as a series of linked decisions that made clear who counted, who did not, and what the state was now for. Immigration raids, emergency decrees, crypto deregulation, and doctored images might have seemed like separate stories. Placed side by side, they described a government that had grown more comfortable using every lever—legal, economic, informational—to reward loyalty, punish defiance, and redraw the boundaries of belonging.
At the close of the prior period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:12 p.m. It ended this week at the same public time, with an internal movement of 0.4 minutes. The face did not change, but the mechanism did. The small shift captured how much could move beneath the surface in seven days: inspectors general dismissed, emergency powers stretched, immigration turned into a tool of political discipline, and law bent toward friends and against critics. The week did not bring a visible lurch toward midnight. It deepened the grooves along which power now ran.
Minnesota was the clearest case. Federal authorities chose it as the place to show what resistance to Trump’s immigration agenda would cost. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security opened and expanded criminal investigations and subpoenas against Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom had opposed aggressive ICE tactics. At the same time, roughly 3,000 federal immigration agents were deployed into the state, an extraordinary surge that turned neighborhoods into enforcement zones and made daily life feel contingent for anyone who might be swept into the dragnet.
On the ground, the raids blurred the line between immigration enforcement and collective punishment. ICE agents operated under an internal memo that treated administrative removal orders as sufficient authority to enter homes without judicial warrants. Families woke to officers at their doors. In one case, agents forcibly detained a U.S. citizen, ChongLy “Scott” Thao, during a raid, despite the absence of a warrant. In another, they detained five-year-old Liam Ramos and other school-age children near schools, using children as leverage in operations that reached into classrooms and bus stops. The message was stark. No space—home, school, street—was beyond the reach of federal power.
The cost of that posture showed up in the bodies of people held in custody. At Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility, multiple detainees died in a short span, including a homicide and deaths ruled suicide. In Minneapolis, ICE officers shot and killed Renee Good under disputed circumstances. The Department of Justice declined to open a civil-rights investigation into her death, even as internal prosecutors resigned in protest. The refusal to examine lethal force by federal officers, set against the zeal with which DOJ pursued protesters and local officials, made clear that accountability would not run up the chain.
Minnesota officials and courts tried to draw lines. Governor Walz mobilized the state National Guard not to suppress demonstrations but to protect peaceful protesters and maintain order in the streets. A federal district court issued injunctions restricting DHS and ICE from using pepper spray and retaliating against demonstrators in Minneapolis, affirming that protest rights still carried legal weight. Yet those checks proved fragile. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals quickly stayed the lower court’s limits, restoring broader discretion to federal agents. In Washington, a district court allowed DHS to require a week’s notice before lawmakers could inspect detention facilities, weakening real-time congressional oversight of the very sites where abuses were alleged.
The model did not stop at Minnesota’s borders. In Maine, DHS and ICE launched Operation Catch of the Day, a targeted crackdown on Somali communities that combined arrests with limited public information. The pattern—concentrated enforcement against a racialized group, thin transparency, and broad discretion—echoed what Minnesotans were seeing. Vice President J.D. Vance publicly defended ICE’s conduct in Minnesota, signaling that the most controversial tactics had the backing of the highest levels of the administration. What might once have been treated as an overreach to be corrected was instead held up as a template.
While Minnesota absorbed the shock of mass raids, the administration rewrote the rules of immigration and foreign policy through emergency declarations. On January 20, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, using it to justify a massive expansion of deportations and military involvement. Emergency authority, once reserved for acute crises, became the default frame for managing migration. The same week, he threatened to cut off all federal payments to sanctuary cities, wielding fiscal power to coerce local governments into alignment on immigration policy.
Status itself became contingent. The Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans, a diaspora that had built lives in the United States under a program meant to shield them from instability at home. In parallel, the administration announced plans to deport at least 40 Iranian nationals, including LGBTQ+ individuals, to a regime known for persecuting dissidents and sexual minorities. These moves, combined with the Minnesota and Maine crackdowns, made clear that nationality, religion, and identity now shaped not only how people were treated but whether their safety counted in policy decisions.
Emergency logic extended beyond the border. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping import tariffs, centralizing trade policy in the executive and bypassing ordinary legislative debate. He tied new tariffs of 10 to 25 percent on imports from countries that resisted his Greenland ambitions, using economic pain as leverage for a personal geopolitical project. At the same time, he ordered military strikes in multiple countries, including Venezuela and Iran, and directed the capture and rendition of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Congress had a chance to assert its war powers by barring troop deployments to Venezuela. The House rejected that resolution and, in a separate vote, passed a Department of Homeland Security funding bill that maintained ICE’s budget. The legislature thus left the president’s emergency posture largely intact, even as it added modest oversight tools like body cameras.
The same Justice Department that declined to probe ICE killings and detention deaths moved aggressively against critics and dissenters. Trump ordered DOJ to investigate named political opponents and former officials, turning prosecutorial power into a direct instrument of personal retribution. He publicly threatened to prosecute Justice Department officials over their refusal to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, signaling that lawful resistance inside the state could carry criminal consequences. In the civil realm, he expanded defamation litigation against the New York Times over unfavorable polling, using the courts to pressure a major newspaper.
On the streets and in churches, dissenters felt that shift. DOJ filed criminal complaints against protesters who disrupted a Minnesota church service led by a pastor who also served as an ICE field director, blurring the line between religious authority and state enforcement. Prosecutors attempted to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon for his role in the same protest, but a magistrate judge blocked the effort. The attempt itself showed how far the department was willing to go in criminalizing protest and press activity linked to criticism of immigration policy. Meanwhile, the refusal to investigate Renee Good’s killing, despite internal resignations, underscored that the same tools would not be used to scrutinize violence by federal officers.
Inside DOJ and related agencies, personnel and priorities were reshaped to match this new posture. The administration dismissed numerous career Justice Department lawyers, many associated with prior Trump investigations, weakening institutional memory and signaling that professional independence carried risk. Enforcement resources were diverted away from white-collar crime toward immigration. ICE and the Department of Veterans Affairs halted processing of detainee medical claims, leaving outside providers unpaid and detainees’ access to care precarious. The pattern was consistent. Legal and administrative muscle pressed downward on protesters, immigrants, and critics, while elite actors and favored institutions saw deadlines slip and scrutiny soften.
Civil society did not accept this quietly. In the days leading up to and including January 20, activists, unions, and civic groups organized a series of coordinated actions that turned dissent into economic disruption. Women’s March and allied organizations called for a national walkout, urging people to withdraw their labor and participation in protest of what they described as authoritarian policies. The 50501 Movement organized the Free America Walkout, a synchronized action across all 50 states that combined work stoppages with rallies and marches, showing a capacity for nonviolent mass action that reached far beyond any single city.
Minnesota again became a focal point, this time for resistance. Community organizations and labor unions staged the Day of Truth & Freedom, a statewide economic blackout and general strike aimed at ICE operations. Businesses closed, workers stayed home, and streets filled with demonstrators demanding accountability for raids, deaths in detention, and the killing of Renee Good. The strike model spread, with nurses and other workers in multiple states joining a broader labor and pro-democracy strike that linked workplace safety, health policy, and democratic norms. In North Carolina, civil-rights and faith groups organized trainings and marches focused on racial justice and voting rights, building capacity to contest racial gerrymandering and to stand in solidarity with the Twin Cities.
Subnational institutions offered their own counterpoints. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger was sworn in as the state’s first female governor in a ceremony that explicitly praised the peaceful transfer of power. The contrast with the national climate was stark. Where the federal executive framed opposition as insurrection, a state executive highlighted continuity and legitimacy. In Minnesota, Walz’s use of the National Guard to protect, rather than suppress, protest showed that the same tools could be wielded in defense of rights rather than against them. These choices did not reverse federal policy, but they showed that not all centers of power had accepted the new terms.
The administration’s rhetoric worked to close that gap. Trump publicly labeled Minnesota protesters as agitators and insurrectionists, suggesting that they should be jailed or even deported. He cast state and local officials who resisted ICE tactics as corrupt, folding them into a broader narrative of enemies within. This language did more than vent anger. It laid the groundwork for treating political opposition as a security threat, a frame that could justify both legal charges and economic punishment.
Those words were paired with concrete threats. The promise to cut off all federal payments to sanctuary cities turned fiscal policy into a weapon against jurisdictions that chose a different approach to immigration. The threat to prosecute DOJ officials who had refused to help overturn the 2020 election extended that logic into the bureaucracy, warning that internal dissent could be recast as criminal conduct. Within his own party, Trump backed Representative Julia Letlow’s primary challenge against Senator Bill Cassidy, who had voted to convict him in his second impeachment trial. Intra-party contests became a tool to discipline legislators who had once broken with him, reinforcing the message that loyalty was not optional.
Control over information and memory moved in step with these legal and rhetorical shifts. The White House press secretary threatened legal action if CBS edited a Trump interview, insisting it air uncut. The president signed an executive order framed as ending government censorship, but used it to freeze funds and target disfavored law firms and universities seen as hostile. The language of free speech was turned inside out, serving as cover for selective punishment of critical institutions rather than protection of open debate.
Behind the scenes, data systems were repurposed to support a narrative of voter fraud. Staff at the Department of Government Efficiency improperly accessed and shared Social Security data with a political group to search for alleged noncitizen voting. They sought voter files to cross-check names, blurring the line between administrative records and partisan projects. A senior staffer, Antonio Gracias, publicly claimed that millions of noncitizens were registered to vote based on these misinterpreted datasets, even though no prosecutions followed. The misuse of government data and the amplification of false claims fed a climate of distrust around elections and justified calls for restrictive voting measures.
Visual manipulation added another layer. White House communications staff posted AI-altered images of arrested activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, first depicting her as hysterical, then with darkened skin and tears. These images circulated as if they were authentic, shaping public perception of a protester whose real actions and demeanor might have told a different story. At the same time, Trump revived long-debunked conspiracy theories about 2020 election fraud and foreign interference, and dismissed unfavorable polling on Greenland and other issues as fake or fraudulent. The combined effect was to erode trust in independent measurement—whether of public opinion, election outcomes, or on-the-ground events.
The manipulation extended into diplomacy and history. Trump published a private message from French President Emmanuel Macron about a proposed G7 meeting and later leaked other world leaders’ text messages on social media. These breaches of confidentiality made it harder for foreign counterparts to trust that candid exchanges would remain private, weakening the informal channels that often sustain alliances. At home, the National Park Service dismantled a slavery-related exhibit at Philadelphia’s President’s House site, removing a display that had told the story of George Washington’s enslaved workers. The City of Philadelphia sued the federal government over the removal, seeking judicial review of how national history was being edited. The same week, the administration pressured NIH, CDC, and foreign-aid programs to align scientific and health messaging with ideological positions on DEI, gender, and harm reduction, narrowing the space for evidence-based guidance.
Civil rights and public health protections were reshaped in ways that reinforced these hierarchies. Trump signed executive orders rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in federal funding, passports, and public information, narrowing who could count on recognition and equal treatment from the state. He banned what he called “gender ideology” and DEI programs in federal institutions and schools, and issued another order restricting DEI efforts among grant recipients. Hospitals, facing federal pressure and legal risk, halted gender-affirming care for minors, effectively cutting off access to medically endorsed treatment for a vulnerable group.
Abroad, the administration expanded the Mexico City policy to bar foreign-aid recipients from funding DEI and trans-rights work, exporting domestic culture-war priorities into global civil society. At home, health coverage itself was pared back. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage for millions, threatening the viability of rural and low-income hospitals. The administration allowed ACA subsidies to lapse, undermining access to insurance for tens of millions. The CDC reversed its recommendation of Covid vaccines for pregnant women, against expert advice, and moved to block overdose programs from using “never use alone” harm-reduction messaging. NIH ended funding for research using fetal tissue from elective abortions. Together, these moves narrowed who could rely on the state for health security and whose lives were treated as expendable in service of ideological goals.
Economic policy and regulation followed a similar pattern of favoring aligned wealth. On January 23, Trump signed the Genius Act, establishing a light regulatory framework for stablecoins that industry lobbyists had helped shape. He paired it with an executive order easing SEC oversight of the cryptocurrency sector. Both measures aligned closely with the interests of World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked firm, and other large crypto players. Regulatory agencies that were meant to stand at arm’s length from markets were instead used to clear paths for favored firms.
The most vivid example came in the form of clemency. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, convicted of anti–money laundering violations, received a presidential pardon after his company made a multibillion-dollar investment in a Trump family financial venture. The sequence—investment, conviction, pardon—reinforced the perception that legal outcomes could be purchased by well-connected capital. At the same time, financial enforcement resources were being pulled away from complex fraud and toward immigration, as lawmakers demanded an investigation into the diversion of 25,000 agents from white-collar crime to border work. The law bore down on the poor and the undocumented while lifting from the shoulders of the rich.
Other economic choices fit the same mold. Protectionist tariffs, justified as tools to revive U.S. manufacturing, coincided with job losses in most sectors, showing how top-down experiments imposed diffuse costs on workers. Emergency tariffs under IEEPA and Greenland-linked threats rattled markets enough that bond yields, equities, and currencies pushed back, forcing the administration to retreat from some of its most aggressive plans. Even here, the constraint came not from Congress or courts but from financial markets worried about instability. In Washington, Trump fired all members of the Commission on Fine Arts and replaced them with loyalists to advance his White House ballroom project, turning an oversight body meant to provide independent judgment on public works into another instrument of patronage.
Amid this consolidation, some institutions still pushed back. Federal courts issued injunctions temporarily blocking HUD’s overhaul of homelessness funding rules, recognizing that abrupt changes could displace vulnerable residents. District judges in Minnesota initially limited ICE’s use of force and retaliation against protesters, even if appellate courts later narrowed those protections. In New York, a state supreme court justice ordered the redrawing of a congressional district that diluted Black and Latino voting power, enforcing state constitutional protections for minority representation.
At the national level, the Supreme Court heard arguments on West Virginia’s restrictions on transgender students in school sports, Hawaii’s limits on firearms on public-facing private property, and Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. These cases probed how far equal protection, gun rights, and monetary independence would bend under current doctrine. In the lower courts, judges forced the resignation of an unlawfully appointed U.S. attorney, showing that some appointment boundaries still held. Yet the same week, Trump called for the impeachment of Chief Judge James Boasberg after he blocked deportations to a Salvadoran prison, escalating political attacks on judicial independence.
Congress, too, showed a mixed record. It passed three veterans-focused laws on housing support, services, and budget accountability, showing that bipartisan cooperation on discrete issues remained possible. The House Judiciary Committee held public testimony with former Special Counsel Jack Smith, using hearing powers to surface information about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But the House also rejected a resolution to limit troop deployments to Venezuela and funded DHS and ICE without imposing meaningful new constraints on their core operations. Oversight came in flashes—hearings, letters, public condemnations—while appropriations and war powers often moved in the president’s favor.
Regulatory agencies carried on with more technocratic work that, in another era, might have defined a normal week. The FCC advanced multilingual Wireless Emergency Alerts and sought comment on FOIA and Privacy Act processes. The Census Bureau updated a major business survey. The EPA approved Ohio’s ozone control plan and advanced hazardous-waste and Superfund decisions. The FDA issued guidances on pediatric drugs, clinical endpoints, device testing, and cosmetic records. These actions refined the machinery of governance in ways that supported transparency, safety, and data quality. Yet even here, the General Services Administration’s decision to remove its own conduct rules for federal property and defer to DHS regulations showed how authority over public space was being centralized in a security-focused department.
No single scheduled event loomed over the week in the way an election or a major court ruling might. Instead, the calendar was crowded with hearings, strikes, executive orders, and regulatory notices that, taken together, mapped the new terrain. The next steps were already embedded in the actions themselves: emergency powers that did not expire, deregulation that would be hard to reverse, appointments that would outlast headlines, and lawsuits that would take months or years to resolve.
In the arc of Trump’s second term, this week marked not a sudden break but an acute consolidation. Federal power was used to make examples of disfavored states and communities, to strip protections from selected groups, and to tilt law and regulation toward aligned wealth. Civil society responded with walkouts and strikes that showed notable capacity for coordinated resistance, yet these efforts ran up against a state increasingly willing to treat dissent as disorder and opposition as corruption. Institutions pushed back in places—courtrooms, city halls, regulatory dockets—but their resistance was uneven and often outpaced. The Democracy Clock barely moved on its face, yet the cost of using rights, telling the truth, or standing apart from the regime rose in ways that would shape every week that followed.
