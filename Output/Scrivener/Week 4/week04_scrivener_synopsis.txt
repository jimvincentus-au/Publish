In Week 4 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock moved from 7:46 p.m. to 7:50 p.m., a 4.2‑minute shift that marked acceleration rather than rupture. The centerpiece was the rise of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from concept to operating system: executive orders repurposed the U.S. Digital Service into a Musk‑run unit with authority over hiring, firing, payments, and data across the state. Mass layoffs, buyouts, and probationary purges hollowed agencies from Energy and Veterans Affairs to Education, USAID, and the CFPB, while science and social programs were frozen or starved. Law enforcement and oversight were bent toward regime needs, from the quashed Eric Adams corruption case and paused FCPA enforcement to the firing of ethics officials and dismantling of foreign‑influence task forces. Simultaneously, the administration scrubbed DEI and LGBTQ content, rewrote Stonewall’s history, punished the Associated Press, and floated annexationist plans for Gaza. Courts, inspectors general, state officials, and civil society won important injunctions and restorations, but their victories were reactive and partial against a consolidating parallel executive state.
