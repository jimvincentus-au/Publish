Additionally, the defense department has instructed these academies to remove books and materials that may conflict with the DEI-related policy. This move has sparked protests and at least one faculty resignation at West Point.",

NPR, joined by three Colorado public radio stations, seeks to have the order permanently blocked and declared unconstitutional. The executive order instructs federal agencies to cease funding NPR and PBS, claiming they promote partisanship and left-wing propaganda.",

This stabilization is attributed to the Affordable Care Act's cost control measures, which reportedly reduced health care spending by $2.3 trillion from 2010 to 2017. The Act's provisions have led to lower premiums for Americans with private employer-sponsored insurance, averaging nearly $1,000 less per person. This development marks a significant shift from the previous trend of rapidly increasing health care costs.",
