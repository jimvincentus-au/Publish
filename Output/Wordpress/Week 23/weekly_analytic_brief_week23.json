    "Executive branch: War powers and emergency authorities are exercised expansively abroad and at home, with the White House openly managing intelligence narratives and sidelining its own DNI to maintain a preferred story.",
    "Judiciary: The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority significantly reduces lower courts\u2019 ability to block executive orders and narrows rights of Medicaid patients and migrants, while controversial nominees with records of defying courts advance.",
    "Congress: Oversight is weakened by internal division and executive stonewalling; impeachment efforts over unauthorized war are tabled, and even critical War Powers resolutions struggle to gain traction in a GOP-controlled legislature.",
    "Civil service and agencies: ICE, DHS, and DOJ are increasingly politicized and partially outsourced, while Voice of America and public health bodies are purged or repurposed, shifting the bureaucracy toward loyalty and enforcement over expertise.",
    "Media and information sphere: Independent and watchdog media face defamation suits, firing demands, funding threats, and mass layoffs, while state-aligned narratives on Iran and immigration are aggressively defended by senior officials."

    "The administration simultaneously escalates militarily against Iran and pursues secret sanctions-relief talks, raising questions about whether chaos and mixed signals are deliberate tools to manage domestic politics rather than coherent foreign policy.",
    "RFK Jr.\u2019s consolidation of power over vaccine and preventive health bodies, combined with Supreme Court rulings affirming his authority, creates a structurally novel situation where anti-science actors control science-based mandates; long-term public health impacts are uncertain.",
    "The assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman by a faux police officer sits at the intersection of political violence and impersonation of state authority; it is unclear how aggressively federal and state institutions will treat this as a systemic democratic threat rather than an isolated crime."

  "summary": "This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran, framed with manipulated intelligence and followed by efforts to restrict congressional access to classified assessments. That campaign, combined with domestic troop deployments against immigration protesters, normalizes emergency-style executive power and blurs civil\u2013military boundaries. Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is weaponized at scale: masked raids, record detentions, deaths and medical neglect in custody, expansion of private detention, and plans for massive new camps like \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d collectively signal a system where law is a tool of fear rather than a limit on state power. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions narrowing nationwide injunctions and limiting Medicaid patients\u2019 ability to sue, together with a hard-right immigration docket, structurally weaken judicial checks just as the executive and DOJ test open defiance of court orders. Information and knowledge systems are also targeted: mass firings at Voice of America, threats and investigations against journalists, politicization of vaccine and health science bodies, and pressure on universities and DEI infrastructure. Against this, there are pockets of resistance\u2014federal judges rebuking ICE and DOJ abuses, state and civil society lawsuits, and a high-profile progressive electoral win in New York\u2014but they operate in an environment of accelerating authoritarian drift.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Unilateral war-making and secrecy: Iran strikes launched without authorization, intelligence contradicted or sidelined, and subsequent moves to cancel briefings and restrict congressional access entrench an executive-first national security model.",
    "Militarized immigration state: Masked raids, record detentions, deaths and medical neglect, new mega-camps, and retaliation against local officials and families transform immigration enforcement into a broad instrument of social control.",
    "Judicial power narrowed as DOJ radicalizes: Supreme Court curbs nationwide injunctions and access to courts while DOJ officials contemplate ignoring orders, dropping corruption cases for political gain, and suing judges over immigration rulings.",
    "Capture and degradation of knowledge institutions: Vaccine and health panels purged and repopulated with skeptics, public health budgets slashed, universities and pro-democracy programs targeted, and public broadcasters gutted or threatened.",
    "Targeting of minorities and dissenters: Immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ+ students, and political opponents face denaturalization threats, selective deportation, curriculum carve-outs, and even assassination, reinforcing a stratified, fear-based polity."
