      "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a coordinated information struggle around legitimacy and accountability. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fall on civil service independence, regulatory integrity, immigration enforcement, and the information ecosystem. Mass firings and restructurings at State, EPA, USDA, DOJ, and ICE, combined with Supreme Court stays and RIF approvals, deepen capture of the bureaucracy (traits 1, 16, 22). Immigration policy becomes a central vector of authoritarian drift: expanded detention infrastructure, National Guard deployments, masked raids, Medicaid data-sharing, and courthouse arrests normalize rights-violating enforcement against non\u2011citizens (traits 4, 9, 11, 46, 47). Parallel moves weaponize the justice system against political enemies (Obama, Schiff) while rolling back police-reform consent decrees and birthright citizenship, even as some courts push back (traits 4, 14, 51). On the information front, the White House seizes control of the press pool, bans the Wall Street Journal, leverages mergers, and floods discourse with AI fakes and treason accusations, while selectively releasing MLK and Clinton files to distract from Epstein records (traits 42\u201343, 52\u201353, 58\u201360). A few countervailing judicial and legislative actions appear, but they are outweighed by systemic entrenchment.",
      "top_themes": [
        "Immigration enforcement as a laboratory for authoritarian methods: masked raids, data-mining of Medicaid, tent megacamps, National Guard deployments, and state\u2013federal deputization normalize exceptional powers against a politically weak population.",
        "Coordinated politicization of justice and intelligence: DOJ \u2018strike forces\u2019 on Obama, treason rhetoric, firings of Jan. 6 prosecutors, and anti\u2011DEI legal offensives repurpose law enforcement to punish enemies and dismantle civil-rights enforcement.",
        "Executive-driven economic and regulatory capture: crypto-friendly laws, conflicted appointees, AI deregulation, environmental rollbacks, and targeted rescissions shift policy-making toward donors and industries, sidelining public health and climate.",
        "Information control through retaliation and curated transparency: lawsuits and bans targeting disfavored outlets, AI propaganda, selective document dumps, and altered human-rights reporting reshape what the public can see and trust.",
        "Civil liberties squeezed at the margins: homelessness orders, anti\u2011trans sports bans, campus speech settlements, and mass student discipline expand the state\u2019s willingness to trade rights for \u2018order\u2019 and ideological conformity."
