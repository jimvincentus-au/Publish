\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Proposed Brief Statement of Purpose
\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 \
\
\'93We are here because reports of military killings in the Caribbean have raised profound moral, legal, and democratic concerns. As civilians, we have both the responsibility and the right to understand what has happened, to separate confirmed facts from speculation, and to determine what constructive, lawful actions we can take in response. Our purpose today is not to assign blame prematurely, but to gather reliable information, consider how civilian voices can contribute to transparency and accountability, and support efforts that protect human life and uphold the rule of law. This meeting is about clarity, responsibility, and the courage to act within democratic principles.\'94}
