  "summary": "This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with simultaneous blows to institutional checks, civil rights, and the information environment. The most acute pressures came from the normalization of emergency economic powers and sweeping tariffs, used to bypass Congress and rewire trade policy in ways that reward donors and punish disfavored regions. Parallel mass layoffs and politicization at HHS, EPA, USAID, and across the civil service hollowed out core state capacity, especially in public health and environmental protection. Federal power was overtly weaponized against universities, blue jurisdictions, and even a single state (Maine), while immigration tools were repurposed to target activists and vulnerable migrants using arbitrary criteria. Courts were a mixed arena: some federal judges and state AG coalitions checked deportations and election overreach, but other courts and the Supreme Court advanced partisan or anti-DEI outcomes and tolerated executive funding freezes. Media and academic freedom came under coordinated pressure via FCC investigations, access bans, Smithsonian interference, and funding threats to Columbia and Harvard. Against this backdrop, large-scale protests, Cory Booker\u2019s marathon speech, and electoral pushback in Wisconsin signaled significant, but still outmatched, democratic resistance.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Emergency economics as power grab: sweeping tariffs and a national emergency declaration reassign trade and tax-like powers to the executive, with Congress slow or unable to claw them back.",
    "Systematic hollowing of the state: mass layoffs, agency closures, and DOGE-driven restructuring degrade public health, environmental, and foreign aid capacity while embedding loyalists and contractors.",
    "Weaponized federal leverage: funding, immigration, and regulatory tools are used to discipline universities, blue cities, and a defiant state, turning federalism and civil rights enforcement into partisan instruments.",
    "Targeted repression through immigration and security: opaque deportations, subjective \u2018gang\u2019 criteria, device searches, and DHS civil rights rollbacks convert border and asylum systems into tools against dissenters and minorities.",
    "Contested but pressured rule of law: aggressive executive interference with law firms, judges, and grants coexists with notable judicial pushback on deportations, TPS, and election rules, producing a volatile legal landscape."
