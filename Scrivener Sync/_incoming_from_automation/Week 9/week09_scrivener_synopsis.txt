Week 9 of Trump’s second term crystallizes a method of rule: move fast on many fronts, stretch every legal tool to its edge, and treat resistance as disloyalty. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to Salvadoran prisons, defied Judge James Boasberg’s orders, and then tried to impeach him. Immigration enforcement blurred into political reprisal, while temporary protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants were revoked and bureaucratic friction weaponized at Social Security. Trump signed orders to dismantle the Department of Education and shutter the U.S. Agency for Global Media, even as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency tried to mine Social Security data and dismantle USAID and cultural institutions. Courts and civil society pushed back—blocking data grabs, restoring some aid, halting deportations, and challenging the education shutdown. The Democracy Clock stayed at 9:45 p.m.: not because danger receded, but because escalating executive defiance met equally visible, if fragile, institutional resistance.
