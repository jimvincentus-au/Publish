\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 6 marks a structural turn in the Trump\'96Musk project. Through the Department of Government Efficiency, an executive order routed nearly all federal payments through a new, lightly accountable node, freezing government credit cards and stalling research and routine operations. Parallel directives from OMB and OPM ordered mass layoff and reorganization plans across agencies, threatening to hollow out the neutral civil service at Social Security, Education, NOAA, EPA, USAID, and the Pentagon. Law enforcement and the military were openly politicized: Kash Patel took over the FBI, senior generals and JAGs were purged, and immigration and protest tools were aimed at migrants, transgender people, and critics while crypto donors and Trump\'92s own coin enjoyed regulatory indulgence. The White House seized control of the press pool, punished the Associated Press, and elevated partisan influencers as gatekeepers of scandal narratives. Courts, unions, governors, and protesters mounted real but defensive resistance. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:43 to 7:44 p.m., capturing a modest numerical shift that masks a deepening redesign of state power around personal rule and private gain.\
