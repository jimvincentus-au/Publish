# Week 7 Appendix: Tools As Habit, Not Exception

*Executive orders, mass layoffs, and curated information flows turned once‑extraordinary tools into routine methods for rewarding allies, disciplining dissent, and thinning the state.*

![Header image](image_wide_week7_appendix.png)

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and deepening fusion of crony capitalism with state policy. Trump’s team used executive orders and agency directives to reshape foreign policy toward Russia, hollow out regulatory and social-welfare capacity, and advance ideologically driven attacks on immigrants, LGBTQ people, racial equity, and universities. Mass layoffs and buyouts across Education, Social Security, VA, IRS, USDA, State, and USPS, combined with the effective shutdown of CFPB and restructuring of USAID and IAF, exert major structural pressure on traits 1, 16, 22, and 38. Simultaneously, the creation of a crypto reserve and non-enforcement of anti–money laundering rules entrench elite self-dealing and financial opacity. On the rule-of-law side, courts repeatedly checked executive overreach on foreign aid, firings, workforce cuts, and research funding, modestly strengthening separation-of-powers traits even as the administration retaliated against judges and prosecutors. Internationally, the U.S. moved further away from its democratic allies toward Russia, while pausing or weaponizing aid to Ukraine and South Africa. Civil society mobilization and some state-level protections for LGBTQ rights persisted, but were outweighed by systemic authoritarian drift.

Power and Authority

1. President Trump and the General Services Administration ordered closure of the 18F office and layoffs of its staff (2025-03-01): Shuttering 18F, which built tools like IRS Direct File, reduced in‑house federal digital capacity and advanced broader workforce cuts that weaken the state’s ability to deliver and modernize public services.

2. President Trump issued an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States (2025-03-01): Making English the official federal language and revoking prior language‑access rules narrowed access to government services for non‑English speakers, entrenching unequal participation in public life.

3. President Trump ordered investigations and tariff options on timber and lumber imports (2025-03-01): Directing a national‑security investigation into timber and lumber imports positioned trade tools for potential protectionist use, expanding executive leverage over key resource markets.

4. President Trump ordered immediate expansion of American timber production on federal lands (2025-03-01): Mandating rapid increases in logging and expedited approvals on federal lands used executive power to override environmental safeguards, shifting policy toward extractive interests with limited oversight.

5. Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency authorities to send $4 billion in arms to Israel without normal congressional review (2025-03-01): Bypassing Congress on a large arms transfer concentrated war‑making discretion in the executive branch and weakened legislative checks on foreign military commitments.

6. President Trump approved a nearly $3 billion arms sale to Israel while bypassing congressional review (2025-03-02): Authorizing major weapons sales without standard congressional oversight expanded unilateral executive control over foreign conflicts and reduced democratic accountability for their humanitarian impact.

7. President Trump issued executive orders tightening tariff rules at the northern and southern borders to address illicit drugs (2025-03-02): Adjusting de minimis tariff treatment at both borders under prior emergency‑style authorities further normalized using trade tools as unilateral security instruments with limited legislative input.

8. President Trump announced and then formalized creation of a federal strategic cryptocurrency reserve (2025-03-04): Ordering a strategic crypto reserve and digital asset stockpile gave the presidency direct control over large speculative holdings, raising conflict‑of‑interest risks and blurring public policy with private gain.

9. President Trump impounded congressionally approved aid to Ukraine (2025-03-04): Freezing Ukraine aid that Congress had appropriated challenged statutory limits on impoundment and reasserted executive control over spending decisions reserved to the legislature.

10. President Trump directed mass layoffs and restructuring across multiple federal agencies including IRS, VA, Social Security, Education, USPS, State, and others (2025-03-04): Coordinated workforce cuts and restructurings across core agencies centralized power in political appointees, hollowed neutral capacity, and made public services more dependent on loyalists and contractors.

11. President Trump celebrated clampdowns on immigration and asylum and called for more funding for border crackdowns (2025-03-05): Using a high‑profile address to champion harsher immigration and asylum enforcement framed restrictive border policies as central to national policy, reinforcing executive latitude over migrants’ rights.

12. President Trump renamed Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge after Jocelyn Nungaray via executive order (2025-03-05): Renaming a federal refuge after a crime victim allegedly killed by undocumented immigrants used symbolic executive power to embed an anti‑immigrant narrative in public space and policy messaging.

13. President Trump reversed a plan to deport Ukrainian asylum seekers with temporary legal status (2025-03-05): Walking back a planned mass removal of Ukrainians after public backlash showed how sweeping executive control over humanitarian status can abruptly reshape the security of large migrant groups.

14. President Trump issued executive orders adjusting tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods to address drug flows while easing impacts on auto parts (2025-03-06): Tweaking border duties by decree to balance drug‑control rhetoric with auto‑industry concerns highlighted how tariff levers are wielded unilaterally for both security and economic aims.

15. President Trump issued an executive order targeting Perkins Coie LLP’s security clearances and federal business (2025-03-06): Ordering reviews and suspensions of clearances and contracts for a specific law firm that had represented political opponents used state power in a personalized way that risks politicizing security and procurement.

16. President Trump signed a memo urging agencies to require upfront fees from those suing the administration (2025-03-06): Pushing agencies to demand upfront fees from litigants seeking to challenge federal actions threatened to price many individuals and groups out of court, weakening judicial checks on executive power.

17. President Trump issued an executive order revising Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility to exclude certain organizations (2025-03-07): Redefining which public‑service employers qualify for loan forgiveness allowed the administration to financially pressure organizations engaged in disfavored work, narrowing who can sustainably serve in civil society roles.

18. President Trump signed an executive order pausing tariffs on USMCA trade with Canada and Mexico until April 2 (2025-03-07): Temporarily suspending newly announced USMCA tariffs underscored how abrupt executive trade moves can unsettle markets and allies, with little predictable legislative input.

19. President Trump told cabinet secretaries they, not Elon Musk, were in charge of their departments (2025-03-07): Reassuring cabinet officials about their authority implicitly acknowledged concerns over an unelected adviser’s influence, highlighting blurred lines between formal and informal power in executive governance.

20. President Trump established a White House Task Force on the 2026 FIFA World Cup (2025-03-07): Creating a presidential task force to coordinate World Cup preparations centralized oversight of a major international event, illustrating routine but expansive use of White House coordinating structures.


Institutions and Governance

1. Representative Eli Crane filed articles of impeachment against Judge Paul Engelmayer (2025-03-01): Targeting a judge who ruled against the Department of Government Efficiency signaled partisan efforts to intimidate the judiciary for decisions adverse to administration policy.

House of Representatives passed a budget resolution launching reconciliation to extend Trump‑era tax cuts and cut safety‑net programs (2025-03-02): Advancing a budget that pairs extended high‑end tax cuts with Medicaid and benefit reductions showed Congress using fiscal tools to shift resources upward and constrain social supports.

10. U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board ordered temporary reinstatement of thousands of fired USDA probationary employees (2025-03-05): Reinstating nearly 6,000 Agriculture employees pending review signaled that mass terminations likely violated civil‑service protections and checked executive attempts to purge staff.

11. U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid (2025-03-04): By upholding lower‑court orders to unfreeze appropriated foreign aid, the Court reaffirmed congressional control over spending and limited unilateral executive impoundment.

12. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered a senior CFPB official to testify about the agency’s compliance with its statutory duties (2025-03-04): Compelling testimony on whether the CFPB was actually performing its legal functions strengthened judicial scrutiny of attempts to quietly disable a consumer‑protection agency.

18. Newsmax agreed to pay $40 million to settle Smartmatic’s defamation lawsuit over 2020 election lies (2025-03-07): A large settlement for broadcasting false election claims showed courts can impose meaningful costs on media outlets that spread disinformation undermining electoral legitimacy.

19. Judge John McConnell ruled that President Trump lacked authority to freeze congressionally appropriated funding in New York v. Trump (2025-03-07): Holding that the president could not unilaterally halt appropriated funds reaffirmed separation of powers and Congress’s exclusive power of the purse.


Economic Structure

1. President Trump announced and implemented sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, then partially suspended or delayed them (2025-03-04): Imposing and then adjusting broad tariffs on key trading partners disrupted supply chains, raised consumer prices, and injected uncertainty into the global trading system.

2. Haltbakk Bunkers banned fuel sales to U.S. companies and military forces in Norway (2025-03-01): A Norwegian fuel supplier’s boycott of U.S. entities in protest of Ukraine policy illustrated how foreign firms can use economic leverage to signal disapproval of U.S. actions.

6. Environmental Protection Agency issued several Superfund and hazardous‑waste regulatory actions and settlements (2025-03-03): Updating hazardous‑waste exclusions, proposing Superfund settlements, and deleting cleaned sites from the National Priorities List showed ongoing use of environmental law to manage industrial pollution and cost recovery.

7. U.S. Department of Education and DOGE cut nearly $1 billion from education research and canceled $900 million in student data contracts (2025-03-03): Slashing funding for education statistics and research undermined the data infrastructure needed to evaluate school performance and equity, weakening evidence‑based policy.

4. Trump administration and Congress advanced or prepared measures that could restrict voting and representation, including the SAVE Act and billionaire‑funded judicial races (2025-03-02): Proposed ID rules likely to disenfranchise name‑changing women and heavy elite spending in court races threatened equal access to the ballot and impartial adjudication of election law.

Information, Memory and Manipulation

1. Trump administration and CISA deprioritized monitoring of Russian cyber threats and election interference (2025-03-03): Instructing analysts not to track Russian cyber activity, including against election systems, reduced institutional awareness of a known threat and impaired defenses for democratic infrastructure.

2. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. Cyber Command ordered or implemented a halt to planning and operations against Russia in cyberspace (2025-03-02): Pausing offensive cyber operations against Russia, amid conflicting public statements, created uncertainty about U.S. cyber posture and potentially emboldened a hostile actor.
