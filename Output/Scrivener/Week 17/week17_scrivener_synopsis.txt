Week 17 of Trump’s second term left the Democracy Clock frozen at 7:59 p.m., but the machinery behind it tightened. The administration openly toyed with suspending habeas corpus for migrants, explored labeling border crossings a “rebellion” or “invasion,” and leaned on the Alien Enemies Act to accelerate deportations, even as courts issued injunctions and due‑process rulings that partially slowed the drive. Immigration and security tools were turned inward: ICE arrested Newark’s mayor at a detention‑facility protest, disability‑rights activists and campus demonstrators were swept up, and critics from Hasan Piker to James Comey faced border questioning or threat investigations. At the same time, citizenship and protection were recast along racial and ideological lines, with selective refugee offers, TPS termination for Afghans, and executive orders targeting non‑citizens’ views while the Supreme Court heard challenges to Trump’s birthright‑citizenship order. Foreign money and personal enrichment, centered on Qatar’s $400 million jet and a $5.5 billion golf project, blurred public policy with private gain. Independent media, universities, libraries, and the civil service absorbed fresh blows, even as scattered courts, agencies, and civil‑society actors kept pockets of rule‑bound governance alive.
