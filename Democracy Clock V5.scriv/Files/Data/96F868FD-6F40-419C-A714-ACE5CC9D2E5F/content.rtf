\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 29 of Trump\'92s second term brought only a 0.1\uc0\u8209 minute shift toward midnight on the Democracy Clock, leaving public time frozen at 7:58 p.m., yet the institutional pressure was immense. Executive orders on tariffs, homelessness, banking, and retirement accounts extended unilateral control over markets and social policy. A directive for a new census excluding undocumented immigrants aimed to redraw representation itself. In Texas and Indiana, redistricting fights escalated into fines, arrest warrants, and FBI involvement against quorum\u8209 breaking Democrats, while federal prosecutors targeted Jack Smith, Letitia James, and Obama\u8209 era officials. Immigration enforcement hardened into a semi\u8209 permanent carceral infrastructure built on military bases and private contracts, despite mounting reports of abuse. Universities were coerced through funding freezes, ideological settlements, and data\u8209 surveillance demands. The firing of the labor statistics chief and sidelining of crime data signaled open manipulation of official numbers. Resistance\'97from state lawmakers, tribes, environmental groups, and some courts\'97persisted but could not offset the week\'92s consolidation of partisan rule.\
