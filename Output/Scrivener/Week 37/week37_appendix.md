# Week 37 Appendix: Shutdown as Instrument of Rule

This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the Trump administration using a manufactured shutdown, militarized immigration crackdowns, and information warfare to deepen control. Structurally, the heaviest pressure fell on civil service neutrality, federalism, protest rights, and the boundary between policing and war. The shutdown is not just dysfunction: it is being weaponized to purge and intimidate federal workers, freeze or cancel disfavored states’ projects, and threaten “irreversible” cuts to social programs, sharply worsening traits 6, 11, 22, 35, 37, and 40. In parallel, the Portland deployment, Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, and Hegseth’s Quantico summit mark a decisive turn toward domestic militarization and loyalty enforcement in the armed forces (traits 5, 8, 9, 41, 46, 50). Immigration and asylum are being recast as security threats, with courts partially resisting but also greenlighting racial profiling and TPS terminations (traits 4, 14, 47). Information space is flooded with deepfakes, pseudoscience, and partisan use of agency channels, while Voice of America is silenced (traits 43, 52–54, 60). Overall, the week shows a regime deliberately using chaos—shutdown, foreign “wars,” and domestic enemies—to disable oversight and normalize exceptional powers.

Week 37 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump ordered federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings tied to shutdown funding (2025-09-28): The directive to ready mass firings of federal workers in the event of a shutdown used executive power to threaten the civil service, risking long-term damage to government capacity and neutral administration.

13.

7.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought canceled or froze billions in climate and infrastructure funding in Democratic areas (2025-10-01): Halting climate and transit projects in blue states and cities during a shutdown used budgetary control to punish disfavored jurisdictions and reshape policy priorities without new legislation.

15.

Economic Structure
