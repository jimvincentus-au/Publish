In the background, out of focus, a model border wall and a miniature golden jet sit under a glass dome. Painterly, realistic style, rich but somber tones, no human faces, no text.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit Capitol dome seen through the transparent face of a large, old mechanical clock, its gears visibly straining under new, heavy weights labeled only by abstract symbols of money bags, barbed wire, and courthouse columns. In the midground, a long line of people waits outside a federal building while, on a distant hill, a gleaming missile shield installation rises. The scene is painterly and realistic, with muted colors and dramatic shadows, conveying institutional strain and quiet consolidation of power, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 18 is a study in structural consolidation rather than spectacle. The House forces through the One Big Beautiful Bill, a reconciliation megabill that locks in regressive tax cuts, slashes Medicaid and SNAP, and funds an expanded deportation and detention regime. Corporate allies endorse it even as ratings agencies warn of ballooning deficits and rising risk offloaded onto the public. Immigration and law enforcement become instruments of hierarchy: Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is terminated, refugees are deported into stateless limbo, Harvard\u2019s foreign student program is revoked, and RICO is deployed against protesters while January 6 defendants receive mass pardons and settlements. Simultaneously, the civil service, consumer protection agencies, and oversight boards are purged or politicized, as the Supreme Court edges doctrine toward a unitary executive. Information and education are bent to partisan narratives. Courts and civil society win scattered injunctions, but the week\u2019s real movement is the quiet hardwiring of inequality and executive impunity.",
