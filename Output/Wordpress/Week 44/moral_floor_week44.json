    "summary": "This week exhibited a troubling consolidation of authoritarian practices, with significant breaches of democratic norms, particularly in character, ethics, and restraint. The executive's actions, including calls for violence against political opponents and the use of investigations as political tools, further eroded the moral floor. However, there were notable instances of resistance from Congress and the judiciary, suggesting a complex interplay of erosion and pushback.",

    "narrative": "The moral floor continues to deteriorate, with the executive branch increasingly treating public institutions as extensions of personal power. This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the static position of the Democracy Clock at 8:11 p.m.",
