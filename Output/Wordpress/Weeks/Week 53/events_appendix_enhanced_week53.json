This surge of federal agents has been met with largely peaceful protests, with local leaders criticizing the move as federal overreach. The deployment is part of a broader strategy targeting cities led by Democratic politicians, which the administration claims is necessary to protect federal property and personnel. The presence of federal agents has heightened tensions in the state, particularly following the controversial shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer.",

This action was perceived as retaliation for their involvement in previous prosecutions against Trump related to the January 6 insurrection and other alleged crimes. The UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Margaret Satterthwaite, raised concerns about this move, highlighting it as part of a broader pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization.",
