\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Purpose and Scope
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock is a standing, longitudinal report designed to measure and document changes in the condition of democratic governance in the United States over time. It tracks both erosion and repair of democratic norms, institutions, and practices using a consistent, evidence-based framework.\
\
The purpose of the Democracy Clock is not to persuade, predict, or provoke. It exists to 
\f2\b make democratic change legible
\f1\b0 \'97particularly when that change is incremental, normalized, or obscured by political noise. Democracies rarely collapse in a single moment. They degrade, or recover, through the accumulation of decisions, precedents, and institutional shifts. The Democracy Clock is built to record that accumulation.\
\
The report is intended for use by journalists and producers seeking factual grounding; policy staff and institutional leaders monitoring governance risk; educators and researchers studying democratic systems; and citizens seeking explanation rather than commentary. It is published as a public record and updated on a fixed cadence.\
\
The Democracy Clock is not an opinion column, an electoral forecast, or a partisan advocacy document. It does not evaluate political actors based on ideology or popularity. It measures democratic condition as expressed through verifiable actions and institutional outcomes.\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Conceptual Framework: Time as Democratic Condition
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock uses time as a metaphor for democratic condition. 
\f2\b Noon
\f1\b0  represents a fully functioning democratic republic. 
\f2\b Midnight
\f1\b0  represents democratic collapse or the consolidation of authoritarian rule. Movement toward or away from midnight reflects structural change, not sentiment, polling, or rhetoric.\
\
This framing is deliberate. Democratic decline is rarely abrupt. It proceeds through cumulative and often legal actions: the normalization of emergency powers, the erosion of oversight, the politicization of courts, the weakening of electoral safeguards, or the degradation of information integrity. Time-based framing captures direction, momentum, and persistence in a way that isolated headlines cannot.\
\
The Clock is explicitly 
\f2\b bidirectional
\f1\b0 . Democratic repair\'97through institutional strengthening, restoration of norms, judicial independence, electoral protection, or reassertion of legislative authority\'97can and does move the clock away from midnight. The framework is designed to record recovery as rigorously as decline.\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Measurement Domains and Criteria
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock evaluates documented events across multiple democratic domains, including but not limited to:\
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	Electoral integrity and administration\
	\'95	Rule of law and judicial independence\
	\'95	Separation of powers and legislative oversight\
	\'95	Civil liberties and political rights\
	\'95	Information integrity and media independence\
	\'95	Institutional accountability and transparency\
	\'95	Use and abuse of emergency or extraordinary powers\
\
An event is logged only if it meets three threshold criteria:\
\pard\tqr\tx260\tx420\li420\fi-420\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0

\f4 \cf2 	1.	
\f2\b Verifiability
\f1\b0  \'96 The event is supported by credible public sources, including official records, court filings, or corroborated reporting.\

\f4 	2.	
\f2\b Concrete Action
\f1\b0  \'96 The event reflects a decision, action, or institutional change, not speculation or generalized rhetoric.\

\f4 	3.	
\f2\b Democratic Relevance
\f1\b0  \'96 The event plausibly affects democratic structure, rights, or accountability beyond transient political messaging.\
\
Statements alone are logged only when they are accompanied by formal authority, policy implementation, or institutional consequence. The report does not score tone, intent, or popularity. It documents effects.\
\
Each qualifying event is assessed for direction (erosive or restorative), scope (localized or systemic), and durability (temporary, reversible, or precedent-setting).\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 How Time Moves: Methodology Summary
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock moves in discrete increments based on documented events. There are no preset weekly or monthly movement targets, and no effort is made to smooth or balance outcomes for narrative effect. When events warrant significant movement, the clock reflects that magnitude.\
\
Events are evaluated independently, then aggregated to determine net movement over a defined reporting period. No single event automatically determines trajectory; however, sustained patterns of institutional behavior carry cumulative weight.\
\
All clock movements are traceable to logged events. The methodology is applied consistently across time periods. When historical recalibration is necessary\'97for example, due to newly available information or clarified precedent\'97it is documented transparently rather than silently revised.\
\
The objective is not precision to the minute, but 
\f2\b consistency of judgment over time
\f1\b0 .\

Primary sources include:\
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	Federal and state government records\

Excluded from the log are anonymous claims without corroboration, social-media speculation, and opinion content lacking factual grounding.\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Update Cadence and Archival Practice
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock is updated on a regular schedule, with interim updates issued when major developments materially affect the democratic condition.\
\
Periodically, the record is preserved in 
\f2\b archival editions
\f1\b0 . These bound or fixed editions are immutable snapshots of the clock at a specific point in time. They are not retroactively altered. Subsequent editions document change rather than overwrite history. This practice ensures a durable public record that can be cited, audited, and compared across periods.\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Citation and Reuse
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock may be cited as a standing report. Individual entries may be cited by date and edition. Charts and tables are cleared for reuse with attribution.\
\
Journalists, educators, and institutions are encouraged to reuse excerpts unchanged with attribution. Analytical disagreement is welcomed and documented. The report\'92s authority rests not on unanimity, but on transparency and consistency.\

\f0\b\fs34 \cf2 Governance and Independence
\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The Democracy Clock operates independently of political parties, campaigns, or government institutions. It accepts no direction on findings and applies its framework uniformly.\
\
Errors are corrected transparently. Methodological changes are disclosed. The goal is not authority by assertion, but authority earned through disciplined process.\
\
The Democracy Clock exists to make democratic change visible\'97especially when it is incremental, normalized, or obscured. It is a public instrument for a public purpose: documenting whether democratic governance is weakening, holding, or being repaired, one documented step at a time.\
