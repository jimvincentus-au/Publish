The protests erupted following the arrest of 118 immigrants, with the Department of Homeland Security labeling many as criminals. However, local organizations, such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, dispute these claims, stating that the arrests were not based on judicial warrants. The deployment and arrests are part of a broader push by the Trump administration to increase deportations, with further enforcement actions expected.",
