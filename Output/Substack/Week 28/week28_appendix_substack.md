# Week 28 Appendix: Confinement as Governance

*With no single shock, the administration deepened a regime where law, welfare, and information serve personalized power and stratified citizenship.*

![Header image](image_wide_week28_appendix.png)

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and partisan power across multiple fronts, with courts, agencies, immigration enforcement, and trade policy all pulled deeper into a personalized, Trump‑centric project. Structurally, the heaviest pressure falls on judicial independence (Emil Bove’s confirmation despite whistleblower warnings; DOJ attacks on Judge Boasberg; politicized US attorney appointments), the rule of law in immigration and detention (Alien Enemies Act deportations, Alligator Alcatraz, Cecot flights defying court orders), and the stratification of citizenship by ancestry, race, and status (Vance’s redefinition of citizenship, DACA self‑deportation push, SNAP and Medicaid cuts, harsh detention of disabled migrants). Simultaneously, the administration weaponizes economic tools—tariffs, emergency powers, AI‑driven deregulation, and social program retrenchment—to reward allies, punish adversaries at home and abroad, and obscure accountability. Universities and media are squeezed through funding threats, politicized investigations, and licensing leverage, while state‑level moves in Texas and North Carolina entrench gerrymanders and voter suppression. There are pockets of resistance—federal courts blocking birthright and Planned Parenthood cuts, multistate lawsuits, investigative journalism correcting abuses—but the net effect is a marked entrenchment of authoritarian methods inside nominally legal and electoral frameworks.

Power and Authority

1. President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency used an AI tool to generate a large-scale deregulation "delete list" (2025-07-26): The administration’s DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool aimed to eliminate up to half of federal rules with minimal public oversight, shifting vast regulatory power into opaque executive-controlled algorithms.

2. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moved to remove all members of a key preventive health task force (2025-07-26): Replacing an entire federal preventive health advisory panel with ideologically aligned appointees concentrated control of health guidance in political hands, weakening expert-based checks on executive health policy.

3. President Trump signed a rescissions package cutting previously appropriated funds (2025-07-26): Using rescissions to claw back congressionally approved spending, including for education, expanded executive leverage over the power of the purse and tested statutory limits on impoundment.

4. Federal Emergency Management Agency launched a detention support grant program for temporary migrant facilities (2025-07-26): FEMA’s new $608 million grant program to build temporary migrant detention centers expanded federal capacity to confine noncitizens, deepening executive control over vulnerable populations.

5. President Trump publicly demanded prosecution of prominent Black public figures without evidence (2025-07-26): Calling for criminal charges against Kamala Harris, Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and Al Sharpton absent evidence signaled willingness to wield prosecutorial power rhetorically against political and cultural opponents.

6. President Trump enacted massive Medicaid cuts through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025-07-27): Cutting over $1 trillion from Medicaid and offering only limited rural offsets shifted health burdens onto low-income Americans and states, using federal spending power to reshape social rights.

7. White House budget chief Russell Vought announced exploration of pocket rescissions to withhold congressionally allocated funds (2025-07-27): Considering pocket rescissions to let appropriated funds expire would let the executive nullify spending laws without repeal, eroding Congress’s control over federal resources.

8. CIA Director John Ratcliffe refused to rule out treason indictments against former senior officials (2025-07-27): Floating possible treason charges against Brennan, Comey, and Hillary Clinton over alleged conspiracies against Trump blurred intelligence work with partisan retribution and threatened to criminalize prior oversight.

9. President Trump accepted a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar to serve as Air Force One (2025-07-28): Accepting a $400 million aircraft from Qatar as Air Force One, later funded through opaque budget transfers, raised serious emoluments and foreign influence concerns around core state assets.

10. President Trump issued an executive order enabling mass detention of homeless people (2025-07-28): The "Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets" order empowered sweeping arrests and camp-style detention of homeless individuals, expanding coercive executive authority over a marginalized group.

11. Trump administration authorized federal employees to proselytize and pray publicly at work (2025-07-28): New guidance allowing federal workers to promote their faith on the job blurred church–state boundaries and risked embedding favored religious expression within government operations.

12. Trump administration froze over $100 million in federal research funding to Duke University over affirmative action (2025-07-30): Halting NIH research funds to Duke unless it abandoned race-conscious practices used federal purse strings to coerce university policy on diversity and hiring.

13. President Trump ordered construction of a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom (2025-07-30): Authorizing a $200 million, donor-funded ballroom to replace the East Wing redirected substantial resources and symbolic space toward leader-centered spectacle at the seat of government.

14. President Trump issued an executive order imposing a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports and declaring a national emergency (2025-07-30): Using emergency powers to levy steep tariffs on Brazil in response to its internal politics and treatment of Bolsonaro showed economic coercion deployed through unilateral executive action.

15. President Trump suspended duty-free de minimis treatment for all countries (2025-07-30): Eliminating duty-free treatment for low-value imports via executive order centralized control over a large slice of trade policy in the presidency under a national security rationale.

16. President Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% through executive order (2025-07-31): Increasing tariffs on Canadian imports and citing drugs and Palestine policy as justifications used emergency trade powers to punish a close ally over political disagreements.

17. President Trump further modified reciprocal tariff rates on multiple trading partners (2025-07-31): An order adjusting reciprocal tariff rates across countries entrenched the president’s use of emergency economic authorities to unilaterally reshape trade relationships.

18. Office of Personnel Management allowed federal employees to publicly pray and evangelize at work (2025-07-31): OPM’s memo institutionalizing public prayer and persuasion in federal workplaces risked privileging certain faiths and pressuring subordinates, altering norms of religious neutrality in government.

19. President Trump announced new global tariff base rates just before a self-imposed deadline (2025-08-01): Setting broad 10–15% tariff baselines by executive fiat, amid ongoing court challenges to his trade authority, underscored the presidency’s expanded unilateral role in economic governance.

20. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described new "Trump accounts" as a backdoor to privatize Social Security (2025-07-31): Framing new retirement accounts as a path to privatize Social Security signaled executive intent to shift core social insurance from public guarantees toward market-based instruments.

21. President Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on dozens of countries (2025-07-31): Rolling out tariffs from 10% to 41% on a wide range of countries in one move used trade shocks as a blunt geopolitical tool, increasing executive leverage over foreign and domestic actors.


Institutions and Governance

11.

12.

20. Oklahoma Schools Chief Ryan Walters announced a "MAGA Exam" for out-of-state teachers seeking certification (2025-07-31): Requiring teachers from liberal states to pass an ideologically framed exam tied certification to adherence to "America First" narratives, politicizing entry into the profession.
