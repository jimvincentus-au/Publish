\f0\fs26 \cf0 Metadata for Week 20\
====================\
\
Title\
-----\
Stratified Citizenship as Policy\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A week of layered consolidation, where law, budgets, borders, and data were tuned to favor allies while keeping democratic institutions formally intact.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
No new breach, but a denser web: law, money, borders, and data quietly rewire who the state protects and who it leaves exposed.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 20 is a study in consolidation rather than rupture. The Democracy Clock holds at 7:51 p.m., yet the architecture of a stratified democracy grows more defined. In Congress, the House advances the \'93Big, Beautiful Bill,\'94 extending tax cuts while slashing Medicaid, food aid, housing, and disaster preparedness, and carving bespoke protections for a foreign-owned mine shielded from public lawsuits. Parallel moves on a Trump-linked stablecoin and the GENIUS Act entwine policy with donor and family financial interests. The executive branch widens travel bans, targets Harvard\'92s foreign students, and unleashes aggressive ICE raids backed by National Guard and Marines, while a union leader is arrested in an immigration sweep. Courts offer scattered relief to migrants and speakers, but the Supreme Court\'92s shadow-docket orders empower Doge, a Musk-led entity, to mine Social Security data and displace neutral civil servants. Cuts to FEMA, NOAA, VA care, and reproductive protections hollow the safety state even as surveillance, policing, and information control deepen.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
The clock stays at 7:51 p.m. as law, budgets, borders, and data are recalibrated to harden inequality, stratify citizenship, and privatize state power, with only scattered institutional pushback.\

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock remains at 7:51 p.m., with no change from Week 19\'92s 471.1 minutes before midnight. This apparent stillness masks a week of consolidation, as advances in authoritarian traits were offset by prior fragility and pockets of judicial and civic resistance, yielding structural hardening without a fresh lurch toward midnight.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A 1:1 symbolic still life: a brass balance scale on a worn wooden desk. On one side, a stack of legal codes, data drives, and corporate coins; on the other, a Medicaid card, a refugee passport, and a hurricane warning map. Behind the scale, a small clock frozen at 7:51 and a faded civil service badge lie under a thin layer of dust. Soft, directional light emphasizes the unequal weight of the objects, in a painterly, realistic style.", "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of a grand government building whose facade is intact but whose interior glows with harsh, segmented light. In the foreground, a large clock reads 7:51, its hands motionless, while below it a crowd is divided by invisible barriers: some stand in a brightly lit, guarded lane, others wait in shadow behind fencing and data terminals. Rows of computer servers and surveillance monitors spill out of side doors, watched over by uniformed officers and suited executives. The atmosphere is tense but orderly, suggesting consolidation of control rather than open chaos, rendered in a painterly, realistic style."\}\
