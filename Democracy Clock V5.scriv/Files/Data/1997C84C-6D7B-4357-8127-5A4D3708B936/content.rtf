\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 23 Appendix: Force as System of Rule\
\
This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran without congressional authorization, followed by a Supreme Court decision sharply limiting nationwide injunctions. Together they expand executive freedom of action while constraining judicial remedies, directly intensifying traits 1 and 4 (unchecked executive power and law as weapon). Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is transformed into a sprawling, semi-militarized apparatus: masked agents, record detentions, new mega\uc0\u8209 facilities, and plans to dismiss asylum claims and deport to third countries, all amid credible allegations of DOJ defiance of court orders. That cluster drives severe deterioration in rule of law, stratified citizenship, and security forces aligned with regime priorities. Information control and epistemic sabotage deepen: mass firings and defunding threats at Voice of America, politicized vaccine panels and anti\u8209 science decisions, and systematic contradiction of U.S. intelligence on Iran. Courts and some state actors still resist\'97blocking parts of emergency declarations, ordering return of a deportee, protecting federal workers\'92 bargaining rights\'97but these are outweighed by structural moves that entrench authoritarian tools in war powers, immigration, public health governance, and the information sphere.\

Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1. Trump administration and senior officials contradicted and sidelined U.S. intelligence assessments to justify Iran strikes (2025-06-23): By dismissing intelligence that Iran was not building a bomb and relying instead on disputed Israeli claims, the administration politicized threat information to sell a controversial war.\

President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted the Iran strikes were a spectacular success despite contrary intelligence (2025-06-26): Doubling down on claims of \'93total obliteration\'94 of Iran\'92s nuclear program while DIA and IAEA assessments said otherwise exemplified narrative control over empirical evaluation of military actions.\
\
3. Pentagon and FBI launched a criminal leak investigation into the DIA assessment on Iran strikes (2025-06-26): Investigating the leak of an intelligence report that contradicted the White House narrative risked deterring whistleblowing and press scrutiny of contested national-security claims.\

\
8. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused media of cheering against Trump over Iran coverage (2025-06-25): Portraying critical reporting on the Iran operation as unpatriotic undermined the press\'92s watchdog role and framed independent scrutiny as disloyalty to the military.\
\
9. Trump administration and DHS threatened Harvard\'92s SEVP certification and expanded investigations into university hiring (2025-06-23): Threatening to revoke Harvard\'92s ability to host foreign students and probing UC\'92s hiring practices used federal power to pressure universities over perceived ideological noncompliance.\
\
10. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and CDC replaced vaccine advisory experts with skeptics and advanced anti-thimerosal messaging (2025-06-26): Installing vaccine skeptics on ACIP, circulating a nonexistent study, and voting to restrict thimerosal despite evidence undermined scientific consensus and public trust in immunization policy.\
\
11. Vice President J.D. Vance misidentified Senator Alex Padilla as a convicted criminal during a press event (2025-06-21): Linking a Latino senator\'92s name to that of a convicted terrorist blurred fact and insinuation, using association to tarnish a political opponent\'92s reputation.\
\
12.

\
14. Los Angeles County Sheriff\'92s Department deleted and apologized for a social-media post sympathetic to victims of U.S. Iran strikes (2025-06-23): The quick removal and apology for a message mourning foreign civilian casualties showed how law-enforcement communications are tightly policed in line with national narratives on war.\
\
15. Trump administration and DOJ pressured the University of Virginia and other institutions over DEI and hiring policies (2025-06-27): Federal investigations into DEI and hiring at major universities, culminating in UVA\'92s president\'92s resignation, signaled a campaign to reshape academic discourse and governance through legal leverage.\
\
16. President Donald Trump called for cancellation of Benjamin Netanyahu\'92s corruption trial as a witch hunt (2025-06-26): Urging that a foreign leader\'92s bribery and fraud trial be scrapped as a \'93witch hunt\'94 exported Trump\'92s delegitimization of legal accountability to another democracy\'92s justice system.\
\
17. California Governor Gavin Newsom filed a major defamation suit against Fox News and Jesse Watters over an edited clip (2025-06-26): Newsom\'92s $787 million claim over allegedly deceptive editing tested whether courts can deter misinformation by powerful outlets without unduly constraining political journalism.\
