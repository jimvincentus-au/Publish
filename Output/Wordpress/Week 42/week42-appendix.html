<h1>Week 42 Appendix: Hunger and Pardons as Power</h1>
<p><em>A week of shutdown brinkmanship, militarized enforcement, and pay-to-play clemency showed law, welfare, and knowledge bent to serve executive will.</em></p>
<p>This week combines an extraordinary concentration of authoritarian-style executive abuses with a surprisingly strong, though still outgunned, democratic backlash. On the decay side, the Trump administration openly defies court orders on SNAP, stretches war powers in multiple theaters, threatens domestic military deployment under the Insurrection Act, and issues sweeping pardons for 2020 election subversion and other elite allies. Immigration enforcement hardens into a quasi-militarized, partly privatized system targeting immigrants and communities, while Congress funds a vast expansion of ICE detention. Regulatory and patronage scandals—from Extremity Care’s secret ballroom donation to Binance and McMahon pardons—underscore crony capitalism and the conversion of public tragedy and shutdown pain into leverage and profit. Simultaneously, courts and voters mount meaningful resistance: judges order full SNAP funding and push back on politicized prosecutions; Pennsylvania retains a pro-democracy supreme court; Maine voters reject voter ID; Democrats win key governorships and local offices; and California’s Prop 50, though itself a partisan gerrymander, is framed as a counter to earlier abuses. The net structural pressure tilts heavily toward entrenched executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and weaponized law, but the electoral and judicial pushback shows core democratic circuits still firing.</p>
