# Week 4 Appendix: DOGE as Parallel Statecraft

*Trump and Musk quietly converted the federal bureaucracy into a pliable, privatized instrument, using money, law, and memory to tilt power inward and downward.*

![Header image](image_wide_week4_appendix.png)

This week shows an aggressive acceleration of authoritarian structural change, centered on executive aggrandizement, civil service purge, and information control, partially checked by unusually assertive courts and civil society. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus moved from rhetoric to implementation: mass layoffs, buyout schemes, and a new hiring choke-point effectively politicize and shrink the federal workforce, while attempts to shutter or hollow out USAID, Education, CFPB, NIH, NSF, NOAA, NASA DEI, and Social Security operations rewire the administrative state toward loyalist and private interests. Simultaneously, the administration paused FCPA enforcement, meddled in DOJ corruption cases, and signaled possible debt repudiation, fusing crony capitalism with legal impunity. On the rights side, immigration crackdowns, anti-trans orders, DEI erasure, and militarized ICE practices deepen stratified citizenship. Information space is sharply contested: federal web purges, Pentagon school book removals, AP bans, and curated DOGE data sit alongside court orders restoring health pages and blocking NIH cuts. Internationally, Gaza annexation talk and resource-for-support demands on Ukraine reveal a transactional, destabilizing foreign policy. The judiciary, inspectors-general lawsuits, state suits, and mass public calling campaigns provide real but embattled counter-pressure.

3. President Trump cut federal funding and ordered a stop-work for a Colorado immigrant legal services nonprofit (2025-01-20): Halting funds for a key immigrant legal aid provider weakened access to counsel for undocumented people in removal proceedings, using executive power to narrow due process protections for a disfavored group.

7. President Trump signed executive orders directing health agencies to scrub diversity-related terms and content from websites and research (2025-01-20): Mandating removal of race, gender, disability and LGBTQ terms from health sites and proposals used executive power to constrain what public institutions can say about marginalized groups and health disparities.

8.

9. President Trump and Elon Musk repurposed the U.S. Digital Service into DOGE with authority to cancel payments, suspend programs, and target employees (2025-01-20): Transforming a technical service unit into DOGE with sweeping, opaque power over spending and personnel created a parallel executive apparatus with limited oversight over core state functions.

24. President Trump signed an executive order pausing disbursement of LIHEAP and home energy rebate funds, causing surcharges for low-income customers (2025-01-20): Freezing congressionally funded energy assistance shifted immediate costs onto low-income households and illustrated how executive impoundment can function as de facto policy reversal without legislation.

25. President Trump announced a plan to seize and hold Gaza and relocate Palestinians elsewhere (2025-02-10): Proposing U.S. seizure of Gaza and permanent removal of Palestinians framed foreign policy as territorial acquisition, disregarding self-determination norms and signaling openness to large-scale forced displacement.

26. President Trump announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and ordered development of a broader reciprocal tariff plan (2025-02-11): Imposing and planning expansive tariffs by presidential directive reoriented trade policy around unilateral executive decisions with significant downstream effects on prices, jobs, and international relations.

27. President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports in a separate statement (2025-02-11): A parallel announcement of 25% metal tariffs reinforced the administration’s readiness to use trade tools aggressively, despite warnings of higher consumer costs and intra-party criticism.

28. President Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council by executive order (2025-02-14): Creating a White House energy council to push domestic production and cut regulatory barriers centralized strategic energy decisions in a presidential advisory body with potential to favor extractive interests.

29. President Trump signed an executive order halting federal funding to schools and universities with COVID-19 vaccine mandates (2025-02-14): Conditioning education funding on dropping vaccine mandates used fiscal leverage to weaken public health measures and pressure institutions to align with executive preferences on medical policy.

30. President Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council to coordinate pro-production energy policy (2025-02-14): The new council embedded a pro-fossil-fuel agenda inside the Executive Office, enabling coordinated use of regulatory and fiscal tools to favor domestic extraction over environmental or climate concerns.

33. National Park Service removed references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument website under a sex-definition order (2025-02-13): Erasing trans references from the Stonewall site implemented an executive sex-definition policy in public memory, narrowing official recognition of LGBTQ history and contributions.


Institutions and Governance

Economic Structure

1.

Civil Rights and Dissent

1. Colorado ICE and SWAT teams conducted heavily armed raids in Denver-area apartments targeting alleged gang members, arresting mostly non-gang immigrants (2025-02-09): Militarized raids that netted few confirmed gang members but many immigrants heightened fear in undocumented communities and blurred lines between targeted enforcement and broad intimidation.

2. Trump administration continued and publicized large-scale ICE arrests nationwide with limited transparency on who was detained (2025-01-31): Arresting over 8,200 people in late January and releasing sparse data framed mass deportations as success while obscuring impacts on families and due process.

3. Border Czar Tom Homan criticized deportation numbers and sanctuary cities while planning more aggressive raids including against non-criminal immigrants (2025-02-10): Calls for stepped-up enforcement against non-criminal undocumented residents and sanctuary jurisdictions signaled a punitive approach to immigration that treats presence itself as grounds for coercive action.

4. Federal courts blocked Trump’s executive order banning transgender people from military service and restricting youth gender-affirming care (2025-02-13): Judicial stays on anti-trans military and healthcare orders temporarily protected LGBTQ individuals from exclusionary policies that would have curtailed equal access to service and care.

24. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced a shift away from prioritizing European security toward the Indo-Pacific (2025-02-12): Reorienting U.S. defense focus away from Europe placed more responsibility on allies for Ukraine and NATO, altering the security environment that underpins democratic resilience in the region.


Information, Memory and Manipulation

1. Trump administration and federal agencies systematically removed DEI, LGBTQ health, and climate content from thousands of federal web pages (2025-02-10): Coordinated deletion and alteration of diversity and climate information narrowed the public record on contested topics, using administrative control to reshape what citizens can easily learn from government sources.

2. National Security Agency leadership implemented a “Big Delete” of internal and public content containing 27 banned DEI-related words (2025-02-10): Purging content with banned terms like “privilege” and “inclusion” to comply with executive orders embedded ideological filters into information systems, risking loss of mission-critical material.

3. Elon Musk reposted a tweet exposing personal information about a judge’s daughter involved in a DOGE-related case (2025-02-10): Amplifying doxxing of a judge’s family member weaponized social media reach to intimidate the judiciary, blurring lines between online harassment and pressure on legal decision-makers.
