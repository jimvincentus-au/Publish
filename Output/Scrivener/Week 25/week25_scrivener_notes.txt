Metadata for Week 25
====================

Title
-----
Immunity as Architecture of Power

Subtitle
--------
A Supreme Court shield for presidents, a hollowed civil service, and militarized immigration enforcement converged to normalize emergency-style rule and partisan law.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
Doctrine, management, and spectacle fused into a presidency that decides first and answers later, as law and bureaucracy bent toward personal rule.

Synopses
--------
Long Synopsis:
Week 25 of Trump’s second term traced a coordinated tightening of power rather than a single rupture. The Supreme Court granted former presidents sweeping criminal immunity and curtailed nationwide injunctions, even as it cleared the way for mass federal layoffs and a State Department purge. Trump moved quickly into this space: ordering a strike on Iran without Congress, asserting sole authority over foreign relations, restricting lawmakers’ access to classified information, and treating statutes and appropriations as optional in education funding and a TikTok ban. Inside the state, loyalty purges at the NSA and National Security Council, deep cuts at State, FEMA, NOAA, USAID, and health agencies, and RFK Jr.’s capture of vaccine policy hollowed neutral capacity. Immigration became an authoritarian laboratory, with TPS terminations, third-country deportations, militarized raids, abusive detention, and dismantled DHS oversight. Law and information increasingly served as partisan weapons, while scattered court rulings and civil-society lawsuits struggled to keep pace. The Democracy Clock moved from 8:02 to 8:06 p.m., marking a sharp erosion of democratic safety.

Short Synopsis:
Supreme Court doctrine, executive improvisation, and bureaucratic purges aligned to insulate Trump from accountability, militarize immigration enforcement, and entrench a partisan, unequal political economy, while fragmented resistance fought rear-guard actions.

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock advanced from 8:02 p.m. to 8:06 p.m., a net shift of 4.7 minutes toward democratic midnight. This marks a significant erosion week, driven by expanded presidential immunity, civil-service hollowing, and militarized domestic enforcement.
- image_prompts: {"square": "A symbolic still life: a judge’s gavel cracked and resting beside a presidential seal, barbed wire coiled around a small model border wall, a worn Bible opened to a blank page, and a medical mask and vaccine vial pushed to the edge of the table. Behind them, a wall clock frozen at 8:06 p.m. and a stack of redacted documents. Dramatic, moody lighting, painterly realism, no text, no real faces.", "wide": "A dusk-lit panorama of Washington, D.C., with the Supreme Court, the Capitol, and the White House connected by faint glowing wires to a single oversized clock reading 8:06 p.m. National Guard trucks and armored vehicles roll through a city street lined with immigration detention buses and floodwaters in the distance. The sky is heavy and smoky, with faint storm clouds, and government office windows are darkened as if emptied. Painterly, realistic style, no recognizable politicians, no text."}
