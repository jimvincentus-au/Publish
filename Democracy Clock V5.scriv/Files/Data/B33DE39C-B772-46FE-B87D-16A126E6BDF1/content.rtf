\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 11 fixes the Democracy Clock at 7:49 p.m., but the stillness is deceptive. The administration declared a trade \'93national emergency,\'94 imposing sweeping tariffs that rattled markets, sidelined Congress, and rewarded fossil-fuel allies and geopolitical favorites. Inside government, mass layoffs at HHS and across agencies, driven by Elon Musk\'92s unofficial DOGE operation, hollowed public-health and regulatory capacity while outsourcing state power to a private billionaire. Federal resources were weaponized against disfavored jurisdictions and universities, with punitive funding freezes for Washington, D.C., Maine, Columbia, and Harvard, and ideological directives for the Smithsonian. Immigration and security tools were turned on foreign students, migrants, and perceived internal enemies, even as some courts ordered unlawful deportees returned. Voting rules tightened through executive order and the SAVE Act, and a North Carolina ruling threatened to discard tens of thousands of ballots, even as Wisconsin voters preserved a liberal high court. Chaos itself emerged as a governing method, fragmenting oversight while scattered judicial and legislative pushback barely held the line.\
