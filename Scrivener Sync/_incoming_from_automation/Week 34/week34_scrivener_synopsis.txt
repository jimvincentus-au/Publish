Week 34 of Trump’s second term marked a consolidation of power rather than a new departure. The administration deployed National Guard troops into Washington and Memphis and threatened similar moves in Chicago and Baltimore, turning security forces into visible instruments of regime theater. Immigration raids at factories and in Latino neighborhoods, blessed by a Supreme Court willing to legalize racial profiling and detentive stops, signaled that certain communities could be treated as enemy territory. Courts and agencies helped widen executive latitude over tariffs, foreign aid, and independent commissions, while Congress largely performed rather than checked. Federal punishment fell hardest on Democratic-led jurisdictions, immigrants, students with disabilities, and colleges serving students of color. At the same time, Epstein records were buried, watchdogs sidelined, and a 40‑year peace vigil dismantled, curating memory and shielding elites. Pockets of resistance—in state policies, protests, and a few court rulings—persisted but could not offset systemic erosion. The Democracy Clock edged from 11:18 to 11:20 p.m., reflecting deepening grooves of unrestrained power.
