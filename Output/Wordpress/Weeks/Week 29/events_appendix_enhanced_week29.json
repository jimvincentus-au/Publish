These tariffs are part of Trump's broader trade policy, which has disrupted global markets and raised concerns about inflation. The tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices in the US, affecting retailers like Walmart and Best Buy. The policy has led to significant changes in the cost of back-to-school supplies, prompting concerns among US families about rising expenses.",
