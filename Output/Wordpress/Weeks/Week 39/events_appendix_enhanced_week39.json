The redistricting effort is set to take place during an October legislative session, following calls from Donald Trump for state legislatures to defend the Republican congressional majority. North Carolina currently has 14 congressional districts, with 10 held by Republicans, and the new maps are expected to further solidify Republican control.",

The detentions followed confrontations between police and demonstrators who were instructed to remain in designated \"protest zones.\" Tensions escalated as officers moved to clear the roadway, resulting in physical altercations where officers tackled and dragged several individuals. The detained protesters, aged 23 to 44, face charges related to resisting, obstruction, or disobeying an officer. The protest was part of ongoing demonstrations against ICE's practices at the facility.",
