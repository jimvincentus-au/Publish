Week 55 Appendix: Security As Everyday Governance
This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic stress, centered on three converging fronts: immigration enforcement as a domestic security tool, federal encroachment on elections, and the fusion of public power with private enrichment. ICE and DHS operations in Minneapolis, Portland, schools, and detention centers—paired with lethal force, child detentions, secretive deportation flights, and aggressive tactics against protesters and journalists—pushed traits 9, 11, 22, 41, 42, and 50 sharply toward authoritarian policing. Simultaneously, the Trump administration’s multi-pronged effort to nationalize election control—DOJ lawsuits for voter rolls, FBI raids on Fulton County, proof-of-citizenship orders, SAVE Act pushes, and open talk of ICE at polling places—exerted major pressure on voter access and state control (traits 1, 4, 11, 45, 52). Executive moves to strip civil service protections, weaponize funding (Harvard, Gateway project, arts grants), and monetize foreign and crypto ties entrenched crony capitalism and unchecked executive power (traits 1, 7, 16, 22, 24, 38). Countervailing forces—federal courts blocking TPS termination and ICE tear gas, state-level voting-rights bills, redistricting wins, and mass protests—registered as meaningful but outweighed defensive responses rather than structural repair.
