  "long_synopsis": "Week 31 of Trump\u2019s second term registered only a 0.2\u2011minute shift on the Democracy Clock, from 8:06 to 8:07 p.m., but the movement masked a deeper consolidation. In Washington, D.C., a manufactured crime \u201cemergency\u201d justified federalizing the local police, importing armed National Guard units, embedding military lawyers in civilian courts, and ordering prosecutors to seek maximum charges while relaxing some gun laws. Similar logics spread outward: immigration and visa systems became instruments of ideological sorting and fear, with continuous vetting of 55 million visa holders, mass student visa revocations, TPS rollbacks, and militarized, outsourced deportation infrastructure. Law was wielded to pardon January 6 offenders, pressure courts over loyal election criminals, impanel grand juries on debunked \u201ctreason\u201d theories, and selectively manage Epstein records. Elections were re\u2011engineered through partisan maps, attacks on mail voting, and new registration hurdles. Meanwhile, unions, data guardians, climate and vaccine science, and even Smithsonian exhibits came under pressure to align with regime narratives. Courts, civil servants, and activists mounted important but fragmented resistance.",
