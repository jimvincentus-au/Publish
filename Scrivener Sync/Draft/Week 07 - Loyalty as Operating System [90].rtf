In Week 7, the pattern that had been forming since the start of Trump\'92s second term came into sharper focus. The week did not turn on a single shock, but on the steady tightening of control over the state\'92s machinery and the stories the country tells itself. Executive orders, budget frameworks, and personnel moves reached into agencies, universities, courts, and borders. Together they pushed the system toward a version of government where loyalty and wealth count more than law, where dissent is tolerated only at the margins, and where public goods are treated as assets to be traded. It was a week in which the formal shell of democracy still stood, but the inner workings were bent further toward private gain and executive will. The changes were often technical. Their meaning was not.\
\
At the close of Week 6, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:27 p.m. By the end of Week 7, it read 8:34 p.m., a movement of just over seven minutes toward midnight. That shift reflects not a single break, but the accumulation of structural changes. Executive power moved further beyond effective oversight, as emergency authorities and impoundments were used to bypass Congress on arms sales and foreign aid. Law was used more openly as a weapon, not a limit, with prosecutions halted for allies and new barriers raised against those who might sue the government. The civil service was cut and reshaped on a scale that altered what the state can do and who it serves. Universities were told that funding and future careers depend on aligning with the administration\'92s line. Taken together, these moves narrowed the space for independent judgment and deepened the fusion of public office with private and partisan interests. That is why the clock advanced.\
\
The most visible front in this consolidation was the executive\'92s reach over money and force. The administration used emergency authorities to send billions in weapons to Israel while bypassing Congress, and approved a separate $3 billion arms sale without normal review. At the same time, it froze or impounded congressionally approved aid, including to Ukraine and other foreign programs, in defiance of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. Courts, including the Supreme Court, pushed back and ordered funds released, but the pattern was clear. The White House treated appropriations as suggestions rather than binding law. In foreign policy, this meant that the president and his circle could shift alliances and arm conflicts without the usual checks. At home, it signaled that the power of the purse, long a core legislative tool, was being tested and, where possible, overridden. The message was simple: where the executive could stretch its reach, it would.\
\
Emergency language became a routine tool rather than an exception. The president ordered investigations of timber and lumber imports under national security statutes, then used similar rationales to expand logging across 280 million acres of national forests and public lands. The orders directed agencies to speed approvals, bypassing the Endangered Species Act under vague emergency powers. Tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China were likewise framed as responses to drug flows and security threats, even as they were adjusted, suspended, and threatened again within days. The effect was to normalize a state of permanent crisis in which the executive could act quickly and alone, while the costs\'97in higher prices, environmental damage, and diplomatic strain\'97fell on the public. Emergency powers, once rare, became the default path for major policy. Crisis talk became a standing license to rule.\
\
Law enforcement and security institutions were drawn further into this orbit. The Defense Secretary ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt planning and operations against Russia, even as other officials insisted that Russian cyber threats remained serious. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was told to deprioritize Russian interference, including against U.S. elections. At the same time, nearly every federal law enforcement agency, along with the military, was mobilized for mass deportations, and a migrant family detention center in Texas was reopened. These moves shifted the focus of coercive power away from defending the public against foreign attacks and toward enforcing the administration\'92s immigration agenda. When Elon Musk publicly suggested pardoning Derek Chauvin, the officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, it underscored a broader message: some forms of state violence would be treated as worthy of clemency, while others\'97like peaceful protest or migration\'97would be met with force. The security state was being retuned to protect power, not people.\
\
The civil service, long a buffer between political whims and public service, came under sustained assault. Mass layoffs were initiated across agencies under the banner of the Department of Government Efficiency. The Social Security Administration announced plans to close regional offices and cut at least 7,000 jobs, with further staff reductions flagged in outside analyses. The Department of Veterans Affairs prepared to fire more than 80,000 employees, even as demand for veteran care rose. The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education faced similar reductions, with buyouts offered to staff ahead of a looming reduction in force. At the State Department, roughly 700 employees, including 450 career diplomats, had already resigned amid budget cuts and restructuring, and plans were drawn up to close consulates across Western Europe, Brazil, and Turkey. These changes were not just about headcount. They shifted the balance from a professional, relatively insulated civil service toward a smaller, more precarious workforce, easier to replace with political appointees or private contractors. Job security shrank. Leverage from above grew.\
\
Some oversight bodies pushed back, but their victories were partial and fragile. The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the temporary reinstatement of nearly 6,000 probationary employees at the Department of Agriculture, finding likely legal violations in their mass firing. A federal judge blocked the administration from firing the head of the Office of Special Counsel, preserving a key whistleblower-protection role. Another court halted drastic cuts to medical research funding, and yet another ordered a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official to testify about whether the agency was actually fulfilling its statutory duties after nearly all staff were placed on indefinite leave. These rulings showed that legal tools still existed to defend the civil service and public-interest agencies. They also revealed how much energy now had to be spent simply to keep basic functions alive, rather than to improve them. The system was fighting to stand still.\
\
While the formal structures strained, appointments and patronage filled the gaps. The Senate confirmed Linda McMahon, a long-time Trump ally and former wrestling executive, as Secretary of Education, even as leaked drafts and internal plans showed the administration preparing to dismantle the department she would lead. At the Inter-American Foundation, the White House fired the president and CEO, dissolved the bipartisan board, and installed a loyalist, Peter Marocco, as sole board member and chair. Most staff were placed on paid leave, and the agency\'92s website was taken offline. In the financial realm, David Sacks, appointed as a crypto czar, helped design a \'93Crypto Strategic Reserve\'94 and a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that would hold specific digital assets\'97Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano\'97tied to companies and investors with close ties to the administration. These moves concentrated control over education, foreign aid, and emerging financial policy in the hands of loyalists whose fortunes were often intertwined with the sectors they now oversaw. Office and opportunity flowed to those closest to power.\
\
The line between public policy and private enrichment blurred further in the handling of financial crime and regulation. The Treasury Department announced it would not enforce a Biden-era rule aimed at preventing money laundering and shell companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created after the 2008 crisis to police abuses in consumer finance, was effectively shut down when nearly all employees were placed on indefinite administrative leave and instructed, via internal emails, to ignore legally mandated supervision and examination work. In a separate case, the administration halted the fraud prosecution of Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto magnate who had purchased large amounts of Trump-branded memecoins, boosting their value and the president\'92s personal wealth. Taken together, these actions signaled that allies in the financial sector could expect leniency and that the tools meant to police corruption and abuse would be turned off or redirected. The law still existed on paper. Its bite was reserved.\
\
At the same time, the administration moved aggressively into the cryptocurrency markets with public funds. On social media and through formal executive orders, the president announced the creation of a national crypto reserve and a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to be stocked with specific tokens. The orders directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to find ways to acquire more of these assets, including through forfeiture proceedings, while maintaining \'93budget neutrality.\'94 Critics pointed out that the chosen currencies aligned closely with the holdings and investments of insiders, including Ripple, which had donated millions to Trump\'92s inauguration and pro-crypto political committees. The effect was to use the state\'92s balance sheet to support and legitimize a volatile market in which the president\'92s allies stood to gain, while ordinary taxpayers bore the risk. Public risk and private reward moved in lockstep.\
\
Economic policy more broadly was wielded as a blunt instrument. The administration imposed historic 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and doubled tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. These moves were justified as protecting American workers and combating drug flows, but they quickly triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada, China, and Mexico. Canadian and Chinese measures hit U.S. farm products and manufactured goods, while a Norwegian fuel company announced it would stop selling fuel to U.S. entities in Norway in protest of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Analysts warned of price increases on cars, fuel, and consumer goods, and the Atlanta Federal Reserve revised its forecast from growth to a 2.8% annualized contraction. Stock indices fell, and manufacturing indices signaled stagnation. The administration responded by partially suspending tariffs on auto parts and other goods, then pausing tariffs under the USMCA framework until April, only to threaten new measures again. The pattern was one of deliberate volatility: trade policy as a lever for political theater and pressure, with the costs diffused across the economy. Stability became a casualty of spectacle.\
\
As these economic shocks rippled outward, the administration also hollowed out the information needed to understand them. The Department of Education\'92s research arm lost nearly $1 billion in funding, canceling contracts that maintained national data on student demographics and achievement. Without those numbers, it becomes harder to track which students are falling behind and why. The Social Security Administration banned employees from accessing news websites on work devices, limiting their ability to consult external reporting and analysis. There were accusations that the administration might manipulate federal economic statistics to obscure the damage from tariffs. And the White House delayed release of a high-profile report on Jeffrey Epstein, while the president requested that the Declaration of Independence be moved into the Oval Office. These acts, varied as they were, shared a theme: control over what the public can see and remember. Knowledge itself became a contested resource.\
\
Universities, long treated as semi-autonomous spaces for debate and research, were brought under direct pressure. The interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia sent a letter to Georgetown Law\'92s dean demanding an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, warning that his office would not hire graduates from institutions that continued such programs. The Department of Justice opened a Title VII investigation into the University of California system over alleged antisemitism linked to Gaza protests, raising complex questions about the line between discrimination and political expression. The administration cut off $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing its handling of antisemitism, and the president threatened to halt federal funding to any college that allowed \'93illegal protests,\'94 while promising to expel or arrest student \'93agitators.\'94 These moves did not yet amount to a formal censorship regime, but they used hiring, investigations, and funding to push universities toward self-censorship and to signal that certain lines of inquiry and protest would carry institutional costs. Academic freedom was left standing, but under warning.\
\
The week also saw a tightening of control over who belongs and on what terms. An executive order designated English as the official language of the United States and revoked a Clinton-era order that had required language assistance for people with limited English proficiency. While the new order did not immediately ban services in other languages, it removed a federal obligation to provide them, making access to government services more dependent on English fluency. Immigration enforcement intensified: a German tourist was held for over a month in detention, including eight days in solitary confinement, after being accused of intending to work illegally despite having proper travel documents. The administration prepared to deport roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who had fled Russia\'92s invasion and held temporary legal status, then partially walked back the plan under public pressure. It also considered a new travel ban targeting countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, echoing the first-term Muslim ban. In Central America, U.S. officials threatened to reclaim the Panama Canal or impose tariffs to force governments to accept U.S. migration demands. These policies stratified rights and protections by nationality, language, and perceived ideology. Citizenship became a sliding scale, not a shared floor.\
\
Inside the country, dissent was increasingly framed as disorder or disloyalty. During the president\'92s address to Congress, Representative Al Green repeatedly protested claims of an electoral mandate and was removed from the chamber at the Speaker\'92s direction. Days later, the House voted to censure him, with some Democrats joining Republicans, and proposals circulated to strip him of committee assignments. The president\'92s speech itself, delivered as a campaign-style rally, was filled with false claims about Ukraine aid, Social Security, and immigration, and Democrats who objected were portrayed as obstructing the will of the people. Outside the Capitol, the president threatened to cut funding to colleges that allowed protests and to expel students who participated. In this framing, opposition was not a normal part of democratic life but a breach of order, to be punished through institutional means. The right to disagree was recast as a problem to be managed.\
\
Yet resistance did not vanish. Thousands protested an anti-trans bill in Iowa that would strip civil-rights protections from transgender people. In Montana, a coalition of Republicans and Democrats defeated two extreme anti-trans bills, one that would have banned drag shows and Pride marches, and another that would have allowed the state to remove transgender children from their parents. Bishop William Barber prepared a march from a church to the Supreme Court, calling for moral resistance to injustice and corruption. European leaders gathered in London to reaffirm support for Ukraine after a contentious Oval Office meeting in which the president and vice president had pressured Volodymyr Zelensky to accept terms favorable to Russia. Courts across the country issued rulings that checked some of the administration\'92s moves, from blocking illegal firings to preserving foreign aid and medical research funding. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s overall drift, but they showed that other centers of power and conscience remained active. The contest over the country\'92s direction was still live.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 7, several processes were already in motion. Votes on the SAVE Act, with its potential to disenfranchise millions, were scheduled in both chambers of Congress. The Government Accountability Office had been asked to investigate mass federal firings and the role of private contractors in filling the gaps. Courts were set to hear further arguments on abortion travel prosecutions, CFPB operations, and the limits of executive impoundment. The Federal Election Commission planned a closed meeting on enforcement matters, while the Election Assistance Commission sought public comment on the national mail voter registration form. Internationally, the administration was drawing up plans to lift sanctions on Russia and restore economic ties, even as allies considered withholding intelligence from the United States out of fear that it might be shared with Moscow. These were not hypothetical risks. They were live files on desks and dockets.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'978:34 p.m.\'97captured a system still functioning but under heavier strain. The week mattered because it showed how many levers could be pulled at once: emergency powers, trade policy, personnel decisions, funding streams, and symbolic acts like renaming a wildlife refuge or moving a founding document. Each lever on its own might have seemed reversible. Together they formed a pattern of governance that treats law as an instrument, not a boundary; that treats public offices as prizes for allies; and that treats truth and memory as assets to be managed. The moral floor, already cracked, bore deeper fractures in ethics, restraint, truthfulness, and stewardship. Character and good faith, while not yet shattered, showed worrying signs of erosion. At 8:34 p.m., there was still time on the clock. But the week\'92s events made clear that the distance to midnight is not measured only in crises. It is measured in the quiet, cumulative choices that decide whether power serves the public, or the other way around.\
\
## Week 7 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Donald Trump ordered closure of the 18F office that built IRS Direct File as part of a federal workforce reduction (2025-03-01): Shuttering 18F and firing its staff reduced in\uc0\u8209 house federal digital capacity and shifted power away from public technologists toward political appointees and contractors, weakening the state\'92s ability to deliver and oversee core services.\
\
2. President Donald Trump issued an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States and revoking prior language access guidance (2025-03-01): Making English the official federal language and rescinding language\uc0\u8209 access rules narrowed practical access to government for non\u8209 English speakers, entrenching a hierarchy of belonging tied to language and national origin.\
\
3. President Donald Trump directed investigations and expansion of American timber production through executive orders (2025-03-01): Using executive authority to expand logging and probe timber imports shifted environmental and land\uc0\u8209 use decisions into the president\'92s hands, weakening expert\u8209 driven safeguards and empowering resource\u8209 extraction interests.\
\
4. Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency authorities to send $4 billion in arms to Israel without normal congressional review (2025-03-01): Bypassing Congress on a large weapons transfer concentrated war\uc0\u8209 making discretion in the executive branch and eroded legislative oversight of foreign military commitments.\
\
5. Representative Eli Crane filed articles of impeachment against Judge Paul Engelmayer after his ruling against a Trump administration department (2025-03-01): Targeting a judge for an adverse policy ruling used impeachment as a political weapon, pressuring the judiciary to align with executive preferences rather than independent legal judgment.\
\
6. Elon Musk urged congressional Republicans to impeach federal judges who ruled against the Department of Government Efficiency (2025-03-01): A powerful private actor calling for impeachment of disfavored judges highlighted how wealth and influence can be mobilized to intimidate courts and reshape them around regime priorities.\
\
7. President Donald Trump amended tariff rules at the northern and southern borders via executive orders framed as anti\uc0\u8209 drug measures (2025-03-02): Adjusting de minimis and duty rules by decree further normalized use of trade powers as unilateral executive tools, with limited legislative input on their economic and social consequences.\
\
8. President Donald Trump announced creation of a federal strategic cryptocurrency reserve and digital asset stockpile (2025-03-02): Centralizing decisions over a government crypto reserve in the presidency opened space for opaque asset selection and potential self\uc0\u8209 dealing, weakening transparent, rules\u8209 based financial governance.\
\
9. President Donald Trump approved a nearly $3 billion arms sale to Israel while bypassing congressional review (2025-03-02): Authorizing a major arms package without normal legislative scrutiny concentrated foreign\uc0\u8209 policy power in the executive and sidelined Congress on a consequential conflict decision.\
\
10. President Donald Trump froze and then was ordered to release congressionally approved foreign aid through executive actions later blocked by courts (2025-03-04): Attempting to unilaterally impound billions in foreign aid challenged Congress\'92s power of the purse, forcing courts to intervene to preserve basic separation of powers.\
\
11. President Donald Trump ordered mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies including IRS, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, Education, and others (2025-03-04): Coordinated reductions in force across key agencies restructured the civil service toward a smaller, more politically dependent workforce, weakening institutional continuity and nonpartisan capacity.\
\
12. President Donald Trump issued executive orders suspending or altering security clearances and federal dealings with Perkins Coie LLP (2025-03-06): Targeting a specific law firm that had represented political opponents used security and contracting powers to punish perceived enemies, blurring lines between state authority and partisan retaliation.\
\
13. President Donald Trump signed a memo urging agencies to require upfront fees from people suing the administration (2025-03-06): Pushing agencies to demand upfront payments from litigants raised financial barriers to challenging government actions, weakening access to courts as a check on executive power.\
\
14. President Donald Trump announced plans to deport approximately 240,000 Ukrainians with temporary legal status before later walking back the move (2025-03-05): Threatening mass removal of legally present Ukrainians used immigration status as leverage in foreign policy, signaling that humanitarian protections can be revoked at executive whim.\
\
15. President Donald Trump signed an executive order revising Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility to exclude organizations engaged in activities deemed illegal or contrary to administration priorities (2025-03-07): Redefining which public\uc0\u8209 service employers qualify for loan forgiveness allowed the executive to financially pressure disfavored nonprofits, including immigration and civil\u8209 rights groups, by threatening their workers\'92 benefits.\
\
16. President Donald Trump threatened to halt federal funding to educational institutions that allow what he called illegal protests and to expel or arrest student agitators (2025-03-04): Linking campus funding and student status to suppression of protest framed dissent as unlawful and used fiscal leverage to chill political expression in key civic spaces.\
\
17. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing newly announced USMCA tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2 (2025-03-07): Rapidly imposing and then pausing tariffs by decree underscored how major trade levers were being used as personal bargaining tools, creating volatility that weakens predictable, rules\uc0\u8209 based economic governance.\
\
18. President Donald Trump requested that the Declaration of Independence be moved to the Oval Office (2025-03-06): Seeking physical control over a foundational national document symbolically personalized state heritage and raised concerns about stewardship of shared civic artifacts.\
\
19. President Donald Trump told cabinet secretaries they, not Elon Musk, were in charge of their departments amid concerns about Musk\'92s influence (2025-03-07): The need to clarify that formal appointees, not an outside billionaire adviser, controlled agencies highlighted blurred lines between official authority and private influence in executive decision\uc0\u8209 making.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Naval Criminal Investigative Service reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence were targeting recently fired U.S. federal employees for recruitment (2025-03-01): Foreign services seeking to recruit laid\uc0\u8209 off officials with clearances showed how abrupt purges can weaken institutional security and create vulnerabilities in the federal workforce.\
\
2. House of Representatives passed a budget resolution launching reconciliation to extend Trump\uc0\u8209 era tax cuts and cut safety\u8209 net programs (2025-03-02): Using budget procedure to lock in tax cuts for the wealthy while cutting Medicaid and other supports illustrated how fiscal rules can entrench inequality through ordinary legislative channels.\
\
3. Election Assistance Commission sought public comments on the National Mail Voter Registration Form (2025-03-04): Reviewing the national mail registration form through notice\uc0\u8209 and\u8209 comment preserved a transparent process for how citizens sign up to vote, supporting administrative integrity in election access.\
\
4. Federal Election Commission scheduled a closed Sunshine Act meeting to address compliance and civil matters (2025-03-06): Holding a closed enforcement meeting under Sunshine Act exceptions balanced confidentiality in investigations with limited public visibility into how campaign\uc0\u8209 finance rules are applied.\
\
5. Congressional Budget Office reported that House Republicans\'92 budget instructions would require large Medicaid cuts to meet targets (2025-03-05): Nonpartisan scoring showed that proposed deficit reductions effectively demanded deep health\uc0\u8209 care cuts, clarifying the real distributional stakes of budget choices for lawmakers and the public.\
\
6. Senate of the United States confirmed Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education despite her limited education background (2025-03-03): Confirming a loyalist with little subject expertise to lead an agency the president aims to dismantle illustrated how appointments can be used to weaken institutions from within.\
\
7. White House and Department of Veterans Affairs leadership planned to fire roughly 80,000\'9683,000 VA employees as part of efficiency measures (2025-03-06): Proposed mass VA layoffs threatened the agency\'92s capacity to deliver earned benefits, signaling a shift from public provision toward potential privatization of core veteran services.\
\
8. White House installed Peter Marocco as sole board member and head of the Inter\uc0\u8209 American Foundation while placing most staff on leave (2025-03-04): Concentrating control of a congressionally created foreign\u8209 aid agency in a single loyalist and sidelining its staff undermined its independence and normal board governance.\
\
9. Merit Systems Protection Board ordered temporary reinstatement of nearly 6,000 fired USDA probationary employees (2025-03-05): Reinstating mass\uc0\u8209 terminated agriculture staff for 45 days signaled that independent civil\u8209 service protections still constrained politically driven purges, at least procedurally.\
\
10. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House of Representatives ordered removal and later censure of Representative Al Green for disrupting Trump\'92s address (2025-03-06): Ejecting and censuring a member for vocal protest during a presidential speech enforced strict decorum rules that can be used to marginalize dissenting voices inside the legislature.\
\
11. Senator Elizabeth Warren and ten other Democratic senators requested a GAO investigation into mass firings of federal probationary employees (2025-03-06): Calling for GAO review of large\uc0\u8209 scale dismissals sought to reassert congressional oversight over executive workforce restructuring and its impact on public safety and privatization.\
\
12. Republican congressional leadership ended a congressional investigation into oil and gas industry disinformation after gaining control of both chambers (2025-03-06): Shutting down a probe into fossil\uc0\u8209 fuel misinformation reduced institutional scrutiny of a powerful industry\'92s role in shaping climate policy and public understanding.\
\
13. Federal courts and Supreme Court of the United States repeatedly ruled that Trump\'92s firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox was illegal and ordered her reinstated (2025-03-06): Courts holding that the president could not summarily remove an NLRB member reaffirmed statutory limits on executive interference with independent labor adjudication.\
\
14. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered CFPB chief operating officer Adam Martinez to testify in an evidentiary hearing over alleged false declarations (2025-03-04): Compelling a senior CFPB official to explain conflicting statements about the agency\'92s operations reinforced judicial oversight of whether regulators are meeting their statutory duties.\
\
15. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leadership under Russell Vought placed nearly all CFPB staff on indefinite administrative leave and instructed them to ignore certain legal mandates (2025-03-04): Effectively sidelining the CFPB workforce and telling staff to disregard required supervision hollowed out a key consumer watchdog, weakening enforcement of financial protections.\
\
16. American Bar Association issued a statement condemning intimidation of judges by Trump and his allies (2025-03-03): The ABA\'92s public defense of judicial independence signaled professional resistance to political attacks on courts, even as formal protections remained contested.\
\
17. Representative Mike Johnson removed Representative Mike Turner from the House Intelligence Committee after he contradicted administration claims on Russia cyber threats (2025-03-03): Ousting the Intelligence Committee chair for publicly challenging the administration\'92s Russia posture weakened independent congressional oversight of national\uc0\u8209 security policy.\
\
18. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leadership reversed prior firings of 180 employees and instructed them to return to work (2025-03-05): Reinstating previously terminated CDC staff partially corrected an earlier disruptive workforce decision, helping stabilize a key public\uc0\u8209 health institution.\
\
19. Supreme Court of the United States denied as moot the government\'92s emergency application in Bessent v. Dellinger over firing the Special Counsel (2025-03-06): By declining to vacate a lower\uc0\u8209 court stay in a dispute over removal of the Special Counsel, the Court left unresolved but visible the legal limits on dismissing independent watchdogs.\
\
20. Federal Communications Commission adopted the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric as the core data source for high\uc0\u8209 cost deployment obligations (2025-03-05): Standardizing broadband deployment data aimed to improve accountability for subsidy recipients and ensure public funds expand service where promised.\
\
21. Federal Communications Commission advanced multiple information\uc0\u8209 collection reviews and rulemakings affecting emergency alerts, spectrum, telehealth, schools, and IoT labeling (2025-03-04): Ongoing FCC paperwork and data\u8209 collection reviews shaped how communications providers report compliance and how programs like E\u8209 Rate and telehealth are administered, influencing transparency and service delivery.\
\
22. Environmental Protection Agency took multiple Superfund and hazardous\uc0\u8209 waste actions including site deletions, settlements, and advisory board nominations (2025-03-03): Routine EPA cleanup settlements, NPL deletions, and advisory board recruitment maintained environmental enforcement structures and opportunities for public input on hazardous\u8209 waste oversight.\
\
23. Drug Enforcement Administration announced several applications for controlled\uc0\u8209 substance importer registrations for pharmaceutical uses (2025-03-06): DEA\'92s public notice and comment process for importing controlled substances for research and manufacturing reflected ongoing regulatory checks on drug supply chains.\
\
24. Food and Drug Administration denied a hearing request and refused approval of a supplemental new drug application for HETLIOZ (2025-03-07): Rejecting a sleep\uc0\u8209 disorder drug expansion for lack of evidence showed the FDA continuing to apply scientific standards in drug approvals despite political turbulence elsewhere.\
\
25. Federal Communications Commission expanded unlicensed use of the 6 GHz band and allocated spectrum for non\uc0\u8209 federal space launch operations and tribal radio service (2025-03-06): Spectrum decisions for Wi\u8209 Fi, space launches, and tribal radio shaped who can access and benefit from key communications resources, with implications for competition and local voice.\
\
\
### Economic Structure\
\
1. President Donald Trump imposed and then adjusted sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, prompting foreign retaliation (2025-03-04): Aggressive, rapidly shifting tariffs and counter\uc0\u8209 tariffs disrupted trade flows, raised consumer prices, and injected uncertainty into the economy, illustrating how executive trade policy can redistribute costs without broad consent.\
\
2. Department of Government Efficiency and Department of Education leadership canceled roughly $900 million in education research funding and cut nearly $1 billion from the department budget (2025-03-03): Slashing education research and data capacity weakened evidence\uc0\u8209 based policymaking and shifted power toward ideological or market\u8209 driven decisions about schooling.\
\
3. State Street Corporation ended board diversity requirements and disclosure expectations for companies in its index funds (2025-03-04): Rolling back diversity conditions for portfolio companies signaled retreat from using investor power to promote inclusive governance, reinforcing traditional corporate hierarchies.\
