\
By the fifth week of this term, the pattern hinted at in earlier days came into full view. What had looked like scattered blows against agencies, courts, and norms resolved into something more coherent: a governing project that treats the state as a thing to be seized, stripped, and repurposed, rather than a trust to be tended. The week\'92s events were not just noisy. They were coordinated. Executive orders, mass firings, politicized prosecutions, and information controls all moved in the same direction, tightening the circle around power and hollowing out the institutions that might resist it. The result was a shift not only in policy but in the character of public life, where loyalty counted for more than law and truth was something to be managed, not honored.\
\
At the start of this period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:07 p.m. By the end, it read 8:16 p.m., an advance of 8.4 minutes. That is a large move for a single week this early in the term, and it reflects how many of the system\'92s core traits shifted at once. Executive power operating without effective oversight ticked upward as the White House defied court orders, centralized control over independent regulators, and used a private ally to drive mass purges of the civil service. Law as a weapon, not a limit, grew more present as the Justice Department dropped corruption cases for political reasons and cleared out prosecutors who refused. Transparency weakened as press access was cut off and government data was pulled toward partisan hands. Labor protections eroded under the weight of mass firings and budget blueprints that treated workers and the poor as expendable. Surveillance of ordinary citizens expanded, even as elite misconduct was shielded. The clock\'92s movement captures that convergence: not a single spectacular breach, but a week in which the walls of accountability moved inward on many sides at once.\
\
The spine of the week was the assault on the civil service itself. Through a cluster of orders and directives, the administration turned what had been a professional, if imperfect, bureaucracy into a field for political cleansing and private experimentation. An executive order on February 11 put Elon Musk in charge of a \'93workforce optimization initiative,\'94 and agencies responded by firing thousands of employees. The Forest Service prepared to terminate 3,400 recent hires, the National Park Service another thousand, even as wildfires and visitor numbers rose. NIH and CDC braced for the loss of 1,500 scientists and public health staff. At land agencies, thousands more were dismissed, including those responsible for wildfire response and emergency management. These were not targeted cuts after careful review; they were broad sweeps aimed at probationary workers and entire program offices, carried out under the banner of efficiency but timed to maximize executive leverage and minimize internal resistance.\
\
The human cost of those decisions was immediate, but the democratic cost lay in what they did to capacity and independence. Agencies that manage public lands, fight fires, track disease, and administer benefits are the state\'92s hands and nerves. When they are gutted, the public loses not just services but the ability to see and respond to danger. In this week, that loss was sharpened by mismanagement that bordered on farce. The USDA \'93accidentally\'94 fired key staff working on the H5N1 bird flu outbreak and then scrambled to rehire them. The FAA dismissed hundreds of employees responsible for air traffic control systems. Workers administering the CHIPS Act, meant to secure the semiconductor supply chain, were laid off. These were not random errors. They were the predictable outcome of a purge carried out at speed, with little regard for function, and overseen by a private billionaire whose own companies were under regulatory review.\
\
Resistance did appear, but it was thin and fragile. Five federal employees\'92 unions sued, arguing that the mass firings violated established procedures for reductions in force and would cripple already understaffed agencies. A federal judge, Tanya Chutkan, pressed the Justice Department on whether it even knew the scale of the firings, suggesting a willful ignorance at the top of the legal system. Yet when unions sought an injunction, another judge, Christopher Cooper, ruled that the courts lacked jurisdiction and directed them to the labor board instead. That decision, echoed in a second ruling at week\'92s end, allowed the layoffs to proceed while the slow machinery of administrative complaints ground forward. The law, in effect, stepped aside, and the executive\'92s hand remained free.\
\
If the civil service was one front, the justice system was another. The week saw a series of moves that turned the Department of Justice from a guardian of law into an instrument of favor and fear. At the center was the corruption case against New York City mayor Eric Adams. Acting U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon resigned after being pressured to drop the charges in exchange for Adams\'92s cooperation with immigration enforcement. At least five lawyers from the Public Integrity Section followed her out the door, describing the choice they were given\'97dismiss the case in an hour or be fired\'97as \'93gut-wrenching.\'94 Despite those resignations, the acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, and the department ordered the bribery charges dropped. A federal judge in Manhattan questioned the rationale, probing whether the dismissal was a quid pro quo for Adams\'92s alignment with Trump\'92s policies, and ordered an evidentiary hearing. But the message to prosecutors was clear: cases against politically useful figures would not be allowed to stand.\
\
The pattern extended beyond New York. The administration had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the inspector general for USAID after critical reports. It now sought Supreme Court approval to remove Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, despite a lower court order reinstating him. That office protects whistleblowers across the federal government; weakening it removes one of the last internal checks on abuse. Denise Cheung, a senior DOJ official in Washington, resigned rather than pursue an asset freeze on a Biden-era contract she believed had no legal basis. More than 900 former federal prosecutors signed an open letter urging current DOJ lawyers to uphold their oaths and resist unethical orders. These acts of conscience mattered, but they were defensive, not decisive. At the same time, the president pardoned a convicted former governor, Rod Blagojevich, and nominated Ed Martin\'97a \'93Stop the Steal\'94 figure who had already overseen the dismissal of January 6 cases\'97as permanent U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The Senate confirmation of Kash Patel, a loyalist who had published lists of supposed \'93deep state\'94 enemies, as FBI director completed the picture: law enforcement leadership was being staffed for loyalty, not independence.\
\
In this context, the law became less a boundary and more a weapon. The Justice Department\'92s decision to drop the Adams case, the firing of Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys en masse, and the pressure on prosecutors to target political opponents all fit a single pattern: crimes by allies were softened or erased, while the machinery of investigation was turned toward critics. Operation Whirlwind, announced by Ed Martin to prosecute threats against officials, quickly focused on statements by senators who had criticized Musk\'92s DOGE team. Tom Homan suggested that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should be arrested for obstruction of justice for advising immigrants of their rights. These were not yet mass arrests of opposition figures, but they were steps toward treating dissent as criminal and loyalty as exculpatory. The trait that tracks law as a limit gave way to one that tracks law as a tool.\
\
Alongside these domestic moves, the administration worked to pull independent regulators into the president\'92s orbit. An executive order titled \'93Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies\'94 required independent bodies to submit their rules to the White House\'92s regulatory office for review. Another order made agencies like the SEC and FTC report their priorities and budgets to the White House, eroding the arm\'92s-length design that had been built to insulate markets and consumers from direct political pressure. A separate order, framed as \'93lawful governance,\'94 instructed agencies to review and rescind regulations deemed unconstitutional or burdensome, effectively inviting political appointees to rewrite the regulatory state in line with the president\'92s preferences. These moves did not abolish the agencies; they bent them. Combined with the workforce purge and the outsourcing of key functions to Musk\'92s DOGE, they shifted the balance from rule-bound administration to personalized control.\
\
Information, too, was pulled closer to the center. The Associated Press was banned from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and executive briefing rooms after refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the \'93Gulf of America.\'94 The White House deputy chief of staff announced that AP would be barred from coverage, and the State Department ordered its posts around the world to cancel \'93non-mission critical\'94 media subscriptions. Embassies that rely on local news to assess security risks and political shifts were told to justify any remaining subscriptions. These were not budgetary footnotes; they were deliberate constraints on what officials could see and what the public could learn. The AP responded with a lawsuit, arguing that the ban violated press freedoms, but in the meantime, the administration had signaled that access to information was contingent on compliance with its narrative.\
\
At the same time, the administration sought to expand its reach into the most sensitive government databases. The IRS reviewed a request to give a DOGE official access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which holds detailed taxpayer records. DOGE pushed to tap into Social Security databases containing income and medical information for tens of millions of Americans. Michelle King, the acting head of the Social Security Administration, resigned rather than grant that access. Employees at the General Services Administration quit after a Musk ally demanded administrative control over a system that allows the government to text the public. Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren demanded answers from the IRS, warning that Musk and his associates might weaponize government data for political targeting. Yet a White House spokesperson defended DOGE\'92s access as necessary to root out fraud, even as independent reporting showed that its claims of massive savings were unsubstantiated. The trait that tracks surveillance of ordinary citizens moved closer to midnight: more eyes on the public, fewer checks on those who hold the data.\
\
The same impulse to control memory and narrative appeared in the cultural and educational sphere. The Defense Department\'92s school system ordered teachers to strip curricula of \'93gender ideology\'94 and \'93discriminatory equity ideology,\'94 which in practice meant removing lessons on Black History Month, immigration, and even a biography of a transgender Civil War soldier. Librarians were told to pull books on gender and equity, including works on Appalachian poverty and Indigenous history, with little guidance beyond the ideological labels. OSHA ordered the destruction of 18 workplace safety publications as part of a botched purge of diversity and inclusion materials, even though most of the targeted documents were not about diversity at all. The National Park Service removed references to transgender people from its websites. Federal sites scrubbed mentions of Black Americans during Black History Month. At Stonewall National Monument, \'93TQ+\'94 was dropped from the LGBTQ+ designation, prompting protests in Christopher Park. These were small edits in code and text, but together they marked a state that was curating which histories and identities could appear in its official story.\
\
Symbolic gestures reinforced that project. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth restored the name Fort Bragg to a North Carolina base, reversing efforts to move away from honoring Confederate leaders. The president signed a proclamation declaring \'93Gulf of America Day\'94 while flying over the Gulf of Mexico, insisting on a new name that news outlets were expected to adopt. An earlier executive order mandated the release of Martin Luther King Jr. assassination records without giving his family a chance to review them, raising fears that old smears would be revived under the guise of transparency. Representative Claudia Tenney introduced a bill to make Trump\'92s birthday a national holiday. The president posted that \'93He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\'94 and likened himself to Napoleon. These acts did not change statutes, but they worked on the moral floor: they taught that power could rename, reframe, and excuse itself, and that history was something to be bent toward the leader\'92s image.\
\
The week\'92s foreign policy developments showed the same disregard for shared norms, now projected outward. In Brussels and Munich, Defense Secretary Hegseth and Vice President J.D. Vance announced that Europe was no longer America\'92s primary security focus, that Ukraine would not regain all its territory, and that its NATO membership was off the table. Vance met with the leader of Germany\'92s far-right AfD instead of the chancellor and denounced secular democracy. In Riyadh, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to restaff embassies and began peace talks over Ukraine without Ukrainian or European participation. Reports indicated that Trump blamed Ukraine for the war, demanded that President Zelensky hold elections in wartime, and offered a peace plan that recognized Russian territorial claims. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proposed U.S. support in exchange for half of Ukraine\'92s mineral resources. A White House official pressed Ukraine to stop criticizing Trump and accept a minerals deal, warning that refusal would be \'93unacceptable.\'94 By week\'92s end, the national security adviser said Zelensky was expected to sign such an agreement soon.\
\
These moves did more than unsettle allies. They signaled a shift in how the United States understood its own role: from steward of a rules-based order to a transactional power willing to trade another country\'92s sovereignty for resources and a photo opportunity. Congress had, in an earlier year, passed a law requiring Senate approval for any withdrawal from NATO, a reminder that some guardrails remained. European leaders convened emergency meetings, declared states of emergency to support Ukraine, and began planning for a world in which U.S. commitments could no longer be assumed. But the administration\'92s alignment with Russian narratives, its willingness to blame Ukraine, and its flirtation with Chinese troops policing a ceasefire all pushed the trait that tracks global democracy and alliances toward a darker place.\
\
At home, the same calculus appeared in domestic policy. The House Budget Committee\'92s proposal for $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs, paired with extended tax cuts for the wealthy, was endorsed by the president and echoed in administration plans to cut Social Security and food assistance. A separate House resolution demanded $880 billion in cuts from the Energy and Commerce Committee, raising the specter of deep Medicaid reductions. The administration froze funding for electric vehicle subsidies, canceled policies favoring battery-powered cars, and fired staff administering the CHIPS Act. It moved to fast-track fossil fuel projects through \'93emergency\'94 permits that bypassed environmental review and public comment for hundreds of pipelines and drilling applications. Climate advocacy groups sued to restore protections for millions of acres of federal waters. These were not just policy disagreements. They were choices that shifted risk and cost onto the public while preserving profit and flexibility for those closest to power.\
\
Against this backdrop, there were pockets of civic resistance and institutional resilience. Protesters marched in Denver on Presidents Day, in front of the SpaceX building in Washington, and across the country against Musk\'92s cuts and the administration\'92s agenda. Rallies in North Carolina defended a state justice under political attack. The 50501 Movement issued a statement renouncing violence and weapons at its events, insisting on peaceful advocacy. The Principles First summit gathered anti-Trump conservatives to reaffirm democratic values. Courts blocked the administration\'92s attempt to end birthright citizenship, protected transgender youth\'92s access to health care, and ordered the restoration of frozen foreign aid and NIH funding. A Missouri judge struck down discriminatory licensing rules that had effectively banned abortion providers, enforcing a state constitutional amendment. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s damage, but they showed that the civic covenant was not entirely broken, that some actors still understood restraint, truthfulness, and stewardship as obligations rather than options.\
\
Yet the weight of the week lay on the other side of the scale. Executive power grew more insulated from oversight as watchdogs were fired, independent agencies were pulled under White House control, and courts were told they had no jurisdiction over mass firings. Law was bent toward the protection of allies and the intimidation of critics. Wealth and loyalty bought not just access but outcomes: pardons, dropped cases, and favorable appointments. Surveillance and data access expanded in ways that made ordinary citizens more legible to power while leaving elite misconduct opaque. Education and culture were scrubbed and rewritten to erase dissenting histories and marginalized identities. Abroad, alliances were strained and adversaries courted in ways that undercut democratic partners.\
\
That is why the Democracy Clock moved as it did. An 8.4-minute advance at this stage does not mean collapse is imminent, but it does mean that the space for repair is shrinking. Each trait that shifted\'97civil service politicized, labor protections eroded, executive oversight weakened, law weaponized, transparency dimmed, memory curated by power\'97represents a piece of the democratic architecture made more fragile. The moral floor, too, sagged under the weight of the week: character reduced to self-justification, ethics treated as obstacles, restraint abandoned in favor of dominance, truthfulness sacrificed to narrative control, good faith replaced by suspicion, stewardship traded for short-term gain.\
\
At the close of this period, the official time stands at 8:16 p.m. The hour is still early enough that institutions can be rebuilt and norms restored, but late enough that each additional breach carries more risk. This week shows, more than any single headline, how quickly a democracy can be weakened when power is used not as a trust but as a weapon, and how much work will be required\'97by courts, by legislators, by civil servants, and by citizens\'97to push the hands of the clock back toward safety.\
\
## Week 5 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump signed an order empowering Elon Musk\'92s DOGE committee to shrink the federal workforce (2025-02-11): By delegating sweeping workforce reduction authority to an unelected DOGE committee, the president shifted core personnel power away from normal civil-service channels and oversight, weakening constraints on executive control over the bureaucracy.\
\
2. President Trump implemented and defended an illegal federal spending freeze (2025-02-16): Freezing congressionally appropriated federal spending in defiance of statutory requirements undermined legislative power of the purse and signaled willingness to ignore legal limits on executive budget control.\
\
3. President Trump announced and carried out mass firings of federal workers across agencies (2025-02-21): Large-scale dismissals of probationary federal employees, often without regard to performance or mission needs, concentrated personnel power in the presidency and weakened a politically neutral civil service.\
\
4. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to fire all remaining Biden-appointed US attorneys (2025-02-19): Directing the removal of all prior administration US attorneys aimed to align federal prosecutions with presidential preferences, eroding norms of prosecutorial independence.\
\
5. President Trump issued executive orders centralizing control over independent regulatory agencies (2025-02-18): Requiring independent regulators to route rules and priorities through the White House and OIRA expanded presidential supervision over bodies designed to be insulated from direct political control.\
\
6. President Trump issued a deregulatory executive order instructing agencies to rescind or ignore rules deemed unconstitutional (2025-02-19): Telling agencies to unilaterally deem regulations unconstitutional and de\uc0\u8209 prioritize enforcement let the executive reinterpret statutory limits, weakening legislative and judicial checks on regulatory policy.\
\
7. President Trump signed an order to reduce the federal bureaucracy and shrink or terminate several public entities (2025-02-19): Targeting public institutions like the US Institute of Peace and advisory committees for downsizing or elimination concentrated discretion over public goods in the executive and opened space for private or partisan control.\
\
8. President Trump ended federal benefits for undocumented immigrants through executive order (2025-02-20): Cutting access to unspecified federal benefits for undocumented residents used executive power to harden a tiered system of rights and entitlements based on immigration status.\
\
9. President Trump issued an order restricting federal funds to schools with COVID-19 vaccine mandates (2025-02-15): Conditioning education funding on dropping COVID-19 vaccine mandates leveraged federal spending to reshape local health and education policy, prioritizing parental and religious objections over public health guidance.\
\
10. President Trump threatened to cut federal funding to Maine over transgender sports policy (2025-02-21): Threatening a state\'92s funding to force compliance with a federal ban on transgender participation in women\'92s sports used fiscal coercion to override state policy choices on civil rights.\
\
11. President Trump publicly mused about running for a third presidential term (2025-02-20): Questioning the two\uc0\u8209 term limit and floating a third run normalized challenges to constitutional term limits that underpin peaceful rotation of power.\
\
12. Steve Bannon and CPAC allies promoted a constitutional change to allow Trump a third term (2025-02-20): Advocating amendment of presidential term limits to extend one leader\'92s tenure framed personal rule as a legitimate constitutional project, weakening norms of alternation in office.\
\
13. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to fire or reassign ICE leadership over deportation pace (2025-02-21): Removing and reshuffling ICE\'92s top officials to accelerate deportations tied law\uc0\u8209 enforcement leadership directly to presidential enforcement targets, narrowing space for professional judgment.\
\
14. President Trump fired Joint Chiefs chair CQ Brown Jr. and other top military officials (2025-02-21): Purging senior military leaders, including the first Black Joint Chiefs chair, over diversity and ideological disagreements risked politicizing the chain of command and weakening norms of nonpartisan military leadership.\
\
15. President Trump pardoned and celebrated January 6 Capitol attackers (2025-02-20): Granting clemency to and honoring individuals convicted for the Capitol attack signaled tolerance for political violence aligned with the president and undercut deterrence for future assaults on democratic institutions.\
\
16. President Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and declared Gulf of America Day (2025-02-09): Unilaterally renaming a major geographic feature and creating a commemorative day used symbolic power to recast national identity and pressured institutions and media to adopt politicized terminology.\
\
17. President Trump asserted authority to rename Denali and other federal designations by executive order (2025-02-13): Claiming unilateral power to change long\uc0\u8209 standing geographic names challenged legislative and local roles in managing national symbols and spurred congressional pushback.\
\
18. President Trump called for immediate closure of the Department of Education and prepared an order to abolish it (2025-02-16): Seeking to shutter the federal education department would dismantle a key national lever for equal educational opportunity and shift power over schooling away from a cabinet\uc0\u8209 level institution.\
\
19. President Trump planned to disband the USPS governing board and place the Postal Service under the Commerce Secretary (2025-02-20): Moving postal governance under a cabinet department and dissolving its board threatened the service\'92s quasi\uc0\u8209 independent status and increased executive leverage over a core civic infrastructure.\
\
20. President Trump issued an order ending taxpayer subsidization of so\uc0\u8209 called open borders (2025-02-19): Directing agencies to tighten eligibility and cut payments benefiting undocumented immigrants used executive discretion to harden exclusionary policies under the banner of fiscal integrity.\
\
21. President Trump signed an executive order expanding access to in vitro fertilization (2025-02-18): Ordering development of policies to reduce IVF costs and protect access modestly expanded reproductive options while also serving as a pronatalist signal amid broader reproductive rights conflicts.\
\
22. President Trump cut off and then reversed legal aid funding for unaccompanied immigrant children (2025-02-18): Briefly stripping legal representation from unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings exposed a vulnerable group to adjudication without counsel, highlighting executive leverage over access to justice.\
\
23. President Trump denied Georgia\'92s request to extend a disaster assistance deadline after Hurricane Helene (2025-02-15): Refusing to extend time for local governments to apply for federal disaster aid used discretionary authority in a way that could punish a state politically while slowing recovery.\
\
24. President Trump directed the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams (2025-02-17): Ordering dismissal of a high\uc0\u8209 profile corruption case in exchange for policy cooperation blurred the line between law enforcement and political bargaining, weakening the perception of equal justice.\
\
25. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to seek Supreme Court approval for firing whistleblower watchdog Hampton Dellinger (2025-02-17): Appealing to uphold dismissal of the Office of Special Counsel head challenged judicial protection for an independent whistleblower agency and strengthened presidential control over internal oversight.\
\
26. President Trump defied multiple federal court orders to halt or reverse executive actions and restore funding (2025-02-16): Continuing contested policies despite injunctions and orders to restore funding to agencies like NIH signaled open executive resistance to judicial authority and deepened a constitutional confrontation.\
\
27. President Trump announced an energy emergency and created fast-track permits for fossil fuel projects (2025-02-19): Invoking an energy emergency to expedite hundreds of fossil fuel permits allowed the executive to bypass standard environmental review and public input, weakening procedural safeguards.\
\
28. President Trump directed the State Department to cancel nonessential media subscriptions at diplomatic posts (2025-02-11): Ordering embassies and consulates to drop most news subscriptions constrained diplomats\'92 access to independent information, increasing reliance on centrally approved sources.\
\
29. President Trump banned Associated Press journalists from White House and presidential travel (2025-02-16): Excluding a major wire service from briefings, the Oval Office, and Air Force One over a naming dispute punished independent editorial judgment and chilled media autonomy.\
\
30. President Trump ordered US Marshals to deputize Elon Musk\'92s private security detail (2025-02-20): Granting federal law\uc0\u8209 enforcement powers to a private security team blurred lines between public authority and private protection for a presidential ally.\
\
31. President Trump took over the Kennedy Center board and installed loyalists in leadership (2025-02-16): Seizing control of a major cultural institution\'92s governance allowed the administration to steer publicly supported arts programming toward its own ideological preferences.\
\
32. President Trump nominated Ed Martin, a Stop the Steal activist, as US attorney for DC (2025-02-16): Elevating a partisan figure who defended January 6 defendants to the top prosecutor role in the capital risked turning a key justice office into a tool of factional politics.\
\
33. President Trump oversaw confirmation and swearing-in of Kash Patel as FBI director (2025-02-21): Installing a close loyalist who signaled interest in targeting media and left\uc0\u8209 wing groups at the FBI\'92s helm threatened the bureau\'92s independence and impartial enforcement of federal law.\
\
34. President Trump reassigned ICE acting chief Caleb Vitello over deportation numbers (2025-02-21): Reassigning ICE\'92s acting chief for insufficient deportations reinforced a metric\uc0\u8209 driven enforcement culture and signaled that career survival depends on meeting aggressive removal targets.\
\
35. President Trump reversed planned firings of over 300 National Nuclear Security Administration employees (2025-02-15): Walking back mass NNSA layoffs after backlash showed both the reach of executive personnel power and its susceptibility to political pressure in critical security agencies.\
\
36. President Trump announced plans to abolish the Department of Education via executive order (2025-02-19): Preparing to dissolve a cabinet department by executive action raised questions about the scope of unilateral presidential authority over congressionally created agencies.\
\
37. President Trump used executive authority to reshape NIH funding and governance (2025-02-20): Issuing orders that froze grants, cut billions from research, and blocked advisory committees at NIH centralized scientific funding decisions in the White House and disrupted normal expert\uc0\u8209 driven processes.\
\
38. President Trump removed climate-related grants and references from federal programs and websites (2025-02-21): Stripping climate language and funding from federal research and communications used executive control over information and budgets to downplay a major policy issue.\
\
39. President Trump froze funding for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act implementation (2025-02-20): Halting congressionally approved industrial policy funds for EVs and semiconductors let the executive unilaterally redirect national economic strategy away from prior legislative priorities.\
\
40. President Trump used DOGE to seek deep access to IRS and Social Security data systems (2025-02-17): Pursuing broad DOGE access to sensitive tax and benefits databases concentrated surveillance and analytic power in a lightly accountable presidential initiative.\
\
41. President Trump oversaw DOGE-driven attempts to access Notify.gov mass messaging systems (2025-02-19): Efforts by Musk allies to gain unilateral access to a federal system for texting the public raised the prospect of centralized, politically directed mass messaging under executive influence.\
\
42. President Trump used DOGE to push mass firings and furloughs at USAid and other agencies (2025-02-21): Allowing DOGE to drive furloughs of thousands of USAid and other staff shifted control over foreign aid and development capacity toward a presidentially favored private actor.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Federal courts blocked Trump\'92s birthright citizenship ban and refused to reinstate it on appeal (2025-02-20): By keeping an injunction against ending birthright citizenship in place, appellate judges upheld 14th Amendment protections and checked an executive attempt to redefine citizenship by order.\
\
2. Federal judges declined to block DOGE access to education data and mass federal worker firings (2025-02-21): Allowing controversial data access and large\uc0\u8209 scale layoffs to proceed signaled judicial deference to executive restructuring of agencies and weakened protections for privacy and civil servants.\
\
3. Federal judge Dale E. Ho scrutinized DOJ\'92s motion to dismiss Eric Adams\'92s corruption indictment (2025-02-19): Questioning a politically charged dismissal motion highlighted judicial concern over whether prosecutorial decisions were being driven by law or by White House policy deals.\
\
4. Federal courts allowed USAid to furlough over 2,000 workers despite union objections (2025-02-21): Permitting large furloughs at the foreign aid agency underscored judicial willingness to let the executive pare back development capacity even over organized labor\'92s resistance.\
\
5. Federal judge temporarily blocked firing of diversity staffers at CIA and ODNI (2025-02-18): Protecting DEI staff from immediate dismissal showed courts can still act as a check when executive personnel moves appear targeted at particular viewpoints or identities.\
\
6. Federal courts heard and advanced numerous lawsuits challenging Trump environmental rollbacks (2025-02-19): Climate groups and states sued over expanded offshore drilling and expedited permits, using the judiciary to contest executive efforts to weaken environmental protections.\
\
7. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission moved to dismiss gender-identity discrimination cases citing a binary-sex executive order (2025-02-16): Abandoning six transgender discrimination cases reinterpreted civil-rights law to narrow protections, aligning enforcement with a restrictive executive definition of sex.\
\
8. House Budget Committee Republicans advanced a budget blueprint extending tax cuts and slashing social spending (2025-02-16): Proposing trillions in deficit\uc0\u8209 increasing tax cuts alongside deep reductions to Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs showed Congress using fiscal tools to reshape the welfare state.\
\
9.
