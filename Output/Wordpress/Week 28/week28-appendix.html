<h1>Week 28 Appendix: Confinement as Governance</h1>
<p><em>With no single shock, the administration deepened a regime where law, welfare, and information serve personalized power and stratified citizenship.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and partisan power across multiple fronts, with courts, agencies, immigration enforcement, and trade policy all pulled deeper into a personalized, Trump‑centric project. Structurally, the heaviest pressure falls on judicial independence (Emil Bove’s confirmation despite whistleblower warnings; DOJ attacks on Judge Boasberg; politicized US attorney appointments), the rule of law in immigration and detention (Alien Enemies Act deportations, Alligator Alcatraz, Cecot flights defying court orders), and the stratification of citizenship by ancestry, race, and status (Vance’s redefinition of citizenship, DACA self‑deportation push, SNAP and Medicaid cuts, harsh detention of disabled migrants). Simultaneously, the administration weaponizes economic tools—tariffs, emergency powers, AI‑driven deregulation, and social program retrenchment—to reward allies, punish adversaries at home and abroad, and obscure accountability. Universities and media are squeezed through funding threats, politicized investigations, and licensing leverage, while state‑level moves in Texas and North Carolina entrench gerrymanders and voter suppression. There are pockets of resistance—federal courts blocking birthright and Planned Parenthood cuts, multistate lawsuits, investigative journalism correcting abuses—but the net effect is a marked entrenchment of authoritarian methods inside nominally legal and electoral frameworks.</p>
