# Week 25 Appendix: Immigration Raids as Governance

This week reflects an acute phase of authoritarian consolidation centered on executive overreach, weaponized law, and the hollowing out of the professional state. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling and its greenlighting of mass federal layoffs, combined with Trump’s unilateral use of emergency powers for tariffs, war-making, and immigration crackdowns, sharply weaken checks on the presidency (Traits 1, 4, 5, 13, 14). Simultaneously, large-scale purges and politicization of the civil service—at State, DHS, NWS, FEMA, NASA, and health agencies—erode neutral administration and capacity, especially in diplomacy, public health, and disaster response (Traits 16, 22, 35). Immigration and citizenship policy are used as tools of ideological and ethnic stratification, from TPS terminations and third-country deportations to the attempted end of birthright citizenship, partially checked by lower courts (Traits 4, 45, 47). Militarized immigration raids, National Guard deployments, and aggressive ICE tactics normalize state violence against immigrants and protesters (Traits 8, 9, 41, 50). Parallel information operations—attacks on media, science, and truth around floods, vaccines, and unpopular economic policies—reinforce a chaotic environment that blurs accountability (Traits 21, 52, 53, 60).

Week 25 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump blocked over $6 billion in congressionally approved education funds (2025-07-06): By refusing to release billions for after-school and summer programs that Congress had appropriated, the president undercut legislative control of the purse and signaled a willingness to use impoundment to reshape domestic policy unilaterally.

2. President Trump fired NSA Director Timothy Haugh and his deputy after receiving a loyalty list from an outside influencer (2025-07-06): Removing senior intelligence leaders based on a partisan influencer’s list blurred lines between national security and personal loyalty, weakening professional control over surveillance powers and concentrating authority in the president’s inner circle.

3. President Trump fired six National Security Council staffers deemed disloyal by an outside activist (2025-07-06): Purging National Security Council staff on ideological grounds empowered unelected allies to shape security staffing and discouraged independent analysis inside the executive, eroding neutral expertise in high-stakes decision-making.

4. President Trump pardoned supporters involved in the January 6 Capitol attack (2025-07-06): Granting clemency to people who attacked Congress signaled tolerance for political violence on the president’s behalf and weakened deterrence against future assaults on electoral certification and peaceful transfer of power.

5. President Trump and congressional Republicans enacted a sweeping budget reconciliation law reshaping taxes, social programs, and immigration enforcement (2025-07-05): The new law locked in large tax cuts for the wealthy, slashed Medicaid and SNAP, and massively expanded border wall and ICE funding, redistributing state power and resources away from social protection toward enforcement.

6. President Trump ordered the Department of Justice to target political opponents and critics (2025-07-06): Directing DOJ to scrutinize and punish rivals, including by threatening their security details, subordinated prosecutorial decisions to personal vendettas and weakened the norm of politically neutral law enforcement.

7. President Trump used a national emergency declaration to impose tariffs without Congress (2025-07-06): Invoking emergency powers to set trade barriers bypassed normal legislative processes and normalized using crisis authorities for routine economic policy, expanding unilateral presidential control over trade.

8. President Trump ordered a military strike on Iran without seeking congressional authorization (2025-07-06): Launching a strike on Iran without Congress’s approval sidestepped the constitutional war power, reinforcing a pattern of presidents treating major uses of force as executive prerogatives rather than shared decisions.

9. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all members of a key CDC vaccine advisory panel and installed vaccine skeptics (2025-07-07): Removing established vaccine advisers and replacing them with skeptics politicized a core scientific body, giving executive appointees greater control over immunization policy that affects public health and insurance coverage.

10. Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for Honduran and Nicaraguan immigrants (2025-07-07): Ending long-standing TPS for tens of thousands of Central Americans stripped lawful status from residents integrated into U.S. communities, using executive discretion over humanitarian relief to reorder who is secure under immigration law.

11. Federal Emergency Management Agency leadership restricted staff communications with Congress and local officials during disaster response (2025-07-07): Limiting FEMA personnel’s ability to coordinate and share information with other governments during emergencies centralized control within political appointees and reduced external oversight of life‑saving operations.

12. Trump administration delayed enforcement of a TikTok ban law for 75 days by directive (2025-07-07): Instructing DOJ not to enforce a duly enacted TikTok ban for a set period showed the executive branch selectively choosing which laws to apply, weakening the expectation that statutes bind the presidency.

13. President Trump issued an executive order ending subsidies and tax credits for wind and solar energy (2025-07-07): Eliminating federal support for renewables by executive order shifted energy policy toward fossil and other favored sources without new legislation, concentrating climate‑relevant economic choices in the presidency.

14. President Trump extended a suspension of certain reciprocal tariffs until August 1, 2025 (2025-07-07): By unilaterally extending a tariff pause and signaling the date was flexible, the president underscored how trade partners and domestic firms must navigate shifting economic rules set from the White House rather than Congress.

15. President Trump limited classified information shared with Congress (2025-07-06): Curtailing lawmakers’ access to classified material weakened Congress’s ability to oversee foreign policy and security programs, tilting the balance of power toward the executive on critical national decisions.

16. President Trump took control of California’s National Guard to suppress mostly peaceful immigration protests (2025-07-06): Federalizing and deploying a state’s Guard over the governor’s objections to police protests blurred civil‑military boundaries and used military force to manage domestic dissent and state policy disputes.

17. President Trump expanded the definition of presidential control over foreign affairs via executive order (2025-02-12): Asserting that foreign policy authority rests solely in the presidency narrowed space for congressional and judicial checks on international decisions, strengthening a unitary executive view of external relations.

18. President Trump suggested a federal takeover of New York City if voters elect a disfavored mayoral candidate (2025-07-08): Threatening to seize control of a city’s government based on its electoral choices signaled willingness to override local self‑rule for partisan ends, undermining confidence that municipal elections determine governance.

19. President Trump publicly mused about states deciding whether to restrict access to birth control (2024-01-01): Floating the idea that states could curtail contraception access, even if later walked back, signaled openness to devolving core bodily autonomy rights to majoritarian state politics rather than federal protection.

20. President Trump launched an effort to undermine birthright citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment (2025-07-10): Challenging automatic citizenship for U.S.-born children of undocumented parents used executive power to contest a foundational constitutional rule defining membership in the political community.

21. President Trump signed an executive order promoting AI use in education without educator input (2025-04-30): Mandating AI integration in classrooms through executive order, in coordination with tech firms, shifted control over educational tools and priorities toward the White House and corporate partners rather than local educators and legislatures.

22. White House recruited 68 technology companies to support its AI education agenda (2025-07-09): Enlisting major tech firms to fund and design AI curricula under a presidential pledge deepened executive‑corporate collaboration in shaping how students learn, with limited democratic oversight of data use and content.

23. President Trump announced plans to lay off about 15% of State Department domestic staff (2025-07-10): Ordering large‑scale State Department layoffs as part of an “America First” restructuring concentrated foreign‑policy discretion in fewer, more politically aligned hands and reduced institutional capacity for independent diplomacy.

24. President Trump directed the State Department to issue over 1,300 termination notices in rolling reductions in force (2025-07-11): Implementing rolling RIFs at State following court clearance operationalized the administration’s plan to shrink and reshape the diplomatic corps, reinforcing executive control over who represents the U.S. abroad.

25. President Trump publicly attacked Democrats who opposed his budget bill, saying he hated them (2025-07-06): Declaring hatred for legislators who voted against his signature bill personalized political conflict and further normalized dehumanizing rhetoric toward institutional opposition.

26. President Trump claimed an unpopular budget law was the most popular bill ever signed (2025-07-06): Insisting that polling‑disfavored legislation was overwhelmingly popular exemplified the executive’s use of false claims to frame major policy shifts, complicating informed public judgment of government actions.

27. President Trump suggested states should decide on access to birth control (2024-01-01): Signaling support for state‑level control over contraception access, even briefly, indicated willingness to let fundamental reproductive decisions depend on local political majorities rather than uniform rights.


Institutions and Governance

6. Supreme Court of the United States limited the use of nationwide injunctions against federal policies (2025-07-06): Curtailing lower courts’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions reduced a key tool for quickly halting contested executive actions, making it harder for single cases to protect people outside the filing jurisdiction.

7. Gun Owners of America and allied groups filed a lawsuit arguing the National Firearms Act is now unconstitutional (2025-07-06): Challenging the 1934 National Firearms Act on the basis of new tax and registration changes sought to use recent legislation to weaken long‑standing federal gun controls through the courts.

9. U.S. Department of Justice began handing over sensitive audio tapes in the Kiki Camarena murder case to defense counsel (2025-07-06): Providing long‑withheld recordings in a major cartel prosecution reflected judicially supervised disclosure obligations that can illuminate past abuses and strengthen due process in transnational crime cases.

10.

14. Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts (2025-07-08): Granting absolute and presumptive immunity for many presidential acts raised the bar for holding former presidents criminally accountable, shifting the balance between executive power and legal constraint.

15. Federal appeals court vacated the FTC’s click-to-cancel consumer protection rule (2025-07-08): Striking down a rule that would have simplified subscription cancellations limited the FTC’s ability to curb exploitative business practices, favoring procedural objections over consumer protections.

16. Supreme Court of the United States upheld a block on Florida’s law criminalizing undocumented immigrants entering the state (2025-07-09): Refusing to let Florida enforce SB 4‑C affirmed federal primacy over immigration and prevented a state from independently criminalizing presence, protecting migrants from an aggressive state statute.

26. President Trump nominated Emil Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (2025-07-11): Elevating a loyal DOJ prosecutor accused in a whistleblower complaint of urging defiance of court orders raised concerns that appellate benches are being filled with figures aligned to executive interests.

27. Internal Revenue Service announced a policy allowing churches to endorse political candidates while keeping tax-exempt status (2025-07-09): Relaxing Johnson Amendment enforcement for churches opened the door for tax‑subsidized religious institutions to act as partisan actors, altering the institutional boundary between organized religion and electoral politics.

Economic Structure

1. Trump administration prepared to let a 90-day pause on steep tariffs expire, risking sharp increases on many countries (2025-07-05): Allowing high tariffs to snap back after a brief pause threatened to raise costs for U.S. firms and consumers and injected uncertainty into global trade relationships.

3. Republican Congress and President Trump made 2017 tax cuts permanent while cutting Medicaid and SNAP and boosting ICE and wall funding (2025-07-05): Locking in regressive tax cuts and shrinking safety‑net programs while expanding enforcement budgets reoriented federal spending toward capital and coercion rather than social protection.

4. Congress allocated $170.7 billion for immigration enforcement, including a 265% increase in ICE detention funding (2025-07-06): The unprecedented enforcement budget made ICE the largest federal law‑enforcement agency, channeling public funds into detention and deportation infrastructure instead of alternative public goods.

34. Argentina President Javier Milei implemented deep fiscal austerity by cutting public spending about 31% (2025-07-10): Large reductions in public works, subsidies, pensions, and civil‑service jobs sought to eliminate deficits and inflation but initially increased poverty and unemployment, testing social tolerance for rapid adjustment.

35. Researchers publishing in The Lancet estimated that USAID cuts could cause over 14 million deaths globally in five years (2025-07-07): The projection highlighted how reductions in U.S. development aid can translate into massive health and mortality impacts abroad, especially for children, reframing budget choices as life‑and‑death decisions.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained long-term resident Arpineh Masihi in front of her family in Los Angeles (2025-07-09): Taking a mother who arrived as a child into custody despite her U.S.-born children illustrated the human cost of aggressive interior enforcement on mixed‑status families.

5. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and allied agents conducted a militarized raid in MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, with National Guard support (2025-07-07): Heavily armed raids in an immigrant neighborhood, broadcast as spectacle and yielding few or no arrests, functioned as intimidation against residents and critics of federal immigration policy.
