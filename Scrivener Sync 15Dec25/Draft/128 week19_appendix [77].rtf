\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 19 Appendix: Citizenship as Leverage\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, a coordinated campaign against independent institutions, and intensifying stratification of rights by status and identity. Trump\'92s record pace of executive orders, floated suspension of habeas corpus, and defiance or end-runs around court orders push hard on unchecked presidency and normalized emergency powers. Immigration becomes the central arena: mass-arrest quotas, the planned Office of Remigration, Supreme Court green lights to end parole/TPS, and social-media vetting and visa halts for students collectively move the system toward a tiered citizenship regime. Simultaneously, the administration weaponizes state power against universities, public media, and specific firms, tying funding and access to loyalty while closing analytic and diplomatic capacity inside the State Department. The pardon spree for corrupt officials and wealthy allies, Boeing\'92s non-prosecution deal, and Trump-linked financial schemes deepen crony capitalism and impunity for elite crime. Yet courts, universities, state AGs, parents, and protest movements mount significant resistance, winning injunctions on tariffs, Harvard, WilmerHale, and media funding. Structurally, however, the week\'92s net pressure tilts toward entrenching authoritarian tools even as some guardrails still hold.\
\

Power and Authority\
\
1. President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at military academies (2025-05-24): The order led to the disbanding of student clubs and removal of materials at service academies, narrowing representation and support for women, minorities, and LGBTQ cadets within a key state security institution.\
\
2. Federal Emergency Management Agency under the Trump administration denied North Carolina's request for full federal funding to remove Hurricane Helene debris (2025-05-24): Refusing previously promised disaster aid constrained recovery in a hard\uc0\u8209 hit state, illustrating how federal relief power can be used selectively with major consequences for vulnerable communities\'92 security and trust in national authority.\
\
3. President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on European Union goods and threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products (2025-05-24): Using sweeping unilateral tariffs and threats against a major ally and a single firm concentrated trade power in the presidency, bypassing normal legislative deliberation and raising stakes for economic coercion.\
\
4. President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's privilege to enroll foreign students and demanded information on their activities (2025-05-25): Stripping a university\'92s ability to host international students unless it shares protest and coursework data weaponized immigration and education powers to pressure campus speech and governance.\
\

\
12. President Donald Trump used his pardon power in a series of high\uc0\u8209 profile corruption and fraud cases (2025-05-28): A pattern of pardons for corrupt officials, donors, and allies signaled that executive clemency could be used to neutralize legal accountability for those close to power.\
\
13.

\
15.

President Donald Trump was reported to have used foreign policy and tariffs in ways that aided his private business projects abroad (2025-05-24): Vietnam\'92s fast\uc0\u8209 tracking of Trump\u8209 branded developments amid tariff talks illustrated how presidential leverage over trade can intertwine with personal enrichment, distorting national interest decisions.\

\
22.

\
8. U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration\'92s foreign\uc0\u8209 student ban at Harvard (2025-05-25): The order prevented immediate enforcement of a punitive policy against Harvard, demonstrating judicial capacity to check executive overreach affecting academic institutions and international students.\

\
15. Economic researchers found that U.S. service\uc0\u8209 sector productivity growth has accelerated since 2008 (2025-05-30): Improved productivity in services, aided by technology, suggested potential for higher living standards and more sustainable public\u8209 service provision if gains are broadly shared.\

Civil Rights and Dissent\
\
1.

\
6. U.S. immigration authorities revoked visas for Mexican singer Juli\'f3n \'c1lvarez and his band before a U.S. concert (2025-05-24): Canceling artists\'92 work visas disrupted a major cultural event and highlighted how immigration controls can constrain cross\uc0\u8209 border cultural exchange and expression.\

\
8. Criminal justice system in the United States recorded declines in mass shootings and violent crime rates (2025-05-25): Lower levels of mass shootings and homicides improved baseline public safety, reducing one source of fear that can be exploited to justify repressive measures.\
\
9. Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security ordered immigration agents to triple daily arrests to 3,000 per day (2025-05-28): Imposing a numerical arrest quota encouraged sweeping detentions, including in courthouses and other sensitive locations, heightening risks of due\uc0\u8209 process violations and community intimidation.\
\
10. U.S. Department of Justice under the Trump administration opened an investigation into California\'92s law allowing trans athletes in girls\'92 sports (2025-05-28): Targeting a state law on transgender participation in sports used federal enforcement power to challenge protections for a marginalized group, intensifying politicization of civil\uc0\u8209 rights enforcement.\

\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1. White House under President Donald Trump stopped publishing and removed official transcripts of Trump's speeches from its database (2025-05-24): Eliminating routine transcript publication and deleting past records reduced transparency and made it harder for the public and press to verify the president\'92s statements over time.\
\
2.

5. Trump administration and State Department ordered U.S. embassies to halt scheduling student visa interviews pending social media screening rules (2025-05-27): Freezing interview capacity disrupted academic mobility and signaled that digital\uc0\u8209 speech vetting would become a gatekeeper for educational exchange.\
\
6.
