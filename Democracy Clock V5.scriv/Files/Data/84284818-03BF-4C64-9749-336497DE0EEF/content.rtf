\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 44 of Trump\'92s second term compressed the space inside an already late democratic hour. Federal power moved aggressively into interior cities under the banner of immigration enforcement, with \'93Operation Charlotte\'92s Web\'94 and related raids turning Border Patrol and ICE into tools for disciplining sanctuary jurisdictions. Simultaneously, sweeping executive orders stripped transgender people of recognition, health care, data visibility, and physical safety in shelters, prisons, and the military, making citizenship contingent on identity. The justice system bent toward loyalty and impunity\'97politicized prosecutions, selective pardons, FBI patronage\'97yet some judges exposed misconduct and blocked racially gerrymandered maps. Congress forced near\uc0\u8209 total disclosure of the Epstein files, only to see the administration invoke new investigations and national security to stall release. Saudi-linked deals, trillion\u8209 dollar militarization, and economic spin deepened crony governance.
