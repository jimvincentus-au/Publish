\f2\b \cf2 1. What has been confirmed by reputable sources
\f1\b0 \
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	
\f2\b Multiple respected international outlets
\f1\b0  (e.g., 
\f3\i Associated Press, Reuters, BBC, Al Jazeera
\f1\i0 ) have reported 
\f2\b civilian deaths connected to military or security-force operations in the Caribbean.
\f1\b0 \
	\'95	
\f2\b Local human rights groups and regional NGOs
\f1\b0  have documented 
\f2\b specific incidents involving lethal force
\f1\b0 , though the details vary by country.\
	\'95	
\f2\b Government statements
\f1\b0  in the affected nation have 
\f2\b acknowledged security operations occurred
\f1\b0 , but typically 
\f2\b dispute responsibility
\f1\b0  for civilian deaths or describe them as \'93collateral\'94 or \'93under investigation.\'94\
	\'95	
\f2\b Independent confirmation remains limited
\f1\b0 , due to restricted access to the affected areas and sometimes conflicting official and eyewitness accounts.\

\f2\b \cf2 2. What remains unclear or disputed
\f1\b0 \
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	
\f2\b Exact number of casualties
\f1\b0  \'97 figures reported by NGOs, journalists, and government sources do not align.\
	\'95	
\f2\b Chain of command
\f1\b0  \'97 whether operations were conducted under official military orders, joint security task forces, or irregular/auxiliary forces.\
	\'95	
\f2\b Motivation and context
\f1\b0  \'97 governments often frame the actions as anti-gang, anti-terror, or anti-trafficking operations; NGOs suggest some operations may constitute 
\f2\b extrajudicial or disproportionate use of force.
\f1\b0 \
	\'95	
\f2\b Identification of perpetrators
\f1\b0  \'97 in several cases, witnesses report military uniforms, but the region has issues with 
\f2\b uniform theft, impersonation, and unofficial militias
\f1\b0 , so attribution is not definitive in some events.\

\f2\b \cf2 3. Broader context provided by NGOs and analysts
\f1\b0 \
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	Several Caribbean nations are experiencing 
\f2\b increases in organized-crime violence
\f1\b0  and have deployed military forces in roles normally reserved for civilian police.\
	\'95	Human rights observers have raised concerns about 
\f2\b mission creep
\f1\b0 , 
\f2\b insufficient oversight
\f1\b0 , and 
\f2\b lack of accountability
\f1\b0  when militaries take on domestic policing roles.\
	\'95	The region includes 
\f2\b multiple countries with very different legal systems
\f1\b0 , so the term \'93military killings\'94 refers to 
\f2\b a pattern of incidents, not a single unified operation
\f1\b0 .\

\f2\b \cf2 4. What is being investigated
\f1\b0 \
\pard\tqr\tx100\tx260\li260\fi-260\sl324\slmult1\sb240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	\'95	
\f2\b Human rights organizations
\f1\b0  are calling for independent inquiries.\
	\'95	
\f2\b International bodies
\f1\b0  (OAS, UN special rapporteurs) have made preliminary requests for information but have not yet released formal findings.\
	\'95	
\f2\b Journalist investigations
\f1\b0  are ongoing; some reports rely on anonymous testimony due to safety risks.}
