Week 50: Crony Governance as Structure
A year ends with no new shock but a harder edge, as emergency powers, patronage economics, and tiered citizenship settle into the machinery of rule.
The last week of the year did not bring a new shock. It brought a clearer view of the system that had already taken shape. Power moved through offices and budgets, through courts and culture, in ways that felt familiar by now: partisan, personal, and often punitive. What changed was not the direction of travel but the degree of confidence with which the same tools were used. The state’s core machinery—its civil service, its courts, its economic rules, its border and memory regimes—was pressed further into service of a narrow circle, even as a few institutions still tried to push back. That tension defined the week.
At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:11 p.m. By the end of Week 50, it remained at 8:11 p.m., a net change of zero minutes. The stillness in the measure did not mean stasis in the world. It reflected a week in which many traits of democratic erosion deepened at once, but in ways that reinforced patterns already present rather than opening new fronts. Executive power stretched further, civil service norms frayed, money bent law and policy, and citizenship grew more stratified. At the same time, courts, state governments, and a few corporate actors registered enough resistance to keep the overall risk from lurching higher. The balance of movement and counter-movement left the clock where it was, even as the underlying structure hardened.
The most visible structural change came inside the government’s own workforce. The newly created Department of Government Efficiency, led by a private tech magnate, moved from concept to instrument. Under its banner, the administration announced a ten percent cut to the federal workforce, framed as a purge of “dead weight” and “deep state” obstruction. The cuts were not random. They fell heaviest on agencies that had once served as checks: USAID’s development programs, climate and environmental offices, and regulatory staff who had the expertise to say no. What looked like a drive for lean government was, in practice, a reshaping of who inside the state could still resist. The civil service itself became a target.
Alongside the cuts came new tools of control. DOGE claimed sweeping access to federal employee data, from performance reviews to internal communications, in the name of rooting out inefficiency and disloyalty. The reach of this data grab was broad enough that a court later stepped in to enjoin parts of it, but not before the message had been sent: every civil servant was now legible to a political center that prized loyalty. ICE, for its part, launched a $100 million recruitment blitz, using geofenced ads to target ideologically aligned applicants and promising them a role in “taking the country back.” Hiring became another front in the politicization of the bureaucracy. The tools of management turned into tools of sorting.
Immigration enforcement agencies were retooled in parallel. ICE and related offices were given denaturalization quotas and told to prioritize cases involving people from Muslim-majority countries or those seen as ideological opponents. Warehouse-style detention centers expanded, with reports of harsh conditions treated as proof of toughness rather than cause for reform. A hardline immigration official, Tom Homan, was pushed toward a senior role despite bypassed vetting and public controversy, underscoring that the key qualification was alignment with the president’s agenda. The civil service, in this domain, was no longer a neutral executor of law. It was an arm of a project to redraw the boundaries of belonging.
Executive power over the broader policy landscape followed the same pattern. The president declared nine separate national emergencies, some tied to foreign crises, others to domestic policy fights. One of these declarations was used to launch a unilateral tariff war, bypassing Congress and treating trade law as a personal lever. Another framed immigration as an existential threat that justified mass deportations and denaturalizations. The formal structure of emergency law remained in place, but its use shifted from rare response to routine tactic. Each new declaration made it easier to treat extraordinary powers as a standing option rather than a last resort. Emergency became a mode of governance.
Courts did not simply acquiesce. The Supreme Court and lower federal courts issued rulings that constrained some of the most aggressive moves. Attempts to deploy the National Guard into cities for domestic political ends met judicial limits. A key decision upheld the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, preserving a pocket of regulatory independence. In the immigration arena, judges sanctioned abuses and ordered relief in specific cases. Yet other courts, including an appeals court that allowed states to defund Planned Parenthood, moved in the opposite direction. The result was a rule-of-law landscape that was polarized and uneven: strong enough in places to slow the executive, too weak in others to protect vulnerable groups from targeted policy. Justice depended on where a case landed.
The line between executive discretion and weaponized federal power grew thinner. The White House vetoed a bipartisan Colorado water bill and a Miccosukee Everglades restoration measure, both framed as wasteful or overreaching. In practice, the vetoes punished states and communities that had opposed the president or advanced climate policies he disliked. Selective federal cuts and threats against states with climate “superfund” laws sent the same signal. Federal power, once assumed to be at least somewhat even-handed, was now openly used to reward allies and discipline opponents. The losers were not only state officials but the local communities whose water, land, and health depended on those projects.
Inside the courts themselves, money and elite preference showed through. An appeals court ruling allowed states to cut off Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding, aligning with long-standing demands from conservative donors and advocacy networks. In another case, a Medicare rule that would have reduced payments to a powerful healthcare firm was delayed after a $5 million donation flowed to a pro-Trump political committee. The timing was not subtle. The legal process moved in ways that tracked donor interests, even as formal doctrine remained intact. For ordinary litigants and patients, the message was clear: access to care and justice could hinge on the financial clout of those on the other side.
Regulatory agencies were pulled into the same orbit. DOGE’s restructuring of USAID and other programs did not just cut budgets; it redirected what remained toward projects favored by Trump-aligned elites. A bailout for Argentina, structured in ways that benefited a friend of the Treasury Secretary, showed how foreign economic policy could double as a rescue package for insiders. Tariff carve-outs were granted to select sectors with close ties to the administration, while competitors bore the brunt of the trade war. A Medicare decision that spared a well-connected firm from immediate cost controls fit the same pattern. Agencies that once balanced public and private interests now served as channels through which private allies could turn access into advantage.
The boundary between policy and profit blurred further in the realm of law. Reports surfaced of an alleged pay-for-pardon scheme, in which wealthy individuals or their intermediaries offered large sums in exchange for clemency. Even as details remained contested, the need for congressional subpoenas and the resistance they met from the Department of Justice suggested that the matter touched sensitive networks. When the power to forgive crimes can be bought, the law ceases to be a shared constraint and becomes a commodity. Those without means face the full weight of enforcement; those with money and access can negotiate their own terms.
Crony capitalism, in this week, was not an accusation. It was a description of how decisions were made. The Musk-led DOGE, with its sweeping budget authority, fused public austerity with private opportunity. Cuts to social programs and regulatory staff freed resources and space for projects that aligned with the interests of a narrow set of tech and finance elites. The Argentina bailout, the Medicare delay, the tariff carve-outs, and the insider-friendly budget choices all pointed in the same direction. Governance and enrichment were no longer separate spheres. They were two faces of the same system.
The structure of the economy reflected this fusion. In North Carolina, the General Assembly advanced tax cuts that favored wealthy individuals and corporations, despite clear warnings that the move would strain childcare, healthcare, and other basic services. At the federal level, enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired, raising premiums for more than twenty million enrollees. Drugmakers, acting in concert, raised prices on hundreds of medications at the same time. The combined effect was to shift risk and cost onto workers and families while preserving or increasing profits for firms and investors. Inequality was not treated as a problem to be solved. It was built into the design.
These economic choices had political consequences. As healthcare costs rose and safety nets thinned, workers became more dependent on their employers and less able to risk job loss or political dissent. Labor protections, already weakened, eroded further in practice. When losing a job means losing affordable care, the space for organizing or speaking out narrows. The system did not need to ban unions or protests outright. It only needed to make the price of resistance high enough that many people would think twice before paying it.
The right to vote and to be fairly represented came under pressure through more technical means. In North Carolina, the state election board was restructured in ways that gave partisan actors greater control, justified as a fix for supposed fraud. Racially biased gerrymandering plans advanced, drawing districts that diluted the power of Black and Latino voters while preserving safe seats for the ruling party. In Congress, a resolution condemned intra-party election manipulation, but the underlying practices continued. Each change could be defended as a tweak to process. Together, they made it harder for disfavored communities to translate their numbers into power.
Citizenship itself became more layered and conditional. Mass denaturalization quotas signaled that even those who had completed the formal path to citizenship could find their status reopened. A pause on naturalizations from certain countries, framed as a security measure, placed origin above individual conduct. Deportations to harsh foreign prisons, sometimes in defiance of court orders, showed how little protection the law offered to those on the wrong side of the new hierarchy. Anti-Muslim rhetoric from senior officials tied these policies to a broader narrative about who truly belonged. Wealth and ideology, as much as birthplace, now shaped one’s standing before the state.
Religion was drawn into this project as a tool of legitimacy. Multiple departments coordinated messaging that cast the administration as the defender of Christians at home and abroad. Foreign military strikes, including in Venezuela and Nigeria, were framed not only as counter-narcotics or counter-terrorism operations but as actions to protect Christian communities. Domestically, this language blurred the line between citizenship and adherence to a particular religious identity. Those outside the favored faith could be cast, implicitly or explicitly, as less deserving of protection or more suspect in their loyalties.
Violence, or the threat of it, backed these shifts. ICE was armed and expanded in ways that made it resemble a paramilitary force more than a traditional civil agency. Militarized federal agents appeared in cities under the cover of law enforcement, often in contexts that overlapped with political protest or local resistance to federal policy. In Venezuela, large-scale lethal operations were justified as strikes against “narco-terrorists,” with little transparency about targets or civilian harm. Courts and some state officials pushed back against the most blatant abuses, but the overall trend was clear: when violence served elite interests or the president’s narrative, it was tolerated and even praised.
The same pattern of protection for the powerful and exposure for the rest appeared in the handling of elite crimes. The Department of Justice acknowledged the existence of five million Epstein-related documents after earlier undercounting them, raising questions about what had been concealed and why. Congress passed bipartisan legislation to force greater transparency, and members threatened contempt or even impeachment if DOJ continued to stall. Yet the department slow-walked production, heavily redacted what it did release, and resisted broader disclosure. The alleged sale of pardons, the shielding of Epstein networks, and the need for extraordinary pressure to pry open archives all pointed to a system in which the law bent around those closest to power.
Information about these dynamics was itself contested terrain. The administration imposed visa bans on foreign researchers who had worked to expose disinformation networks, signaling that even non-citizens who challenged elite narratives could face retaliation. A major broadcaster, CBS, suppressed an investigative report into a pro-Trump influence operation known as CICOT, after internal and external pressure. At the same time, the president used his social media accounts to spread high-volume false claims about wind energy, the Epstein case, and other topics, while campaign operations sent deceptive fundraising emails disguised as surveys. Independent scrutiny was constrained; regime-aligned messaging flowed freely.
Data and algorithms were part of this struggle. ICE’s recruitment campaign used geofenced ads to reach specific ideological pools, turning location and behavioral data into a filter for who would be invited into the enforcement apparatus. Political operatives used similar tools to micro-target fundraising and propaganda, segmenting the public into audiences to be nudged or inflamed. The same digital infrastructure that could have been used to inform and serve the public was instead deployed to manipulate and mobilize it in ways that served those in power.
Memory institutions did not stand apart. The Kennedy Center, a flagship cultural venue, changed its bylaws to concentrate control in the hands of Trump appointees and moved to rename itself in a way that foregrounded the president. Decisions about programming and funding began to track political loyalty, with artists critical of the administration finding themselves sidelined. Elsewhere, a local school district in Chapel Hill faced partisan attacks that were part of a broader effort to weaken public education in North Carolina. Civic education, already under strain, was pushed further toward market and ideological models that favored obedience over critical thought.
Government archives, the raw material of future accountability, were also at risk. DOJ’s undercounting and partial withholding of Epstein files was not an isolated clerical error. It fit a pattern in which sensitive records about elite misconduct were delayed, sanitized, or kept from public view. Congressional investigators had to threaten contempt to secure even incremental progress. The more time that passed, the easier it became to lose documents, to let memories fade, and to allow narratives curated by those in power to harden into the public record.
What lay ahead was already partly scheduled. Congress had set deadlines for DOJ to produce the full set of Epstein documents, with clear consequences if it failed. Courts had hearings on the legality of DOGE’s data access and on specific deportation abuses. State legislatures, including in North Carolina, had calendars for revisiting election laws and tax codes. These dates did not guarantee outcomes. They did, however, mark points at which the contest between consolidation and resistance would surface in formal arenas.
In the arc of Trump’s second term, Week 50 did not announce a new phase. It deepened the one already underway. The civil service was further bent toward political ends. Emergency powers and unilateral actions became more routine. Law and policy tilted more openly toward donors and insiders. Citizenship and memory were carved into tiers, with some histories and lives protected, others exposed. Yet courts, state governments, and a few corners of civil society still showed they could draw lines, however narrow. The clock’s stillness captured that tension: a democracy under sustained pressure, not yet past the point where resistance could matter, but moving no closer to safety.
