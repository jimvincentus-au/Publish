# Week 22 Appendix: Law, Force, and Memory

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a sharp erosion of protections for vulnerable groups, especially immigrants and LGBTQ people. Trump’s assertion of direct control over U.S. Steel, repeated defiance or manipulation of statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delays, National Guard federalization, DHS oversight rules), and deregulatory favors to crypto and fossil-fuel interests all push toward unchecked, personalized rule. Immigration enforcement is openly weaponized against Democratic cities and individual officials, while congressional oversight of detention is obstructed. Political violence escalates with the Minnesota assassinations, amid right‑wing disinformation that inverts blame. Simultaneously, courts deliver mixed signals: the Supreme Court entrenches anti‑trans policy and opens new avenues to attack state climate rules, even as lower courts block some discriminatory grant cuts, firings, and funding leverage. Civil society mobilization is massive (No Kings protests, local resistance to ICE), but met with militarized responses and chilling rhetoric from governors and federal agencies. Information and memory systems are reshaped through mass layoffs at Voice of America, symbolic purges in the White House, and rollback of Juneteenth and DEI recognition, signaling a broader authoritarian narrative project.

Week 22 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump issued executive orders targeting sanctuary cities for defunding and prosecution of officials (2025-06-14): The orders sought to punish sanctuary jurisdictions and criminalize local resistance to federal immigration enforcement, expanding direct presidential leverage over cities and officials that oppose his policies.

2. President Trump attempted by executive order to cancel birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants (2025-06-15): The order directly challenged a long‑standing constitutional guarantee, signaling willingness to unilaterally redefine citizenship and legal status for a large class of residents.

3. President Trump ordered mass ICE deportation focus on Democratic‑run cities via social media directives (2025-06-15): By directing immigration raids toward political opponents’ jurisdictions, the president used federal coercive power in a partisan manner that can chill opposition and distort representation.

4. President Trump and senior aides reversed a brief pause on workplace immigration raids in key industries after pressure from hardliners (2025-06-17): The rapid reversal showed immigration enforcement being driven by ideological and political demands rather than stable policy, heightening uncertainty for workers and employers.

5. President Trump announced concessions and carveouts in immigration enforcement for agriculture and hospitality sectors (2025-06-15): Exempting certain industries from raids while intensifying enforcement elsewhere tied the use of state power to economic allies and donors, rather than neutral legal principles.

6. President Trump deployed National Guard and active‑duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections to police protests (2025-06-15): Federalizing state forces to manage largely local protests without gubernatorial consent concentrated coercive power in the presidency and weakened state control over domestic security.

9. President Trump extended by executive order the enforcement delay of the TikTok divestiture law despite statutory and judicial deadlines (2025-06-19): Unilaterally suspending enforcement of a congressionally mandated, court‑upheld requirement asserted executive primacy over both legislature and judiciary in regulating a major communications platform.

10. President Trump ordered Michigan coal plants to remain open under a national energy emergency authority (2025-06-20): Invoking emergency powers to override state climate law and planned closures entrenched presidential control over energy choices and favored fossil interests over state policy and public input.

11. President Trump held a large military parade in Washington, D.C., on his birthday with corporate sponsorship (2025-06-14): The spectacle used military symbols and public resources to elevate the leader’s personal image, normalizing leader‑centric displays more common in less democratic systems.

12. President Trump removed the Martin Luther King Jr. bust from the Oval Office and declined to document its relocation (2025-06-15): Altering prominent civil‑rights symbolism in the presidential office without transparency signaled a shift in the administration’s public commitments to racial equality and historical memory.

13. President Trump replaced Hillary Clinton’s official First Lady portrait with a painting of himself in a White House display (2025-06-18): Substituting his own image for a predecessor’s in an institutional portrait space personalized state symbolism and edited official memory without process.

President Trump publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and questioned his continued role (2025-06-18): Presidential denunciations of the central bank chief threatened the perceived independence of monetary policy, which is important for economic stability and insulation from partisan pressure.

15. President Trump made escalating public statements about Iran including calls for unconditional surrender and warnings to evacuate Tehran (2025-06-18): Maximalist rhetoric about Iran’s surrender and potential strikes raised the stakes of presidential war‑making decisions and risked committing the country toward conflict without clear congressional authorization.

16.

3. U.S. District Court in Boston issued an injunction allowing transgender and intersex people to update gender markers on passports despite an executive order (2025-06-17): The ruling protected access to accurate federal identification for trans and intersex citizens, pushing back against an executive attempt to restrict recognition of gender identity.

4. U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender‑affirming care for minors and allowed challenges to California’s vehicle emission waiver (2025-06-20): These decisions narrowed equal‑protection protections for transgender youth and opened state climate rules to attack, shifting legal baselines on civil rights and environmental federalism.

5. Federal appeals court rejected Trump’s bid to have DOJ lawyers represent him in the E.
