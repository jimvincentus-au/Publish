Week 4 of Trump’s second term marks a shift from testing boundaries to constructing a new architecture of power. The administration centralizes hiring and firing authority in Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, triggers mass buyouts and layoffs across core agencies, and grants private actors sweeping access to federal personnel and financial data. Inspectors general, ethics officers, and National Archives leaders are purged as anti‑corruption tools like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are paused and prosecutions of useful allies are dropped. ICE raids, sanctuary‑city lawsuits, and racially stratified refugee policies redefine who is protected by the state. Simultaneously, federal websites, archives, and monuments are scrubbed of DEI, LGBTQ+, and climate content, while a “Big Delete” at NSA and edits at Stonewall recast public memory. Courts, states, unions, and civil society win important injunctions and mount lawsuits, but the Democracy Clock’s jump from 8:02 to 8:25 p.m. reflects that resistance is being outpaced by coordinated structural capture.
