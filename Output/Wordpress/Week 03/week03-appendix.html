<h1>Week 3 Appendix: Systems as Spoils</h1>
<p><em>In Trump’s third week back in office, executive power fused with private wealth, hollowing out oversight while courts and unions fought rearguard actions.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive acceleration of authoritarian consolidation across multiple fronts. The most acute pressures fall on executive constraint, civil service neutrality, rule of law, and information integrity. Trump and Musk’s DOGE apparatus gained or entrenched access to core state infrastructure—Treasury payments, HR databases, USAID, SBA, Education, NOAA, CMS, and even air traffic control—often without statutory authority or proper clearances, then partially backtracked only under litigation threat. Simultaneously, the Justice Department and FBI were purged of officials tied to Trump and January 6 cases, while civil rights, foreign bribery, and foreign influence enforcement were dismantled. Mass pardons for January 6 defendants, blanket firings of prosecutors, and weaponization-themed orders reframed accountability as “weaponization.” DEI, LGBTQ, immigrant, and environmental protections were rolled back via sweeping executive orders and personnel moves, while religion was mobilized through anti-DEI and “anti-Christian bias” taskforces. Internationally, tariffs, aid freezes, UN withdrawals, ICC sanctions, and a Gaza “takeover” proposal signaled a sharp break with liberal multilateralism. Courts, unions, states, and Congress mounted notable resistance—blocking the fund freeze, birthright order, trans-prison policy, buyouts, and DOGE access—but these are defensive holds against a rapidly centralizing presidency–oligarch nexus.</p>
