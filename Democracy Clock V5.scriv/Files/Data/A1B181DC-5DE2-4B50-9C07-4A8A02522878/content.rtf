\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 8 marks a quiet but decisive turn toward conditional citizenship and obscured governance. The administration moved to end birthright citizenship, suspend refugee resettlement, and invoke emergency powers at the southern border, while targeting Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil and other noncitizens for detention and deportation based on speech and nationality. Immigration law became an instrument of ideological discipline. Inside the state, Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency and a suite of executive orders accelerated mass firings, lease terminations, and agency shrinkage, even as federal judges ordered tens of thousands of civil servants reinstated and demanded DOGE records. Transparency and memory took direct hits: USAID staff were told to shred or burn records, advisory meetings at the Census Bureau, FEC, CDC, and FDA were canceled, and USAGM was defunded, starving independent media. Congress largely ratified executive priorities through a Trump-shaped budget and deregulatory votes. Civil society protests and scattered court injunctions registered as resistance, but the Democracy Clock\'92s two\uc0\u8209 minute move captured structural damage to equal membership, open records, and shared facts.\
