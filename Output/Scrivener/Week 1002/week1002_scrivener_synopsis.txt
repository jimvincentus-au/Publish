This chapter steps back from weekly events to examine the Preamble as the republic’s original job description. It treats the Six Promises—Union, Justice, Tranquility, Defense, Welfare, and Liberty—not as poetic flourish but as measurable performance standards. Each promise is traced to the failures of earlier republics: faction and disunity, partisan courts, violent conflict, external vulnerability, elite capture of prosperity, and arbitrary power. The narrative follows how these commitments have expanded and contracted across American history, revealing both their durability and their exclusions. It argues that the promises form an interlocking system: strain in one inevitably distorts the others. In the contemporary era, they become a diagnostic tool for democratic health, distinguishing a government that serves the public from one that serves itself. The chapter closes by pivoting from founding purpose to modern imperatives—the operational work required to keep those promises real.
