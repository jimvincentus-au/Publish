\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 33 unfolds as a study in how war, law, and information can be fused into a single governing style. Trump formally rebrands the Pentagon as the Department of War while ordering a lethal strike in the Caribbean without clear authorization and extending National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., turning federal uniforms into a daily presence in civilian life. Immigration becomes the main testbed: a massive ICE and CBP hiring surge, spyware contracts, bond appeals, and retaliatory prosecutions build a quasi-paramilitary apparatus around non\uc0\u8209 citizens, even as courts scramble to halt the deportation of hundreds of children. The Justice Department targets ActBlue, sanctuary cities, protesters, and a sitting member of Congress, while floating a gun ban for transgender people and selectively curating Epstein files. Public media, universities, and the civil service are punished or politicized. Courts, states, and localities win narrow victories on tariffs, emergency powers, Harvard\'92s funding, and voting access, holding the Democracy Clock at 7:58 p.m. even as its internal gears grind toward consolidation.\
