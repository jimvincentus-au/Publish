\fs24 \cf0 The most dangerous moment is not when the law is broken, but when its abuses are accepted as routine. \'97 From a twentieth-century jurist\
\pard\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\sl264\slmult1\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\s0
\fs26 \cf0 The week opened with a transfer of power that, on paper, was routine. One president left, another took the oath, and the familiar pageantry unfolded at the Capitol. Almost everything that followed pushed in the opposite direction of routine. Within hours, the new administration used the tools of the presidency not to steady the system but to bend it. Executive orders came in waves, not as discrete policy choices but as a kind of shock treatment aimed at immigration, climate, civil rights, public health, and the justice system itself. The pattern was not subtle. Power was pulled upward and inward, toward the person of the president and his loyalists, while the institutions meant to check that power were sidelined, purged, or repurposed. It was a week in which the formal shell of democracy remained, but the habits that give it life were pushed hard toward something more brittle and more dangerous.\
\
At the start of the period, the Democracy Clock was at 7:31 p.m., well past the safe daylight of a low\uc0\u8209 risk democracy. After five days, it read 7:45 p.m., a 14-minute jump. That\'92s a significant move for just one week, reflecting more than just the volume of orders and announcements. Thirty\u8209 one of the sixty tracked traits of democratic h\u8804 \u937 ealth shifted toward midnight. Executive power without proper oversight became more entrenched. Emergency powers were normalized. The civil service was politicized. Law was used as a weapon rather than a limit. Oversight bodies were fired or frozen. Wealth and proximity to the president bought not just access but law itself. The clock moved because these were not isolated abuses, but structural changes that, taken together, made it more difficult for any future government to restore a stable, accountable order.\
\
The clearest signal of that shift came in the way the new president treated the law. On his first day, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted in connection with the January 6 attack on the Capitol, including leaders of extremist groups and those who assaulted police officers. He directed the Justice Department to drop hundreds of pending cases and, by week\'92s end, ordered prosecutors to halt all ongoing January 6 matters. Police unions and federal judges, including those who had presided over the trials, condemned the move as an affront to the rule of law and to the officers who had been beaten and maimed. One judge stressed that clemency could not erase the historical record of the violence or the fact that the attack had sought to overturn an election. Yet the legal reality changed overnight. Acts that had been prosecuted as crimes against democracy were recast as forgivable, even honorable, in the eyes of the state. Law, in this domain, no longer constrained power; it was bent to protect those who had used force on its behalf.\
\
The same pattern appeared in the treatment of other favored constituencies. The president pardoned nearly two dozen anti\uc0\u8209 abortion activists convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a law designed to shield patients and staff from threats and blockades. He then issued an order enforcing the Hyde Amendment, tightening restrictions on federal funding for abortion, and signed an executive order that folded fetal personhood language into federal policy by declaring that life begins at conception. These moves did not simply signal a policy preference. They told a particular set of activists that the state would not only share their aims but also shield them from the legal consequences of intimidation and obstruction. At the same time, the Justice Department froze all civil rights cases, instructing its civil rights division to stop filing complaints or new legal documents. The machinery that had been used to protect vulnerable groups was idled, while the machinery that could be used to protect the president\'92s allies was put into high gear.\
\
Nowhere was the weaponization of law more visible than in the treatment of January 6 itself. Beyond the pardons and dropped cases, administration officials floated the idea of inviting some of the rioters to the White House. In a televised interview, the president described the violence against police as \'93very minor incidents\'94 and suggested that he had done what his predecessor should have done for his own allies. Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, thanked the president for giving him his life back and spoke openly of seeking revenge against those who had prosecuted him. Federal judges responded in unusually sharp terms, warning that the pardons undermined the tradition of peaceful transfer of power and could not rewrite the facts of the day. One January 6 defendant, Pam Hemphill, publicly rejected her pardon, saying that to accept it would be to participate in a lie. But the legal signal to future would\uc0\u8209 be insurrectionists was unmistakable: violence in service of the leader could be forgiven wholesale, and those who carried it out might even be welcomed back into the political fold.\
\
While law was being bent to protect allies, it was also being sharpened against perceived enemies. On inauguration day, the president signed orders directing the attorney general and the intelligence community to investigate the \'93weaponization\'94 of the federal government under his predecessor and to probe alleged censorship of conservative speech. The language suggested a neutral search for misconduct, but the targets were clear: public health officials, intelligence veterans, and members of the January 6 committee who had challenged him. In the states, an Idaho legislator introduced a bill to prosecute Dr. Anthony Fauci despite a federal pardon, and House Republicans formed a new January 6 subcommittee designed to undermine the prior inquiry that had found the president responsible for inciting the attack. The law, in these hands, became a tool for rewriting history and intimidating those who had tried to hold power to account.\
\
The week also saw a decisive move to concentrate power in the executive branch through emergency declarations. On his first day, the president declared a national emergency at the southern border, despite crossings being at a five\uc0\u8209 year low. He issued a separate order \'93clarifying\'94 the military\'92s role in protecting territorial integrity, directing the Pentagon to revise its command plans so that active\u8209 duty troops could be deployed for border enforcement. Within days, the Defense Department announced the deployment of 1,500 additional soldiers to the border, joining thousands already present. Another order declared a national energy emergency, instructing agencies to use all lawful emergency authorities to accelerate fossil fuel production, fast\u8209 track permits, and roll back environmental safeguards. These declarations were not responses to sudden disasters. They were policy choices framed as emergencies, which allowed the president to bypass Congress, reassign funds, and blur the line between civilian and military roles.\
\
The militarization of domestic policy did not stop at the border. The president fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first woman to lead a branch of the armed forces, criticizing her focus on diversity and ordering the Coast Guard to increase its presence in maritime areas to intercept migrants despite existing personnel shortages. He removed the head of the Transportation Security Administration and the entire Aviation Security Advisory Committee, and he sidelined roughly 160 career staff at the National Security Council. These moves stripped away experienced, nonpartisan leadership in favor of appointees more likely to align with his agenda. In parallel, he re\uc0\u8209 implemented a version of Schedule F, creating a new category of policy\u8209 influencing federal employees who could be dismissed at will. A union representing Treasury employees sued, arguing that the order revived a spoils system Congress had rejected a century earlier. But the signal to the bureaucracy was clear: loyalty to the president, not to law or expertise, would determine who stayed and who went.\
\
Oversight bodies that might have checked these moves were themselves targeted. On January 24, the president fired the inspectors general of at least a dozen major agencies in what observers described as a purge. Federal law requires advance notice to Congress before such removals, but there was no sign that this process had been followed. Inspectors general are the internal watchdogs of the federal system, empowered to audit, investigate, and report on waste, fraud, and abuse. Removing them en masse did more than clear out a few troublesome officials. It sent a message that independent scrutiny of executive actions would not be tolerated. At the same time, the administration froze civil rights enforcement, halted police reform agreements in jurisdictions with documented misconduct, and ordered the Justice Department to pursue state and local officials in \'93sanctuary\'94 cities who resisted federal immigration demands. The combined effect was to strip away both internal and external checks on how power was used.\
\
Immigration policy became the main stage on which these new powers were exercised. Within hours of taking office, the president canceled the CBP One app, which had allowed hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers to schedule appointments at ports of entry. Some 30,000 existing appointments were wiped out overnight, leaving families who had waited months in dangerous border cities with no legal path forward. He suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, halted parole programs that had allowed certain migrants to live and work legally while seeking permanent status, and reimposed the \'93Remain in Mexico\'94 policy, forcing asylum seekers to wait in some of the most violent regions of that country while their cases crawled through U.S. courts. A separate order suspended the ability to seek asylum at the southern border altogether, a move civil liberties groups called unprecedented. ICE and Border Patrol were authorized to arrest people in churches, schools, and hospitals, reversing long\uc0\u8209 standing protections for \'93sensitive locations.\'94 Expedited removal was expanded nationwide, allowing deportations without hearings for people who could not prove two years\'92 residence. The Justice Department went further, instructing legal service providers to stop assisting immigrants in court. In the space of a week, the legal architecture that had governed asylum and refugee protection for decades was gutted by executive fiat.\
\
These policies did not remain abstract. Reports from California described ICE raids that caused a quarter of the workforce in parts of the citrus industry to stay home out of fear. A seafood wholesaler in Newark was raided, and among those arrested was a Puerto Rican veteran, raising questions about racial profiling and due process. The administration\'92s own rhetoric framed migrants as an \'93invasion,\'94 and the president\'92s orders directed agencies to treat them as national security threats. The Department of Justice created a working group to identify local laws that \'93harbor\'94 undocumented people and threatened criminal charges against officials who refused to cooperate. In Mississippi, a state legislator proposed a bounty hunter program that would pay private citizens for each deportation they helped secure. In Congress, the Laken Riley Act, mandating detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft\uc0\u8209 related crimes, passed both chambers with bipartisan support and headed to the president\'92s desk. The line between criminal law and immigration status blurred, and the presumption of due process for non\u8209 citizens narrowed sharply.\
\
At the same time, the administration moved to redefine who counts as a citizen at all. On January 20, the president signed an order titled \'93Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\'94 declaring that children born in the United States to mothers who were unlawfully present, or lawfully present but temporary, and whose fathers were neither citizens nor permanent residents, would no longer receive automatic citizenship. The order directly challenged the settled reading of the Fourteenth Amendment. Within days, California and a coalition of states sued, calling it a flagrant violation of the Constitution. A federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary restraining order, and another judge in Washington, D.C., described the policy as \'93blatantly unconstitutional.\'94 Yet the administration\'92s intent was plain: to stratify citizenship by lineage and legal status, and to test whether the courts would stand in the way. Even blocked, the order introduced uncertainty into the lives of mixed\uc0\u8209 status families and signaled to would\u8209 be immigrants that their children\'92s place in the polity could be revoked by decree.\
\
The same impulse to redraw the boundaries of belonging appeared in domestic policy. On his first day, the president signed an order titled \'93Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,\'94 which mandated that federal policy recognize only two biological sexes and required agencies to strip out any protections based on gender identity. He promised to reinstate a ban on transgender service members in the military and to bar transgender women from women\'92s sports. Another order shut down all federal diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility offices, placed their staff on leave, and set in motion plans for layoffs. A separate order revoked the Equal Employment Opportunity framework that had, since 1965, barred discrimination by federal contractors. Together, these moves dismantled decades of civil rights infrastructure inside the federal government. They did not simply change the language of policy. They removed the people and offices charged with enforcing fairness, leaving women, LGBTQ+ employees, and minorities with fewer tools to contest discrimination.\
\
Public health and science, too, were pulled into the orbit of political control. On January 21, the administration ordered a communications blackout at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. Health advisories, scientific reports, and website updates were paused pending review by political appointees. Scientific meetings necessary for grant funding and disease surveillance were canceled. Travel for health agency staff was frozen, and new contracts and grants were halted, including for foreign health projects. The United States simultaneously began the process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization and suspended nearly all foreign aid, with narrow exceptions for military assistance to Israel and Egypt. Public health experts warned that these steps would cripple outbreak response and research at home and abroad. The administration framed them as necessary to stop \'93waste\'94 and \'93weaponization,\'94 but the effect was to blind both the public and policymakers to emerging threats and to sever ties with the very institutions designed to coordinate global responses.\
\
The economic and ethical landscape shifted as well. Just before and during his inauguration, the president launched personal cryptocurrencies\'97TRUMP and MELANIA\'97that quickly reached multibillion\uc0\u8209 dollar valuations on paper. Major exchanges under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission rushed to list the tokens, apparently hoping that their support would buy regulatory relief. Commentators noted that buying the coins functioned as a way to transfer wealth to the president without triggering campaign finance rules, since the value of his holdings rose with each purchase. At the same time, his private company expanded its online store, adding more than a hundred new products tied to his return to the White House and generating millions in revenue. The Trump Organization quietly revised its ethics statement to remove prior limits on foreign deals, even as Jared Kushner\'92s firm secured $2 billion from Saudi Arabia and partnered with the Trump Organization on a luxury tower in Belgrade financed by foreign governments. These were not small grifts at the margins. They were a new way of doing politics, in which public office and private enrichment were fused, and in which foreign powers could, in effect, buy favor through investments and real estate.\
\
Energy and climate policy were reshaped in ways that favored those same interests. The president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement for a second time and ordered an end to offshore wind leasing and the federal push for electric vehicles. He signed orders titled \'93Unleashing American Energy\'94 and \'93Unleashing Alaska\'92s Extraordinary Resource Potential,\'94 instructing agencies to reverse restrictions on drilling, mining, and logging, and to rescind regulations that hindered fossil fuel projects. A separate memorandum, \'93Putting People over Fish,\'94 directed the Commerce and Interior departments to reroute water from California\'92s Sacramento\'96San Joaquin delta to agriculture and urban users, overriding state policies and years of negotiated environmental protections. A report released the same week documented that oil and gas companies had spent $445 million in the last election cycle to support the president and allied members of Congress. The alignment between policy and donor interest was not subtle. It showed how wealth could buy not just access but the shape of the law itself.\
\
Even the symbolic realm of history and identity was not left untouched. An executive order renamed Denali back to Mount McKinley and the Gulf of Mexico to the \'93Gulf of America,\'94 instructing federal agencies to revise maps and communications accordingly. Another order mandated the declassification of thousands of records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. On its face, the declassification order was a step toward transparency, and it may yet yield a fuller public record. But paired with the renaming of landmarks and the removal of a government website that had helped women understand their health rights, it fit a broader pattern: memory curated from above. Some histories were elevated, others erased or made harder to access. The administration\'92s allies in Congress formed a new January 6 panel not to deepen accountability but to cast doubt on the prior investigation. Judges and some former rioters pushed back, insisting on the facts. Yet the state\'92s narrative power had shifted. What could not be controlled was at risk of being drowned out.\
\
There were, amid this rush, a few points of resistance. Federal judges in multiple jurisdictions blocked the birthright citizenship order, at least temporarily, and did so in strong language that reaffirmed the Fourteenth Amendment. A coalition of states and cities went to court to defend the children who would have been stripped of automatic citizenship. Labor unions sued to stop the reclassification of civil servants. Police unions and some Republican lawmakers criticized the January 6 pardons. Senators from the president\'92s own party opposed his nominee for defense secretary, citing allegations of abuse and extremist views. In California, the governor signed a $2.5 billion wildfire relief package and insisted that disaster aid should not be conditioned on voter ID laws or other political demands. These acts did not reverse the week\'92s damage, but they showed that not every institution had yielded.\
\
Still, the balance of power moved decisively. Executive authority expanded through emergency declarations and mass pardons. The civil service was politicized through Schedule F and targeted firings. Oversight was weakened by the purge of inspectors general and the freezing of civil rights enforcement. Law was used to protect allies and intimidate opponents. Immigration and citizenship were recast in ways that narrowed who belongs and who is protected. Public health and science were muzzled. Wealth and proximity to the president bought influence over policy and regulation. Memory and narrative were curated from the top. Each of these developments might, in another era, have been a major story on its own. Compressed into a single week, they formed a coherent picture of a system being refitted to serve one man and his circle rather than the public.\
\
Looking ahead, several fault lines are already in motion. The lawsuits over birthright citizenship will test whether the courts can still enforce constitutional limits when the executive branch openly defies them. The union challenge to Schedule F will determine whether the civil service remains a professional corps or becomes a partisan instrument. The new January 6 subcommittee will shape how millions of Americans understand the attack on the Capitol and the legitimacy of the 2020 election. The review of FEMA, coupled with threats to abolish it and to condition disaster aid on state voting laws, will reveal whether federal support in crises remains a shared safety net or becomes a tool of political discipline. The pause in foreign aid and the withdrawal from the WHO will show how far the administration is willing to go in trading long\uc0\u8209 term global stability for short\u8209 term ideological gain. None of these questions can be answered in a single week, but the direction of travel is clear.\
\
At the close of this period, the Democracy Clock stands at 7:45 p.m. That time does not mean collapse is inevitable or that repair is impossible. It does mean that the space for repair has narrowed. The breaches recorded this week were not only in policy but in the moral floor that undergirds a republic. Restraint gave way to impulse. Ethics yielded to expedience. Truth was treated as a tool rather than a duty. Good faith in the basic fairness of the system eroded as law was bent to favor some and punish others. Stewardship of institutions and public resources was subordinated to private gain and partisan advantage. The shell of elections, courts, and agencies remains, but the habits that make them instruments of self\uc0\u8209 government are under strain. Future weeks will show whether the remaining guardrails can hold, or whether this first week of the new term will be remembered as the moment when the walls began to close in. For now, the record is clear: power moved closer to midnight.\
\
## Week 1 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Joe Biden commuted Leonard Peltier\'92s life sentence to home confinement (2025-01-20): Biden\'92s commutation for Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier responded to long\uc0\u8209 standing concerns about prosecutorial misconduct and fairness in a politically charged case, signaling use of clemency to correct perceived injustices in federal punishment.\
\
2. President Joe Biden issued pre\uc0\u8209 emptive pardons to family members and Trump critics (2025-01-20): Biden pardoned relatives and officials such as Milley, Fauci, and January 6 investigators to shield them from anticipated reprisals, highlighting how presidential clemency can be used defensively in polarized transitions of power.\
\
3. President Joe Biden publicly declared the Equal Rights Amendment to be law despite lack of ratification (2025-01-20): Biden and Harris\'92s assertion that the ERA was already law, contrary to constitutional procedure, illustrated how symbolic executive claims can blur public understanding of formal amendment requirements.\
\
4. President Joe Biden commuted the federal death sentences of 37 prisoners (2025-01-23): Biden\'92s mass commutation of federal death sentences curtailed use of capital punishment but drew criticism over victim notification, underscoring tensions between executive mercy and procedural expectations in criminal justice.\
\
5. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second term as President of the United States (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s second inauguration, framed by false claims about the 2020 election and government \'93weaponization,\'94 marked a transfer of executive power that immediately set a confrontational tone toward institutions and prior policies.\
\
6. President Donald Trump launched personal cryptocurrencies and promoted them while in office (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s launch and promotion of TRUMP and MELANIA coins, with large reserved stakes, created direct avenues for private and foreign actors to enrich the sitting president, eroding norms against personal profiteering from public office.\
\
7. President Donald Trump used executive orders to declare national emergencies on the southern border (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s border emergency declarations, despite low crossings, enabled troop deployments and wall funding while sidestepping Congress, normalizing emergency powers for routine policy goals and straining separation of powers.\
\
8. President Donald Trump issued executive orders and directives to end or restrict birthright citizenship (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s orders redefining citizenship for U.S.-born children of non\uc0\u8209 citizens directly challenged the Fourteenth Amendment, testing whether a president can unilaterally narrow constitutional guarantees of belonging.\
\
9. President Donald Trump issued sweeping pardons and commutations for January 6 participants and ordered related prosecutions dropped (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s mass clemency for over 1,500 January 6 defendants, including violent offenders, and direction to dismiss pending cases removed legal consequences for an attack on Congress, weakening deterrence against future assaults on elections.\
\
10. President Donald Trump pardoned anti\uc0\u8209 abortion activists convicted under the FACE Act (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s pardons for FACE Act violators signaled tolerance for obstructing reproductive health clinics, weakening enforcement of federal protections for patients and providers targeted by ideological violence.\
\
11. President Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road online drug marketplace (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s full pardon for Ross Ulbricht overturned a high\uc0\u8209 profile life sentence for running a massive illicit marketplace, raising questions about consistency in federal punishment for complex, tech\u8209 mediated crime.\
\
12. President Donald Trump threatened or moved to abolish or radically shrink FEMA (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s repeated suggestions to abolish or sharply curtail FEMA, and to condition disaster aid on political or policy compliance, treated emergency relief as a bargaining chip rather than a neutral public safeguard.\
\
13. President Donald Trump publicly suggested prosecuting former President Biden (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s public hints that Biden could face prosecution blurred the line between neutral law enforcement and political retribution, pressuring prosecutors to treat a predecessor as a target.\
\
14. President Donald Trump used rhetoric to label January 6 offenders as hostages and minimize their violence (2025-01-24): In defending his January 6 pardons, Trump recast rioters as victims of government overreach, reinforcing a narrative that delegitimizes prosecutions for political violence against Congress.\
\
15. President Donald Trump threatened to condition California wildfire aid on voter ID and water policy changes (2025-01-24): Trump\'92s threats to tie disaster relief for California to unrelated voting and water policy demands used federal power to coerce a state\'92s internal choices, undermining neutral administration of aid.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. President Donald Trump restructured federal technology management by creating the Department of Government Efficiency (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s order creating DOGE inside the Executive Office centralized tech modernization under a presidential initiative, raising questions about advisory transparency and the balance between efficiency and independent agency operations.\
\
2. President Donald Trump reinstated Schedule F to reclassify policy\uc0\u8209 influencing civil servants as easily removable (2025-01-20): By reviving and expanding Schedule F, Trump moved thousands of career officials into a category with weak protections, enabling political purges that threaten a neutral, expert civil service.\
\
3. President Donald Trump ordered independent regulatory agencies to align policies and budgets with White House approval (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s directive subordinating independent regulators to presidential review weakened statutory independence designed to insulate economic and safety oversight from direct political control.\
\
4. President Donald Trump rescinded dozens of Biden\uc0\u8209 era executive actions including racial equity and LGBTQ protections (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s mass rescission of 78 Biden orders dismantled federal initiatives on racial equity, climate, and LGBTQ nondiscrimination, rapidly reversing policy baselines set through prior executive action.\
\
5. President Donald Trump revoked COVID\uc0\u8209 19 safety and vaccination mandates for federal employees and contractors (2025-01-21): By canceling prior COVID safety and vaccine orders, Trump shifted federal workplace standards away from centralized public\u8209 health protections, affecting how agencies manage health risks for their workforces.\
\
6. President Donald Trump fired multiple inspectors general across major federal agencies (2025-01-24): Trump\'92s purge of at least a dozen inspectors general removed key internal watchdogs, weakening institutional checks on waste, fraud, and abuse within the executive branch.\
\
7. President Donald Trump removed and reassigned senior career officials at the Department of Justice (2025-01-21): Trump\'92s reshuffling of top DOJ national security and criminal division career leaders risked politicizing prosecutorial priorities and undermining continuity in sensitive enforcement areas.\
\
8. President Donald Trump sidelined about 160 National Security Council career staff (2025-01-22): By marginalizing large numbers of NSC professionals, Trump concentrated foreign\uc0\u8209 policy advice among loyalists, potentially reducing expertise and institutional memory in national security decision\u8209 making.\
\
9. President Donald Trump fired the TSA administrator and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee (2025-01-23): Trump\'92s removal of TSA leadership and its advisory body disrupted established aviation security governance, raising concerns about continuity and politicization of transportation safety oversight.\
\
10. President Donald Trump froze all DOJ civil rights division cases and barred new filings (2025-01-23): The administration\'92s freeze on civil rights litigation halted federal enforcement against discrimination, effectively suspending a core institutional mechanism for protecting vulnerable groups.\
\
11. President Donald Trump delegated broad implementation of politicized executive orders to the Attorney General (2025-01-23): Trump\'92s instruction that the Attorney General operationalize his executive orders blurred the line between independent law enforcement and presidential political agendas.\
\
12.
