Week 30 centers on Washington, DC, where a manufactured “crime emergency” allowed the White House to seize effective control of local policing, deploy National Guard troops, and threaten homeless residents with expulsion. The move briefly subordinated the Metropolitan Police Department to federal command and signaled that disfavored jurisdictions—especially sanctuary cities and Democratic strongholds—could be disciplined by force. Legal and political pushback in DC and California forced partial retreats, but only after the precedent was set. Beyond the capital, immigration enforcement grew harsher and more arbitrary, citizenship more stratified, and security forces more clearly aligned with regime narratives than with public safety. Inside the state, statistical agencies and the civil service were purged and repopulated with loyalists, while economic and environmental policy tilted further toward crony capitalism and privatization. Courts, activists, and some governors resisted, yet the Democracy Clock’s shift to 11:14 p.m. records a tightening circle around democratic life.
