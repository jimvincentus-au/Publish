# Week 11 Appendix: Emergency Economics as Governance

This was a structurally heavy week of democratic backsliding, dominated by three converging dynamics: consolidation of executive economic and security power, systematic hollowing of the civil service and knowledge institutions, and aggressive manipulation of elections and information. Trump’s declaration of a trade “national emergency” and sweeping, donor-skewed tariffs (wk011-138, -139, -170, -171, -172, -173, -176, -201, -237) sharply increased unchecked executive authority and normalized emergency governance. Musk’s DOGE-driven mass layoffs and agency shutdowns (wk011-135, -095, -130, -134, -211) gutted HHS, USAID, Voice of America, and regulators like CFPB (wk011-169), entrenching politicized, privatized administration. Universities and cultural institutions were coerced through funding threats and content control (Columbia, Harvard, Smithsonian, DEI teacher grants: wk011-001, -005, -006, -091, -127, -128, -220, -221, -235), while immigration and border powers were weaponized against activists and migrants using dubious criteria and propaganda (wk011-011, -016, -041, -074, -110–113, -122, -148, -149, -157). Simultaneously, elite money and disinformation flooded key judicial and legislative contests (Musk in Wisconsin, SAVE Act, voting EO: wk011-013, -020–022, -077, -105, -193, -216, -219). Courts and some legislators mounted notable resistance (wk011-011, -015, -071, -072, -108, -142, -144, -184, -222), but the net structural pressure this week clearly favored authoritarian drift.
