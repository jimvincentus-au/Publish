\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 39 of Trump\'92s second term shows how a democracy can darken without the clock visibly moving. The public time stays at 7:59 p.m., yet the machinery beneath is rewired. Inspectors general are fired, civil servants purged, and hiring centralized in political hands, turning a professional bureaucracy into a patronage system. Law is redeployed as a weapon: RICO probes, politicized IRS plans, and indictments of prominent critics blur justice with retribution, while a new national security directive recasts beliefs and protests as potential terrorism. Shutdown-era layoffs and selective funding freezes punish disfavored regions and vulnerable populations. Emergency logic spreads through talk of the Insurrection Act, militarized immigration raids, and covert lethal operations abroad. Press and universities face gag rules and conditional funding, even as some refuse to bend. Courts block the worst abuses but are simultaneously delegitimized. The week\'92s tiny numerical shift masks a dense consolidation of power that will be hard to unwind.\
