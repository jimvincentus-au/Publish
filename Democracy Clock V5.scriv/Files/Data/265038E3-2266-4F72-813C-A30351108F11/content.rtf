In Week 15, the pattern that had been forming since the start of the term came into sharp relief. The presidency no longer moved mainly through speeches or bills, but through a dense web of orders, purges, and targeted favors that rewired how the state itself worked. Immigration, climate, education, media, and the civil service were not separate policy arenas; they were the chosen levers for a single project. Law was bent into a tool, neutral offices were turned into instruments of loyalty, and the channels through which citizens learn and remember were pulled closer to the center of power. The week\'92s events did not yet feel like a break in the story of American democracy, but they did feel like the moment when the new rules of the game became clear. That mattered.\
\
At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:51 p.m. It ends Week 15 at the same public time, 7:51 p.m., though the underlying measure edged 0.3 minutes closer to midnight. The face of the clock did not move, but the gears inside did. That small shift reflects how much changed without a single spectacular crisis. Executive power widened again through emergency declarations and structural orders. The Justice Department was pushed further into partisan work. Public media and universities were pressed to choose between independence and survival. At the same time, courts in several cases held a line on deportations, data grabs, and funding freezes, and state officials and legislators used what tools they had to resist. The week\'92s net effect was not a lurch but a tightening. More domains of life now ran through channels that answered first to the president and his allies.\
\
The clearest expression of law as weapon came in the way the administration used its formal powers. Trump\'92s executive order declaring a national border emergency opened the door to troop deployments and a militarized buffer zone along the southern border, where migrants could now be charged simply for entering a strip of land transferred to the Army. In parallel, he defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, an eighteenth\uc0\u8209 century wartime statute, to detain and expel Venezuelan migrants labeled as gang members or \'93enemy\'94 nationals. These moves did not just change immigration enforcement; they asserted that the president could invoke emergency law to create rights\u8209 light zones inside the country. When a federal judge in Texas ruled that the Alien Enemies Act did not authorize such deportations, and another Trump\u8209 appointed judge permanently blocked its use against Venezuelans in the Southern District of Texas, the rulings underscored how far the White House had tried to stretch the law. The courts slowed the project in those districts, but they did not erase the message that the executive now claimed the right to treat whole categories of people as outside normal protections. That claim will not be forgotten.\
\
The same pattern appeared in the mass pardons and selective clemency that surfaced this week. Trump\'92s earlier order pardoning about 1,500 January 6 defendants and directing the Justice Department to dismiss remaining cases had already signaled that violence on his behalf would not be punished. Now, testimony from the former pardon attorney revealed that he had also wiped away more than a billion dollars in debts and fines owed by white\uc0\u8209 collar criminals and a cryptocurrency exchange, including a $100 million penalty. The pardon of Michele Fiore, convicted of using donations for a police officer\'92s statue to pay for cosmetic surgery, fit the same mold. So did the administration\'92s quiet decision to drop investigations and lawsuits against 89 corporations, many of them donors. In each case, the formal power of clemency and prosecutorial discretion was used not to correct injustice but to erase consequences for allies. Law became a shield for those close to power and a sword for those who opposed it. That is how deterrence dies.\
\
The Justice Department itself was being remade to serve that purpose. Inside Main Justice, the civil rights division lost about 70% of its lawyers as more than 250 attorneys left or were reassigned, while new leadership redirected the unit away from enforcing voting and anti\uc0\u8209 discrimination laws and toward priorities like voter\u8209 fraud investigations and limits on transgender rights. At the same time, Trump appointees removed all senior civil servants from the voting section and ordered active cases dismissed, effectively gutting federal voting\u8209 rights enforcement. Elsewhere in the department, Pam Bondi paused prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and shut down the cryptocurrency unit that had been pursuing North Korean hackers and other fraudsters. These were not isolated management choices. Together with the executive order ordering a DOJ investigation of ActBlue, the Democratic fundraising platform, and the directive to seek sanctions against pro bono immigration lawyers accused of \'93coaching\'94 asylum seekers, they marked a structural turn. The department that once claimed to stand above politics was being repurposed to protect corporate and political allies and to pursue the president\'92s opponents.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the main laboratory for this new law\uc0\u8209 as\u8209 weapon approach. Over the course of the week, ICE deported U.S. citizen children to Honduras and Mexico, including a four\u8209 year\u8209 old with stage\u8209 four cancer sent without medication, and separated mothers from their U.S.\u8209 born children without allowing them to arrange care or speak to lawyers. ICE also deported a U.S. citizen child with a rare cancer and his mother, and removed Honduran and Cuban mothers with their American children. In New Orleans and Colorado, women who had complied with routine ICE check\u8209 ins were suddenly detained and expelled with their children, while a federal judge expressed alarm at the deportation of a citizen child without due process. At the same time, ICE began targeting unaccompanied immigrant children and their sponsors through so\u8209 called welfare checks that doubled as intelligence\u8209 gathering for deportation or prosecution, a practice advocates described as \'93backdoor family separation.\'94 These actions were not random cruelty. They showed how the administration was willing to treat even citizens\'92 rights as contingent when immigration policy and political messaging demanded it.\
\
The deportation of Kilmar \'c1brego Garc\'eda, sent to a Salvadoran prison in defiance of a 2019 court order, crystallized the clash between executive will and judicial authority. When a federal judge ordered the government to facilitate his return, the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release citing domestic abuse allegations to justify refusing, and the administration argued that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction. Senators responded by demanding a report on wrongful deportations to El Salvador, and public opinion polls showed broad support for \'c1brego Garc\'eda\'92s return, including among some Republicans. Yet the president\'92s stance remained defiant, and his response was described by observers as authoritarian. In parallel, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene so it could revoke Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans, despite lower\uc0\u8209 court rulings that blocking TPS termination was necessary to prevent harm to individuals and the economy. The message was that court orders and humanitarian protections were obstacles to be worked around, not limits to be respected. That message was heard far beyond immigration courts.\
\
Even as the executive pushed outward, the courts did not simply yield. The Supreme Court issued an emergency order blocking the deportation of Javier Salazar, a 19\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old Venezuelan with no criminal record who had been swept up under the Alien Enemies Act. A federal appeals court restored an injunction against firing 90% of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\'92s staff, and another appeals court upheld an order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Social Security records. Judges also halted the transfer of migrants to other agencies, including the Pentagon, as a way to avoid due process, and forced the administration to restore funds to Radio Free Europe and a Maine child nutrition program that had been frozen over transgender sports policies. In Texas, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the Alien Enemies Act could not be used to deport Venezuelans in his district, and a Trump\u8209 appointed judge in the same region permanently barred such use. These decisions did not reverse the broader trend, but they showed that parts of the judiciary still understood themselves as a check, even as they faced open attacks from the president. That understanding is now under strain.\
\
Those attacks grew louder this week. At a rally in Michigan, Trump denounced \'93communist radical\uc0\u8209 left judges\'94 for blocking his immigration and national security policies, accusing them of overstepping and endangering the country. His rhetoric came against a backdrop of threats and harassment directed at judges, which Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson addressed directly in a speech in Puerto Rico. She warned that such intimidation was an attack on democracy and the rule of law itself, and that it risked undermining the Constitution. Her remarks echoed earlier rebukes from other justices and attorneys general who had been suing to block executive orders since the start of the term. The clash between the branches was no longer a quiet institutional dispute; it had become a public struggle over whether judges would be allowed to stand between citizens and the state. That is a different kind of test.\
\
While law and courts were being bent, the machinery of the civil service was being hollowed out and politicized. Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continued its ideological purge under the banner of savings. At the Department of Energy\'92s Loan Programs Office, 60% of staff were cut, undermining efforts to build domestic rare\uc0\u8209 earth mining capacity just as China imposed export controls on those minerals. DOGE halted disbursement of funds from the bipartisan infrastructure act, slowing green\u8209 energy and modernization projects, and prepared a \'93reduction in force\'94 at the National Park Service that could cut 1,500 jobs. At the Peace Corps, a second deferred resignation program invited staff to leave as part of a broader downsizing of foreign aid and development agencies. At the Federal Aviation Administration, a secretive DOGE project called \'93Project Lift\'94 required NDAs from staff, shielding a multimillion\u8209 dollar communications overhaul from normal scrutiny. These moves did not simply shrink government. They replaced neutral capacity with opaque, loyalty\u8209 driven structures.\
\
The president\'92s own orders deepened that transformation. An April order reclassified tens of thousands of federal roles as political appointments, allowing the White House to remove career officials deemed disloyal and replace them with loyalists. Another order made independent regulators like the SEC and FTC answerable to the White House for policy priorities and budgets, eroding their statutory independence. A separate directive shifted more disaster\uc0\u8209 relief responsibility to states, signaling that federal support would be more conditional and less automatic. Together, these orders moved the system away from a professional, rules\u8209 bound bureaucracy and toward a patronage state in which access to jobs, relief, and regulatory favor depended more on alignment with the president\'92s agenda than on law or merit. That shift is hard to reverse.\
\
At the same time, the boundary between governance and personal enrichment blurred further. A new private club in Georgetown, \'93Executive Branch,\'94 backed by Donald Trump Jr. and a major donor, offered half\uc0\u8209 million\u8209 dollar memberships to business and tech moguls seeking private access to cabinet members and senior advisers. In parallel, the president promoted a contest tied to his $TRUMP cryptocurrency token, promising that the top holders would receive a White House tour, a dinner, and an exclusive reception. Because Trump and his companies held large stakes in the token and collected transaction fees, every speculative surge in its price enriched him and his circle. Senators asked the Office of Government Ethics to investigate, warning that the scheme allowed foreign governments, contractors, and individuals under investigation to buy influence without disclosure. When combined with the dropping of corporate cases and the pardons of wealthy fraudsters, these ventures made crony capitalism indistinguishable from governance. The price of access was now literal.\
\
Information and media became another front in this consolidation. The administration barred the Associated Press from the presidential pool and Oval Office events, even after a court ruling in AP\'92s favor, and extracted a $15 million payment from ABC under threat of a libel suit. It launched legal assaults on CBS and the Des Moines Register, and threatened to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS. On May 1, Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding NPR and PBS, accusing them of bias. The FCC, led by a Project 2025 author, opened investigations into those public broadcasters with an eye toward further defunding. At the same time, the White House unveiled \'93White House Wire,\'94 a news\uc0\u8209 style website hosted on official servers that aggregated only favorable coverage, press releases, and social media posts from senior officials. Attorney General Bondi rescinded DOJ policies that had protected journalists from subpoenas, allowing prosecutors to compel reporters to reveal sources and jail them for contempt. These steps did not shut down independent media, but they starved it of resources, increased its legal risk, and built a state\u8209 aligned alternative.\
\
Education and public memory were pulled into the same orbit. The president signed an order to dismantle the Department of Education, and a follow\uc0\u8209 on order directed the secretary to begin that process, even though full closure would require Congress. The administration also banned diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the federal government and moved to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented and some legal immigrants, an order a judge temporarily blocked as \'93blatantly unconstitutional.\'94 In Oklahoma, the state board of education approved new social studies standards that embedded pro\u8209 Trump conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and dramatically increased references to the Bible, while downplaying the accomplishments of Joe Biden and omitting the separation of church and state. The superintendent pushed through last\u8209 minute changes without giving board members time to read the 400\u8209 page document, and falsely claimed they were based on public input. The curriculum will cost taxpayers at least $33 million and will teach students to analyze \'93discrepancies\'94 in an election whose results have been repeatedly upheld. At the federal level, the Department of Education opened investigations into Harvard and Chicago\'92s Black Student Success Plan, threatening funding for race\u8209 based programs, while the administration fired Biden appointees, including Doug Emhoff, from the Holocaust Museum board. These moves signaled a drive to control how the next generation understands both recent elections and the country\'92s hardest histories.\
\
Religion was drawn closer to the state as well. At a National Prayer Day event in the Rose Garden, Trump declared that America must be \'93One Nation Under God\'94 to be great and boasted that the White House Faith Office now operated directly from the West Wing. On May 1, he created a Religious Liberty Commission by executive order, tasked with advising the Faith Office and the Domestic Policy Council on religious\uc0\u8209 liberty policy and producing a report on threats to religious freedom. The commission, which includes figures like Dr. Phil McGraw, sits alongside a broader campaign to reshape education and civil\u8209 rights enforcement in ways that favor Christian nationalist narratives. In Oklahoma\'92s new curriculum, nearly fifty mentions of the Bible appear from first grade onward, and references to church\u8209 state separation vanish. The combined effect is to use religion as a source of legitimacy and a policy tool, rather than as a sphere protected from state entanglement. That is a profound change in posture.\
\
The environmental and climate sphere showed how far administrative agencies could be turned toward private interests. Over the first hundred days of the term, the administration took more than 140 actions to roll back environmental regulations, fast\uc0\u8209 track fossil\u8209 fuel extraction, and weaken pollution controls. This week, those actions came into focus. The administration dismissed nearly 400 contributors to the National Climate Assessment, halted climate data collection at NOAA, FEMA, and the Department of Agriculture, and pulled datasets from public access. It withdrew a USDA rule that would have forced poultry companies to keep salmonella below a safety threshold, despite more than a million infections a year. It canceled environmental justice initiatives, closed offices, and terminated climate and conservation grants that had targeted low\u8209 income and minority communities. New orders eased restrictions on oil and gas extraction and exports, granted tariff exemptions to fossil\u8209 fuel firms, and halted approvals of new solar and wind projects on federal lands and waters, contributing to the cancellation or downsizing of $8 billion in clean\u8209 energy investments. The Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to block their climate superfund laws and argued that the Clean Air Act preempted state climate suits against oil companies, while Puerto Rico dropped its own climate case under evident pressure. These steps did not just favor one industry. They reoriented the state\'92s scientific and regulatory apparatus away from public health and climate resilience and toward short\u8209 term extraction.\
\
Economic policy and trade were used in similar ways, with costs pushed onto workers and consumers while insiders found ways to profit. The president\'92s 145% tariff on Chinese goods, imposed under a national emergency declaration, began to bite. Shipping volumes at major ports were expected to fall by more than a third, UPS announced layoffs of 20,000 workers and the closure of 73 facilities, and Tesla raised prices in Canada due to retaliatory tariffs. Factory orders and shipments fell, and the housing market faced higher costs for imported materials. GDP contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter, the first such decline in three years, and unemployment claims rose to their highest level since February. Yet in public statements and a televised cabinet meeting, Trump blamed the downturn on his predecessor and insisted that the economy would soon \'93boom.\'94 He pressured Amazon to abandon plans to show tariff impacts on product prices, and the company complied. The administration proposed ending federal taxation on tips instead of raising the minimum wage, a move that would do little for many low\uc0\u8209 wage workers and could encourage employers to shift more jobs into tipped positions. At the same time, Republicans advanced a budget framework that extended tax cuts, funded border defenses, and contemplated ending taxation of overtime and Social Security payments, while imposing historic cuts on Medicaid, SNAP, and other social programs. Work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP were floated again, despite evidence that most beneficiaries already work or cannot work. The architecture of inequality was being tightened, even as the official story insisted that tariffs and tax changes were acts of national strength.\
\
Against this backdrop, the administration\'92s treatment of information and memory took on added weight. Climate data was deleted or withheld, public broadcasters were defunded and investigated, and a state\uc0\u8209 run news site promoted only favorable narratives. At the same time, Oklahoma\'92s curriculum rewrote recent electoral history, and federal investigations into race\u8209 based school programs and Harvard\'92s Law Review signaled that certain kinds of inquiry and support would be punished. The Holocaust Museum board was reshaped, and a historic civil\u8209 rights church in Memphis, Clayborn Temple, suffered a devastating fire whose cause was still under investigation. These events were not all connected by direct orders, but they shared a direction. Institutions that had preserved uncomfortable truths or supported dissenting voices were either weakened, politicized, or brought under closer executive influence.\
\
There were, throughout the week, signs of resistance and civic resilience. Democratic leaders held a 12\uc0\u8209 hour sit\u8209 in on the Capitol steps to protest the Republican budget\'92s cuts to childcare, health research, education, housing, and support for the elderly. Senate Democrats prepared marathon floor speeches to mark the first hundred days of the term and to lay out what they saw as its failures. Governors like J.B. Pritzker called for mass protests against MAGA policies, and earlier in the month millions had joined \'93Hands Off!\'94 rallies across all fifty states. Senators demanded reports on wrongful deportations and pushed ethics inquiries into the $TRUMP coin contest. Harvard University refused to accept federal demands to change its governance and admissions in exchange for funding, asserting its independence. Courts in multiple jurisdictions blocked or narrowed executive actions, from deportations to DOGE\'92s data access to funding freezes. These acts did not reverse the structural changes, but they showed that other centers of power still existed and that the story of the term was not yet settled.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 15, several processes were already in motion. The Senate Finance Committee was preparing to consider the nomination of Rodney Scott as Customs and Border Protection commissioner, despite allegations that he helped cover up a death in custody. The Supreme Court had been asked to intervene on Venezuelan TPS and on DOGE\'92s access to Social Security records. The Religious Liberty Commission had just been created and would begin advising on policy. The FCC\'92s investigations into NPR and PBS and its broader information\uc0\u8209 collection reviews would shape the regulatory environment for media and telecommunications. Oklahoma\'92s new curriculum would roll out in the 2025\'9626 school year, embedding its narratives into classrooms. And the administration\'92s orders to dismantle the Department of Education, reclassify civil\u8209 service roles, and shift disaster relief to states would move from paper to practice as agencies implemented them. Each of these tracks will test how much resistance remains.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock still read 7:51 p.m., but the meaning of that hour had changed. The formal trappings of democracy remained: elections scheduled, courts sitting, Congress in session, a free press still publishing. Yet more of the system\'92s inner workings now ran through channels that answered to loyalty and wealth rather than to law and neutral expertise. Executive orders had become the main engine of change, emergency powers the preferred tool, and the Justice Department a central instrument of political strategy. Public media, universities, and schools were being pressed to align their narratives with the regime or face loss of funding. Climate science and civil\uc0\u8209 rights enforcement were being stripped back, even as courts and states fought to preserve fragments of the old order. That is why the clock\'92s internal measure moved, even if the hands did not. Week 15 matters not because it brought a single dramatic break, but because it showed how, in the space of a hundred days, the walls around democratic practice can close in without yet touching the outer shell. The official time at the close of the period remains 7:51 p.m., but the room for error has grown smaller, and the work of holding the line has grown harder.\
