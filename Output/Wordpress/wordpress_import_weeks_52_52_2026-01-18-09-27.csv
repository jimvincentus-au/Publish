<blockquote class=""dc-subtitle""><em>A federal immigration surge turns Minnesota into a test site for domestic force, legal impunity, and curated memory, even as states and courts push back.</em></blockquote>

<p>The fifty-second week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single order or speech. It unfolded instead as a convergence: immigration enforcement on a war footing, economic power wielded as personal leverage, and the information system bent to protect both. The center of gravity was Minnesota, where a federal operation turned a metropolitan region into something close to occupied territory. Around that center, law, money, and narrative were adjusted to make such operations easier to launch, harder to question, and safer for those who carried them out.</p>
<p>At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:11 p.m. By the end of this week, it had moved to 8:12 p.m., a net shift of 0.2 minutes. The numerical change was small, but it captured a dense set of moves: federal agents using lethal force and mass detention in a disfavored state, the Justice Department recasting civil-rights questions as assaults on federal officers, and the executive branch tightening its grip on oil revenues, tariffs, and health coverage. The clock moved because these actions widened what the presidency could do without effective oversight, and because the institutions meant to check that power were forced into reactive, fragmented resistance.</p>
<p>The story in Minnesota began with scale. Operation Metro Surge sent thousands of ICE and Homeland Security agents into Minneapolis–St. Paul, conducting door-to-door raids at homes and businesses, stopping people on the street, and demanding papers. Within days, more than 2,400 people had been detained, deported, or transferred, including visa holders and refugees. The effect on daily life was immediate. Immigrant neighborhoods emptied. Families stayed indoors. The presence of federal agents, armored vehicles, and chemical munitions gave the operation the feel of a domestic deployment rather than routine law enforcement.</p>
<p>The killing of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, turned that sense into a concrete case. Good was shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross during an enforcement action, in circumstances that quickly became contested. Federal officials described a dangerous encounter. Community witnesses and early video suggested a different story. What was not in dispute was the outcome: a woman dead in her own city, killed by a federal officer operating under a mandate that had never been debated as war.</p>
<p>The surge did not stop with Good’s death. ICE detained four members of the Oglala Lakota Nation in Minnesota, deported a gravely ill detainee in a vegetative state who soon died, and recorded four migrant deaths in custody in the first ten days of the year. In Texas, a medical examiner ruled that another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, had died of asphyxia at an ICE facility, raising the possibility of homicide. Taken together, these events showed an enforcement system where loss of life was no longer an aberration but a recurring feature.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s political and legal response was unusually broad. The state attorney general and the Hennepin County attorney opened their own investigation into Good’s killing, directly challenging federal claims of “absolute immunity” for ICE agents. The state, along with Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued to halt Operation Metro Surge, alleging unconstitutional stops, detentions, and racial profiling. The ACLU of Minnesota filed a class-action suit describing agents stopping Somali and Latino residents on the basis of race, demanding papers, and making arrests without probable cause. In their filings and public statements, state officials described the operation as a “federal invasion.”</p>
<p>Other states moved in parallel. Illinois sued over a separate DHS operation, Operation Midway Blitz, accusing federal agents of warrantless detentions and the use of chemical weapons. California enacted laws allowing state authorities to arrest federal agents for specified abuses committed on state soil. Illinois created an accountability commission to gather complaints about federal immigration officers. New York’s attorney general launched a portal for residents to submit evidence of federal agent misconduct. These measures did not stop the Minnesota surge, but they marked a shift. States were building their own structures to monitor and, where possible, constrain federal enforcement.</p>
<p>Congressional and public reactions added another layer. Representative Shri Thanedar announced plans for an Abolish ICE Act, citing deaths in custody and the Good shooting as evidence that the agency’s current form was untenable. Democratic lawmakers held a field hearing in St. Paul titled “Kidnapped and Disappeared,” taking testimony from families and advocates about the raids’ impact and warning DHS to preserve records. Polling showed that 46 percent of Americans now supported abolishing ICE, a remarkable figure for an agency created less than a quarter century earlier. Latino focus groups expressed regret over supporting Trump, citing both immigration tactics and economic conditions.</p>
<p>Even as this backlash grew, federal officials worked to limit oversight. ICE and facility operators near Minneapolis blocked members of Congress from visiting a detention center, despite a judge’s ruling that they had a right to enter. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a policy restricting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities more broadly. These moves, combined with the scale and tactics of the raids, made Operation Metro Surge look less like law enforcement under scrutiny and more like a federal occupation insulated from outside eyes.</p>
<p>If the Minnesota surge showed federal power on the ground, the handling of Renee Good’s case showed how law could be used to protect that power. The Justice Department chose to frame the shooting primarily as an assault on a federal officer, rather than as a potential civil-rights violation. That framing shaped everything that followed. The FBI took over the investigation, sidelining Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and limiting local prosecutors’ access to evidence. Reports emerged that agents had left and possibly altered the crime scene and were withholding body-camera footage. The focus of federal inquiry was on whether Good had attacked Ross, not on whether Ross had unlawfully used lethal force.</p>
<p>Inside the Justice Department, this approach triggered open resistance. Senior officials in the Civil Rights Division resigned after being barred from investigating the Good killing as a civil-rights matter. Federal prosecutors in Minnesota also stepped down rather than carry forward a case they believed had been politically redirected. Their departures reduced the department’s capacity to enforce civil-rights law and signaled that internal checks were being overridden when they conflicted with the protection of federal agents.</p>
<p>The department’s formal decisions reinforced that message. DOJ declined to open a civil-rights investigation into the Good shooting, stating there was “no basis” for such a probe, even as protests and resignations mounted. It later refused to treat another ICE shooting in Minneapolis as a civil-rights case, again prioritizing the protection of agents over scrutiny of their conduct. In both instances, the Justice Department’s choices told federal officers that lethal force against civilians, in the context of immigration enforcement, would not be examined through the lens of rights.</p>
<p>State-level investigations in Minnesota and Oregon stood in contrast. Oregon’s attorney general opened a probe into border agents’ shooting of two undocumented people in Portland, asserting state interest in policing federal use of force. Minnesota’s own investigation into Good’s death continued despite federal obstruction. These efforts showed that some jurisdictions were willing to contest the Justice Department’s narrative, but they did so from a position of limited access to evidence and constrained jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The broader pattern was clear. Law enforcement authority at the federal level was being used to shield ICE and DHS from accountability, while those inside the system who pushed for civil-rights enforcement were marginalized or removed. The justice system’s formal structures remained in place, but their practical function shifted: from neutral arbiter between state and citizen to defender of the state’s agents against the citizen.</p>
<p>Alongside these legal maneuvers, the administration worked to shape how the public understood Good’s death and the Minnesota operation. Within days of the shooting, President Trump endorsed a baseless claim that Good was part of a paid left-wing agitator network. Vice President J.D. Vance and DHS released a short, tightly framed video of the incident, first leaked to a partisan outlet, that portrayed Ross as a victim and obscured key context. The 47-second clip became the centerpiece of official accounts, even as longer footage and witness statements suggested a more complex scene.</p>
<p>The smear campaign intensified. Trump and Vance described Good and her wife as “domestic terrorists,” asserting that she had tried to run over an agent with her car, despite video evidence that undercut that claim. These statements were not slips. They were repeated, amplified through friendly media, and used to justify both the shooting and the broader operation. In this telling, Good was not a citizen killed by the state; she was an enemy whose death confirmed the need for harsh measures.</p>
<p>Information control extended beyond this one case. ICE resisted disclosing its updated use-of-force policies, heavily redacting documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. The Pentagon imposed new conditions on reporters covering defense matters, prompting mainstream journalists to resign from the Pentagon press corps and opening space for pro-administration influencers. The Department of Defense moved to assume editorial control over Stars and Stripes, the long-standing independent newspaper for service members, stripping away safeguards that had protected its autonomy.</p>
<p>Government messaging also carried signals aimed at a narrower audience. The Labor Department and the White House used rhetoric and imagery in official social-media posts that unions and observers said echoed Nazi slogans and white supremacist literature, including a cartoon referencing “Which way, Greenland man?” These cues did not change policy on their own, but they helped define who was seen as inside the national “we” and who was cast as other, and they tied that identity politics to the administration’s enforcement agenda.</p>
<p>Journalists who challenged these narratives faced direct pressure. The FBI raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson in a leak investigation, seizing her devices. Officials insisted she was not a target, but the search sent a clear message to her sources and to other reporters with deep federal contacts. At the White House podium, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attacked a reporter who questioned ICE’s defense of the Good shooting as a “left-wing activist,” framing critical inquiry as partisan hostility. Inside CBS News, staff raised concerns that a report on Ross’s condition relied too heavily on politicized leaks, highlighting the difficulty of covering a story where the government controlled both the evidence and the narrative.</p>
<p>Despite this pressure, the information battle was not one-sided. More than a thousand “ICE Out For Good” protests and vigils took place across the country, drawing attention to deaths in custody and the Minnesota raids. Portland saw demonstrations against border patrol shootings, with arrests that underscored the risks of protest. Polling and focus groups suggested that public support for the administration’s immigration tactics was eroding, even among some who had backed Trump in 2024. The narrative field narrowed, but it did not close.</p>
<p>While law and information were being bent around the Minnesota operation, the Justice Department and allied agencies were also turning their tools on other critics and independent institutions. The raid on Natanson’s home was one example. Investigations into lawmakers were another. DOJ opened probes into Representative Elissa Slotkin and three other House Democrats over a video in which they reminded troops of their duty to refuse illegal orders. Military leadership launched inquiries into Senator Mark Kelly’s public comments on the same subject, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally censured Kelly and ordered a review of his retirement grade.</p>
<p>These actions blurred the line between legitimate concern about civil-military relations and the use of investigative power to chill oversight. The lawmakers’ statements were about the law of armed conflict and the obligation to disobey unlawful commands, a core principle of military ethics. Treating those statements as potential misconduct or criminal incitement inverted the usual hierarchy. Instead of civilian leaders scrutinizing the executive’s use of force, the executive and its appointees were scrutinizing legislators for raising questions.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve became another target. President Trump publicly threatened criminal charges against Fed Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates and building renovations. The Justice Department subpoenaed the Fed and opened a criminal investigation into Powell’s testimony about renovation spending. Prosecutors in Washington, D.C., went so far as to threaten indictment, a move widely seen as leverage to force rate cuts. Global central banks issued a joint statement supporting Powell and warning against political interference, an extraordinary step that underscored how far the confrontation had gone.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Justice Department rolled back guidance discouraging federal prosecutions for simple cannabis possession, reopening a channel of enforcement that had disproportionately affected marginalized communities. It sued 23 states and the District of Columbia to obtain sensitive voter information, including birth dates and partial Social Security numbers, under the banner of cleaning voter rolls. A federal judge in California pushed back, ruling that DOJ was not entitled to that data, but the attempt itself showed a willingness to centralize voter information in federal hands.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of aggressive, selective enforcement, some courts and states still managed to assert limits. Judge Amir Ali ordered the restoration of whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid’s security clearance, finding that its revocation had been politically motivated. Judge William Young prepared a protective order for noncitizen academics targeted over pro-Palestinian speech, checking the use of immigration powers to silence political expression. The Supreme Court, in an earlier decision that took effect this week, rejected Trump’s claim of authority to deploy federalized National Guard troops in Illinois, reinforcing a boundary on domestic military use.</p>
<p>Other judicial moves cut the other way. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that had freed Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, holding that lower courts lacked jurisdiction over his claims and deferring to restrictive immigration statutes. The Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to Trump’s global trade tariffs imposed under emergency economic powers, and revived a Republican lawsuit over Illinois’s mail-in ballot deadline, expanding candidate standing to contest election rules. These cases did not resolve this week, but their acceptance signaled a Court willing to revisit the scope of presidential economic authority and to open new avenues for litigation over voting.</p>
<p>Legislative efforts to rein in war powers and alliance policy met mixed fates. The Senate advanced, then narrowly defeated, a resolution that would have required congressional approval for further military action in Venezuela, preserving broad presidential discretion. Lawmakers considered a Save NATO Act to limit the president’s ability to attack NATO allies unilaterally, reflecting concern that war powers could be used to undermine core alliances. House Republicans moved to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt for defying Epstein-related subpoenas, a step that intersected with a separate struggle over transparency in that case.</p>
<p>The economic dimension of executive power was most visible in foreign policy. The administration seized control of Venezuelan oil and its revenues without full congressional involvement, declaring a national emergency that blocked repayments and placed the assets under U.S. control. Trump then announced a 25 percent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, using access to the American market as a coercive tool against third parties. These moves extended emergency economic powers into long-term foreign asset management and trade policy, with little legislative input.</p>
<p>The handling of Venezuelan oil revenues linked foreign policy to domestic patronage. The first U.S. sale of seized Venezuelan crude went to Vitol, a firm whose executive had heavily funded Trump-aligned political committees. Executive orders shielded the proceeds from courts and creditors, making it difficult to trace how the money would be used. At the same time, the Trump Organization entered multi-billion-dollar development deals with Saudi-backed Dar Global in Diriyah and Jeddah, deepening financial ties between the president’s business and a foreign government with major security interests.</p>
<p>Domestically, economic levers were used in ways that blended policy and pressure. The administration refused to extend Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, risking coverage losses for many and reshaping access to health care without new legislation. New federal dietary guidelines emphasized red meat and full-fat dairy, raising questions about industry influence on public health advice. A Labor Department rule change lowered wages for foreign farmworkers, and the Trump Organization moved to hire foreign workers at those reduced rates, illustrating how regulatory shifts could directly benefit connected employers.</p>
<p>Tariff policy produced its own feedback. Reports showed that manufacturing jobs had declined despite high tariffs, undercutting claims that protectionism was reviving industry. Polling found widespread public disapproval of Trump’s economic performance. Meanwhile, China and Canada finalized a $1 trillion strategic trade partnership that included tariff cuts on electric vehicles and agriculture, signaling a shift in global trade alignments that could marginalize U.S. influence. These developments did not alter the administration’s course, but they framed the costs of its approach.</p>
<p>The fight over transparency and archives ran through several of these domains. Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requiring the Justice Department to release investigative records. DOJ ignored the law’s deadlines, prompting Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie to ask a federal judge to appoint a special master and monitor to enforce compliance. Judge Paul Engelmayer ordered DOJ to explain its noncompliance. When the department finally acted, it released less than one percent of the files, in defiance of the statute’s clear intent.</p>
<p>ICE’s secrecy around its use-of-force policies fit the same pattern. Even under FOIA, the agency heavily redacted documents, leaving the public and oversight bodies with little sense of when agents were authorized to use lethal force. At the same time, DOJ sought detailed voter data from states, and the General Services Administration proposed adding fraud indicators to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. The National Archives invited public comment on records disposition schedules, a routine step that took on added weight in a climate where politically sensitive records were at risk of being sealed, sanitized, or destroyed.</p>
<p>The Epstein struggle intersected with partisan maneuvering. House Oversight Chair James Comer moved to hold the Clintons in contempt for defying subpoenas related to Epstein, even as DOJ itself failed to release the broader set of files mandated by law. The release of former special counsel Jack Smith’s testimony, in which he asserted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Trump’s criminal schemes, added another layer of unresolved accountability to the public record. Together, these threads showed a government that demanded transparency from some actors while resisting it fiercely where elite networks and donors were implicated.</p>
<p>Amid these pressures, some institutional brakes still functioned. Judges restored a whistleblower lawyer’s clearance, protected noncitizen academics’ speech, and rejected federal demands for intrusive voter data. States sued to stop abusive enforcement operations, created commissions to monitor federal agents, and passed laws asserting their own authority to hold those agents accountable. Congress honored Capitol Police for defending the legislature on January 6 and considered measures to constrain presidential war powers and alliance policy, even when those measures failed.</p>
<p>What to watch next is already on the calendar. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear cases on Trump’s emergency-based tariffs and on state bans of transgender girls in girls’ sports, and has revived litigation over Illinois’s mail-in ballot deadline. The Epstein transparency lawsuits will return to court as DOJ’s minimal release is tested against the statute. Minnesota’s and Illinois’s suits against DHS, along with the ACLU’s class actions, will move through the federal courts, forcing judges to decide how far federal immigration operations can go inside the states.</p>
<p>This week’s movement on the Democracy Clock was modest in minutes but heavy in content. Federal agents acted as a domestic security force in a disfavored state, backed by a Justice Department that recast civil-rights questions as threats to federal officers. The executive branch seized foreign assets, threatened global tariffs, and withheld health subsidies, using economic tools in ways that blurred policy with personal and political gain. Information about these actions was curated, leaked, and withheld to favor the state’s narrative, while journalists and lawmakers who challenged that narrative faced raids and investigations. Courts and states did not stand aside, but their responses were uneven and often reactive. The result was not a dramatic rupture, but a deepening of patterns: law as weapon, security forces aligned with power, and memory shaped by those who hold both.</p>

Internationally, the Venezuela operation, seizure of oil revenues, and open talk of invading or annexing Greenland, backed by tariffs and NATO-skeptical rhetoric, reveal an expansionist, transactional foreign policy that fuses crony capitalism with militarized leverage (traits 1, 10, 38, 40, 56).

<p><em>A federal immigration surge turns Minnesota into a test site for domestic force, legal impunity, and curated memory, even as states and courts push back.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an acute convergence of authoritarian tools around immigration enforcement, foreign adventurism, and information control. The Minneapolis–St Paul ICE surge, the killing of Renee Nicole Good, and subsequent shootings are the central axis: federal agents deployed at unprecedented scale, used lethal force, altered crime scenes, blocked state investigators, and were shielded by DOJ decisions and smear campaigns. That cluster drives heavy pressure on traits 4, 8, 9, 11, 41, 42, 43, 47, 50 and 53. Parallel moves—threatening the Fed chair with criminal charges, politicized probes of lawmakers and whistleblower counsel, and the FBI raid on a Washington Post reporter—extend the weaponization of law and security institutions (traits 1, 4, 6, 14, 18, 22, 23, 42). Internationally, the Venezuela operation, seizure of oil revenues, and open talk of invading or annexing Greenland, backed by tariffs and NATO-skeptical rhetoric, reveal an expansionist, transactional foreign policy that fuses crony capitalism with militarized leverage (traits 1, 10, 38, 40, 56). There is meaningful resistance—state lawsuits, ACLU class actions, congressional field hearings, impeachment articles, and mass protests—but these operate as reactive brakes against a rapidly consolidating executive-centered regime.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>

</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a policy restricting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities: Noem’s policy limiting members of Congress from visiting ICE facilities curtailed legislative oversight of detention conditions, weakening a key accountability mechanism over federal enforcement operations.

<li>US Senate unanimously approved installing a plaque honoring Capitol Police for January 6 defense: The Senate’s unanimous decision to honor Capitol Police for defending Congress on January 6 symbolically reinforced institutional memory of the insurrection and support for those who protected the legislature. (2026-01-12)</li>
<li>House Judiciary Committee Republicans released the transcript of former special counsel Jack Smith’s testimony: Publishing Jack Smith’s testimony, which asserted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Trump’s criminal schemes, injected detailed allegations into the public record and congressional discourse about presidential accountability.
