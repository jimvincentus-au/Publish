This move is part of a broader regulatory push to industrialize the Alaskan Arctic. The Department of Interior has signaled it would adopt a management plan to open 82% of the NPR-A to oil drilling, and the BLM has already rescinded three Biden-era documents protecting the reserve.",

This decision aligns with Hegseth's admiration for Christian nationalist pastor Doug Wilson, who has expressed views minimizing the brutality of slavery.",
