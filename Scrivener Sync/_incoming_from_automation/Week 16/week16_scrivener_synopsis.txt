Week 16 of Trump’s second term shows a regime that has learned to hollow out democracy from within its formal shell. The administration deepens its grip on the civil service, public health, environmental protection, and immigration enforcement, using budget cuts, mass firings, and new authorities to weaken oversight and expand detention. Public media and cultural institutions are defunded, repurposed, or threatened, while regulatory pressure nudges private outlets toward partisan accommodation. Law is wielded against critics, from a Newark mayor protesting ICE to New York’s attorney general, even as federal judges in scattered cases defend due process, elections, and press freedom. States pursue climate, tax, and social policies that partially counter federal overreach. Crony capitalism flourishes through foreign‑linked Trump business ventures and tariff‑driven leverage. Civil society protests, legal mobilizations, and some court rulings keep the Democracy Clock from moving closer to midnight—but only by operating at full stretch against entrenched, systemic breaches of the civic covenant.
