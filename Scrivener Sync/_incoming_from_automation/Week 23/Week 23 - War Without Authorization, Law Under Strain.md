The week of June 21 to June 27, 2025, was marked by a sharp consolidation of executive power, aggressive use of state authority, and a deepening erosion of democratic norms and institutions. The Democracy Clock, a calibrated measure of the health and resilience of democratic governance, advanced by nearly two minutes, moving from 9:54 p.m. to 9:56 p.m. This shift reflects a systemic intensification of threats to democratic oversight, accountability, and civil liberties. The week’s events reveal a pattern of unilateral executive action, weaponization of law enforcement, judicial acquiescence to elite interests, and a pervasive assault on truth and transparency. These developments are not isolated incidents but interconnected moves that collectively tighten the grip of power while weakening the checks and balances essential to democracy.

The previous time of 9:54 p.m. already indicated a precarious state of democratic health, with significant vulnerabilities in oversight and institutional independence. The new time of 9:56 p.m. signals a further narrowing of democratic space, driven by a series of executive overreaches, legal manipulations, and information distortions. The unilateral military strikes ordered by President Trump against Iranian nuclear facilities without congressional authorization exemplify this trend. These actions bypassed constitutional war powers, sidelined legislative scrutiny, and set a precedent for unchecked presidential military engagement. The invocation of emergency powers to justify immigration and tariff policies further entrenched executive dominance, normalizing governance by decree and diminishing legislative authority.

The military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites—Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan—were conducted with advanced weaponry and hailed by the administration as a “spectacular military success.” Yet intelligence assessments and international agencies like the IAEA expressed caution, noting the difficulty in verifying the extent of damage and the retention of significant Iranian uranium stockpiles. The administration’s dismissal of intelligence community assessments, including public repudiation of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s testimony, politicized national security information and undermined institutional credibility. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s aggressive media confrontations and the hiring of partisan influencers to manage Department of Defense communications further illustrate efforts to control the narrative and discredit independent journalism.

Domestically, the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to suppress protests against immigration enforcement marked a troubling militarization of civil society. This deployment, challenged by California’s lawsuit and criticized by local officials, reflects a shift in civil-military relations where security forces prioritize elite preservation over public defense. ICE’s intensified raids across immigrant communities, including wrongful arrests of U.S. citizens and long-term residents, fostered widespread fear and disrupted daily life, including access to healthcare. The Department of Homeland Security’s use of propaganda to encourage citizen informants and the concealment of law enforcement identities during raids eroded transparency and accountability, deepening mistrust between communities and the state.

Legal mechanisms were increasingly wielded as tools of political repression. Charges against opposition figures such as Representative LaMonica McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, coupled with judicial rebukes of prosecutorial misconduct, reveal a pattern of law enforcement used to intimidate dissent. The Department of Justice’s internal whistleblower disclosures about plans to ignore court orders on deportations and the nomination of Emil Bove, a controversial official implicated in politicized prosecutions and retaliation against staff, highlight the erosion of judicial independence and the rule of law. The Supreme Court’s rulings permitting expedited deportations to unsafe third countries, limiting judicial power to issue nationwide injunctions, and upholding restrictive laws on reproductive healthcare and educational content further align the judiciary with elite and executive interests, constraining democratic protections.

Congressional oversight faced significant obstacles. The Department of Homeland Security’s new rules requiring advance notice for congressional visits to immigration detention centers contravened federal law and weakened legislative checks. The administration’s cancellation of classified briefings on military strikes and the limitation of intelligence sharing with Congress undermined transparency and accountability. Legislative processes were marked by procedural constraints and partisan conflicts, as Senate parliamentarian rulings blocked key provisions in budget reconciliation bills, complicating efforts to address social welfare and taxation. Public protests against Medicaid cuts and immigration policies met with arrests and military suppression, reflecting a narrowing of civic space for dissent.

The information environment was marred by disinformation and manipulation. President Trump’s calls for special prosecutors to investigate unfounded election fraud claims perpetuated distrust in electoral integrity. High-ranking officials misrepresented intelligence assessments to justify military action, while government media outlets like Voice of America were repurposed for presidential messaging, blurring lines between independent journalism and propaganda. The administration’s attacks on the press, including arrests of journalists covering protests and public denunciations of media outlets, contributed to a hostile climate for investigative reporting. Legal rulings permitting AI companies to use copyrighted works without full author consent raise concerns about intellectual property rights and the commodification of knowledge.

Economic and regulatory policies reflected entrenched elite influence and disregard for public welfare. The Trump Organization’s launch of “Trump Mobile” raised conflict-of-interest questions, while significant budget cuts proposed for the National Cancer Institute threatened critical health research. Legislative efforts to secure tax breaks for fossil fuel companies and the passage of tax-and-spending bills favoring wealthy interests underscore the dominance of elite lobbying. Regulatory agencies issued numerous guidances and approvals affecting environmental standards, drug development, and food safety, but these actions occurred within a broader context of deregulation and privatization. Progressive political figures like Zohran Mamdani proposed ambitious economic reforms in New York City, signaling local resistance and alternative visions amid national retrenchment.

The week also witnessed troubling developments in civil rights and social cohesion. The resignation of the University of Virginia president under federal pressure to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion programs exemplifies the politicization of education and suppression of dissent. Islamophobic attacks and calls for deportation against Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani reveal the intersection of political rhetoric and racialized persecution. Community-led mutual aid efforts in Los Angeles in response to ICE raids demonstrate resilience and solidarity amid state repression. Lawsuits challenging wrongful detentions and inadequate medical care for immigrant families highlight ongoing struggles for justice and humane treatment.

In sum, the week’s events reveal a democracy under significant strain, with systemic breaches across all six pillars of the Civic Covenant: character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship. Executive overreach, judicial complicity, legislative dysfunction, and information manipulation have converged to erode foundational democratic norms and institutions. While pockets of resilience remain—such as judicial rulings protecting free speech and state-level legal challenges—the overall trajectory points toward increased concentration of power, diminished accountability, and shrinking civic space. The Democracy Clock’s advance to 9:56 p.m. reflects this deepening crisis, underscoring the urgency of institutional reforms and renewed commitment to democratic principles to prevent further deterioration.

This week matters in the larger arc of the term as it marks a clear intensification of structural erosions rather than symbolic or isolated incidents. The unilateral military action without congressional approval, the normalization of emergency powers, and the weaponization of law enforcement against political opponents collectively demonstrate a shift toward authoritarian governance practices. The judiciary’s alignment with elite interests and the suppression of dissenting voices in media and academia further entrench these trends. The Democracy Clock’s movement is a calibrated response to these systemic changes, signaling that the margin for democratic repair is narrowing. The time now stands at 9:56 p.m., a reminder that while democracy is not yet lost, it faces formidable challenges that require vigilant defense and proactive restoration.

## Week 23 Events

### Power and Authority

President Donald Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate baseless 2020 election fraud claims (2025-06-21): Trump’s demand for a special prosecutor to re-investigate the 2020 election despite lack of evidence extended efforts to delegitimize certified results and normalize using prosecutorial tools against electoral outcomes he opposed.

4. President Donald Trump threatened Iran and its regime with further force and called for regime change (2025-06-22): Trump’s public threats of overwhelming retaliation and calls for regime change in Iran framed U.S. power as a tool for coercive overthrow abroad, heightening risks of open-ended conflict driven by executive rhetoric.

5. President Donald Trump renewed public attacks on Representative Thomas Massie for introducing a War Powers Resolution (2025-06-23): Trump’s attacks on a Republican lawmaker for challenging his Iran strikes signaled intolerance for intra-party oversight and sought to deter legislators from exercising independent war-powers scrutiny.

11. President Donald Trump pressured Israel over ceasefire violations while publicly claiming total success of Iran strikes (2025-06-26): Trump’s mix of public rebukes of Israel and exaggerated claims about Iran strike success highlighted personalized, media-driven diplomacy that can destabilize alliances and obscure factual assessments.

12. President Donald Trump called for cancellation of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s corruption trial (2025-06-26): Urging that Netanyahu’s bribery and fraud trial be canceled invited U.S. interference in another country’s judicial process and signaled disregard for independent corruption prosecutions.

13. President Donald Trump terminated trade discussions with Canada in retaliation for its Digital Services Tax (2025-06-26): Halting trade talks with Canada over its tax on U.S. tech firms used economic leverage to punish a democratic ally’s domestic policy choice, politicizing trade relationships.

14. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and state executive officials used emergency powers to seize Everglades land for a large migrant detention camp (2025-06-27): Florida’s emergency land seizure for the ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention site bypassed normal processes and empowered the executive to override local control for a controversial incarceration project.

15. Florida Attorney General and Governor Ron DeSantis advanced plans for a massive Everglades tent detention facility for migrants (2025-06-27): Designing a remote, militarized migrant camp in the Everglades expanded carceral infrastructure for immigration enforcement, raising concerns about humane treatment and executive control over vulnerable populations.

16. U.S. Department of Homeland Security leadership ordered ICE to dramatically increase daily immigrant arrests to 3,000 (2025-06-24): Setting aggressive arrest quotas for ICE shifted federal power toward mass detention of non-criminal immigrants, straining due process and detention conditions.

Trump administration determined that California’s trans-inclusive sports policies violate Title IX and threatened enforcement (2025-06-25): Declaring California’s trans athlete policies unlawful and threatening sanctions used federal civil-rights enforcement to restrict protections for transgender students.


### Institutions and Governance

1. Members of Congress from both parties criticized Trump’s Iran strikes as unconstitutional and advanced War Powers responses (2025-06-22): Lawmakers’ statements and resolutions challenging unauthorized Iran strikes sought to reassert Congress’s constitutional role over war and check unilateral executive military action.

2. U.S. House of Representatives voted to table impeachment articles over unauthorized Iran strikes (2025-06-24): By shelving impeachment articles tied to war-powers violations, the House signaled limited willingness to use its strongest accountability tool against executive overreach in foreign policy.

3. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled key GOP reconciliation provisions out of order under Senate rules (2025-06-25): The parliamentarian’s decisions striking noncompliant Medicaid and court-limiting provisions from the budget bill upheld procedural constraints on majority power in fast-track legislation.

9. Trump Department of Justice sued Maryland’s federal judges over an order delaying deportations after legal challenges (2025-06-26): By suing an entire federal bench for protecting immigrants’ access to courts, DOJ escalated conflict with the judiciary and questioned judges’ authority to constrain executive removals.

10. Trump Department of Justice attempted to dismiss corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for policy cooperation (2025-06-25): Efforts to trade away a bribery case for immigration-policy support blurred the line between law enforcement and political bargaining, undermining equal application of justice.

11. Senior DOJ official Emil Bove purged DOJ and FBI personnel involved in January 6 prosecutions under a Trump order (2025-06-25): Firing staff who pursued January 6 cases recast accountability for an attack on Congress as misconduct, politicizing prosecutorial careers and weakening deterrence for anti-democratic violence.

12. Trump administration used emergency declarations and the Alien Enemies Act to justify aggressive immigration and energy policies, prompting multiple lawsuits (2025-06-23): Expansive emergency claims to speed fossil-fuel projects, deport migrants, and federalize the National Guard triggered coordinated state and civil challenges to reassert statutory and constitutional limits.

13. Federal courts in multiple jurisdictions issued rulings checking Trump administration actions on immigration, emergency powers, and infrastructure funding (2025-06-24): Decisions ordering return of a wrongfully deported man, blocking misuse of the Alien Enemies Act, and forcing release of EV charger funds showed courts acting as counterweights to executive overreach.

14. Federal judiciary and Supreme Court allowed DHS to proceed with contested immigration policies via emergency stays (2025-06-23): High-court stays in DHS v. D.V.D. and related cases enabled the administration’s restrictive immigration rules to operate while litigation continued, shifting practical power toward the executive.

15. Supreme Court of the United States allowed deportations of migrants to third countries with limited process (2025-06-24): By permitting deportations to non-origin countries, including conflict zones, with minimal additional hearings, the Court expanded executive discretion over life-altering removal decisions.

16. Supreme Court of the United States curtailed lower courts’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policies (2025-06-27): Rulings limiting universal injunctions, including in Trump v. CASA and the birthright citizenship case, reduced judges’ capacity to halt contested executive orders nationwide, strengthening presidential leverage during litigation.

17. Supreme Court of the United States ruled Medicaid patients cannot sue to enforce free-choice-of-provider rights, enabling Planned Parenthood exclusions (2025-06-26): By closing a private right of action for Medicaid enrollees, the Court made it harder for low-income patients to challenge state decisions that defund specific providers like Planned Parenthood.

18. Supreme Court of the United States upheld key Affordable Care Act preventive-services provisions while enhancing health secretary control over expert panels (2025-06-27): Affirming ACA preventive-care mandates but confirming the health secretary’s power to appoint and remove task force members increased the risk that scientific guidance could be politicized by future administrations.

19. Supreme Court of the United States disbarred former Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro after his conviction for 2020 election interference (2025-06-26): Disbarring Chesebro for his role in overturning the 2020 election signaled professional consequences for legal strategies that attack electoral certification processes.

20. Federal courts and litigants handled multiple suits over immigration enforcement, grant cancellations, and federal employee rights (2025-06-24): Cases challenging ICE courthouse arrests, grant cancellations, and an order stripping collective bargaining rights for federal workers showed courts as venues for contesting executive labor and immigration policies.

23. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured vaccine and preventive-services advisory bodies with ideologically aligned appointees (2025-06-25): Firing established vaccine advisers and installing skeptics on ACIP and related panels shifted expert bodies toward political loyalty, risking capture of health policymaking institutions.

24. Trump administration and University of Virginia leadership secured the resignation of UVA’s president as part of a DOJ settlement over DEI policies (2025-06-27): Forcing UVA’s president out to resolve a federal investigation into diversity programs showed how law-enforcement leverage can be used to reshape university governance and policy.

2. Zohran Mamdani and New York City policymakers advanced an ambitious redistributive economic platform including rent freezes, higher taxes on the wealthy, and major public investments (2025-06-24): Mamdani’s proposals for rent freezes, higher top-end taxes, large-scale housing construction, free buses, city-owned groceries, and universal child care outlined a model of urban governance that shifts resources toward public goods and lower-income residents.

3. President Donald Trump publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over interest-rate policy (2025-06-23): Trump’s criticism of Powell for not cutting rates pressured an independent central bank to align monetary policy with presidential preferences, risking politicization of macroeconomic management.

5. Stephen Miller and Trump White House held a significant personal stake in Palantir while it received major ICE contracts (2025-06-25): Miller’s Palantir holdings alongside a $30 million ICE contract to the firm highlighted potential conflicts of interest where immigration policy and surveillance procurement intersect with insider profit.

6. Trump administration and Florida officials approved and funded large new migrant detention facilities in Florida and California (2025-06-25): Federal and state commitments to high-cost detention centers, including ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ and a CoreCivic-run California site, expanded a carceral infrastructure that channels public funds to private contractors.

7. Trump administration proposed deep cuts to National Cancer Institute funding in the 2026 budget (2025-06-26): A proposed 37% reduction to NCI’s budget threatened to slow cancer research and clinical trials, shifting the burden of disease onto patients and undermining long-term public health investment.

8. California Legislature and Governor Gavin Newsom expanded film and TV tax credits to $750 million annually (2025-06-27): California’s large increase in entertainment tax incentives aimed to retain industry jobs but also illustrated how major sectors secure favorable treatment through targeted fiscal policy.

9. Trump administration and congressional Republicans pursued a reconciliation bill with historic Medicaid cuts and corporate-friendly tax changes (2025-06-26): The budget package’s deep Medicaid reductions and fossil-fuel tax breaks reflected priorities that favor capital over low-income beneficiaries and constrain social safety nets.

10. Department of Homeland Security restored previously frozen counter-terrorism grants to several major cities (2025-06-26): Reinstating security funding to Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco reversed earlier punitive freezes and underscored how federal grants can be wielded or withheld in intergovernmental disputes.

### Civil Rights and Dissent

1. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and DHS leadership intensified nationwide immigration raids and mass detentions, including in Los Angeles (2025-06-21): Aggressive ICE operations, often by masked agents, produced record detention levels, wrongful arrests of citizens, and widespread fear that curtailed daily life and access to healthcare in immigrant communities.

2. ICE and CBP agents used forceful tactics in high-profile arrests of immigrants and U.S. citizens (2025-06-24): Cases involving Narciso Barranco, Andrea Velez, and others showed armed pursuits, beatings, and opaque detentions that raised concerns about excessive force, racial profiling, and due process violations.

3. ICE and private detention operators presided over deaths and severe medical neglect in immigration custody (2025-06-22): The in-transit death of Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado and the loss of Iris Monterroso-Lemus’s pregnancy in detention highlighted life-threatening conditions and inadequate care in an expanding detention system.

4. Department of Homeland Security and ICE arrested and charged local and federal officials during immigration oversight and protest activities (2025-06-21): The arrests and charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep.

5. Trump Department of Justice and ICE arrested a Honduran mother and her children at a courthouse and detained them despite serious illness (2025-06-27): The detention of ‘Ms Z’ and her son with leukemia after a court visit, now challenged in federal court, exemplified how enforcement at judicial venues can endanger vulnerable families and chill access to justice.

6. Trump administration and DHS announced and began building large new immigrant detention facilities in Florida and California (2025-06-25): Plans for ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ and a CoreCivic-run California mega-jail expanded long-term capacity to confine migrants in remote, contested environments, raising human-rights and oversight concerns.

7.

8. Federal courts and judges ordered releases or returns of immigrants detained or deported under contested circumstances (2025-06-24): Orders freeing Mahmoud Khalil and Kilmar Abrego Garcia and requiring the return of Jordin Melgar-Salmeron showed judicial willingness to correct abusive or defiant deportation practices.

9. Senior DOJ official Emil Bove and Trump DOJ allegedly directed subordinates to ignore court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (2025-06-24): Whistleblower accounts that Bove urged flights to proceed despite restraining orders suggested deliberate defiance of judicial authority in service of aggressive deportation goals.

10. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and DHS detained a long-term Iranian resident and other Iranians amid heightened tensions (2025-06-27): The arrest of Mandonna Kashanian and other Iranians with no criminal records during the Iran crisis raised fears of nationality-based targeting and collective punishment.

19. Supreme Court of the United States limited Medicaid patients’ ability to sue over provider choice, affecting Planned Parenthood access (2025-06-26): By foreclosing suits to enforce free-choice-of-provider rights, the Court made it easier for states to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid, constraining reproductive healthcare for low-income people.

20. Trump administration and RFK Jr. withdrew U.S. funding from global vaccine alliance Gavi (2025-06-25): Cutting support for Gavi over alleged suppression of vaccine dissent undermined international immunization efforts and signaled alignment with anti-vaccine narratives.

21.

22. Planet Over Profit, Mijente, and NYPD saw six protesters arrested at a Palantir office demonstration over ICE surveillance contracts (2025-06-26): Arrests at a protest targeting Palantir’s deportation software highlighted tensions between civil society opposition to surveillance capitalism and policing of direct action.

23. Vance Boelter and law enforcement carried out and investigated the politically motivated murders of Minnesota lawmakers (2025-06-21): The killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and attacks on other officials underscored the growing threat of political violence against elected representatives.

24. Quinnipiac and other pollsters reported strong public disapproval of Trump’s deportation policies and support for legalization (2025-06-21): Polling showing majority opposition to mass deportations and support for legalization suggested a widening gap between public preferences and the administration’s immigration agenda.


### Information, Memory and Manipulation

1. Trump administration and senior national security officials contradicted and sidelined U.S. intelligence assessments on Iran’s nuclear program while promoting Israeli claims (2025-06-23): Dismissing domestic intelligence in favor of disputed foreign reports to justify war blurred fact-finding with advocacy and echoed patterns of manipulated pre-war intelligence.

2. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted Iran strikes were a spectacular success despite intelligence showing limited impact (2025-06-25): The White House’s insistence on total success, in defiance of DIA and IAEA assessments, exemplified narrative management that can mislead the public about the consequences of war.

3. Trump administration restricted congressional access to classified information after an Iran-strike leak (2025-06-25): Tightening control over classified briefings in response to a leak curtailed legislative oversight and concentrated informational power within the executive.

4.
