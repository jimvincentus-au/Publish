By Week 25 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been building for months came into sharp relief. Power was no longer drifting; it was being seized. The presidency and the Supreme Court moved in concert to lift restraints, while the machinery of immigration, policing, and trade was bent toward the will of one man and his circle. At the same time, the state itself was being hollowed out: scientists, diplomats, weather forecasters, and civil servants were cut back or purged, even as floods, epidemics, and wars pressed in. The week\'92s events did not just add more incidents to an already long list. They showed how different strands\'97executive orders, court rulings, budget choices, and raids on city streets\'97were now woven together into a new kind of regime.\
\
At the start of Week 25, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:02 p.m., already well into the danger hours. By the end of the period, it read 8:06 p.m., a movement of 4.7 minutes. On the surface, that may seem a small shift. It is not. In this system, each minute reflects a structural change in how power is held and used. This week, the clock moved because the presidency gained formal immunity from criminal law, because courts cleared the way for mass purges of the civil service, because emergency powers and tariffs were used as personal tools, and because immigration enforcement became a stage for militarized spectacle and fear. There were pockets of resistance\'97a federal judge blocking the birthright citizenship order, another preserving Planned Parenthood\'92s Medicaid funding for now, the Supreme Court upholding a block on Florida\'92s harsh immigration law\'97but these were eddies in a current that was running the other way.\
\
The most consequential development came from the Supreme Court. In Trump v. United States, the justices held that a former president enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his \'93conclusive and preclusive\'94 constitutional authority, and presumptive immunity for all official acts. In the same span of days, the Court also limited nationwide injunctions, making it harder for lower courts to halt executive policies across the country, and lifted injunctions that had frozen Trump\'92s plans for mass federal layoffs. Together, these rulings did not merely interpret law; they rewrote the practical balance of power. A president who can act with broad criminal immunity, whose policies are harder to block, and whose workforce purge can proceed while challenges are pending, is a president who stands increasingly above the law. The winners here were the executive and those aligned with it. The losers were Congress, ordinary plaintiffs, and the idea that no one is beyond legal reach. The effect was structural and systemic, not symbolic.\
\
Those rulings landed in an administration already pressing its advantage. Trump fired the director of the National Security Agency and his deputy after receiving a loyalty list from an outside influencer, and purged six National Security Council staffers on similar grounds. These were not routine personnel changes. They signaled that core security posts would be filled and emptied based on personal loyalty rather than expertise. At the same time, an executive order declared that foreign policy power rests solely in the president, narrowing the space for congressional and institutional checks on war, diplomacy, and sanctions. When Trump ordered a military strike on Iran without seeking congressional approval, and when he halted and then selectively resumed weapons shipments to Ukraine, those moves sat atop this new doctrine. The presidency was no longer just stretching its reach. It was claiming sole ownership of entire domains.\
\
The same pattern appeared in domestic policy. Trump blocked more than $6 billion in congressionially approved funding for after-school and summer programs, asserting control over the power of the purse and disrupting services for children. He used a national emergency declaration to impose tariffs, bypassing the legislature\'92s constitutional role over trade. He limited the classified information shared with Congress, further weakening oversight. In each case, the formal rules still existed, but the practice shifted: law became something to be bent or sidelined when it conflicted with executive aims. The trait the Democracy Clock tracks as \'93law is a weapon, not a limit\'94 moved because law was used to target opponents and vulnerable groups, while legal constraints on the presidency were loosened or ignored.\
\
Congress, for its part, mostly acted as a transmission belt. Republicans pushed through a nearly 1,000-page budget reconciliation bill that made the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations permanent, cut $890 billion from Medicaid and $230 billion from SNAP, and poured $170.7 billion into immigration enforcement, including $51.6 billion for border walls and a 265% increase in ICE\'92s detention budget. The law is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Trump signed it and then told the country it was \'93the most popular bill ever signed,\'94 despite polling that showed broad disapproval. Here, the legislature functioned less as a deliberative body and more as a stage for partisan performance. Policy outcomes favored capital, contractors, and enforcement agencies over labor and the poor. The tax code and spending priorities were reshaped to make inequality a feature, not a flaw.\
\
The civil service suffered a coordinated blow. The Supreme Court\'92s stay on injunctions allowed Trump\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 workforce order to go forward, clearing the path for hiring freezes and large-scale reductions in force across 19 agencies. The State Department announced plans to lay off nearly 15% of its domestic staff, then began issuing termination notices to more than 1,300 employees in \'93rolling RIFs.\'94 Cuts and dysfunction hit the National Security Council, where key officials were blindsided by Pentagon moves. At the National Weather Service, more than 600 employees were laid off or pushed into early retirement, leaving storm-prone offices understaffed. FEMA, under a new rule from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, could not approve contracts over $100,000 without her personal sign-off, delaying Urban Search and Rescue teams for more than 72 hours during catastrophic Texas floods. NASA lost over 2,000 senior staff amid budget cuts, even as Trump installed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as its new head. These were not isolated austerity measures. They were a structural hollowing out of professional governance, replacing expertise with loyalty and leaving key functions brittle.\
\
Nowhere was the new order more visible than in immigration. The administration terminated Temporary Protected Status for roughly 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans who had lived under TPS since Hurricane Mitch, exposing them to deportation after decades in the United States. The Supreme Court issued decisions allowing deportations to third countries with which migrants had little or no connection, a change that directly affected eight men sent to South Sudan. ICE detained a Canadian mother of three US-born children during her green card interview, arrested a long-term resident mother in front of her family in Los Angeles, and held a farmworker activist on an old deportation order. Egyptian-born Imam Ayman Soliman, whose asylum had been terminated on contested \'93material support\'94 grounds, was detained ahead of a hearing. These cases showed how the legal status of noncitizens could be revoked or weaponized, often with little regard for ties, risk, or due process.\
\
Immigration enforcement also became a theater of force. In Los Angeles\'92s MacArthur Park, federal agents, backed by about 90 National Guard troops and armored vehicles, staged a raid that city leaders described as a \'93reality TV spectacle.\'94 No arrests were reported, but the message was clear. Similar operations at cannabis farms in southern California involved chemical munitions and clashes with protesters; one farmworker later died from injuries sustained in a raid that netted 200 arrests. In San Francisco, an unmarked ICE SUV drove through a crowd of protesters outside immigration court, injuring at least one person, while agents in militarized gear used batons and pepper spray. Florida opened a new detention center in the Everglades, \'93Alligator Alcatraz,\'94 where detainees reported maggot-infested food, lack of running water, and exposure to extreme weather. ICE detention centers nationwide were overcrowded and unsanitary, with unrest and escapes. At the same time, DHS dismantled internal watchdog offices\'97the civil rights unit, the detention ombudsman, and the USCIS ombudsman\'97removing channels for complaints and oversight. In this laboratory, security forces did not protect people. They protected power.\
\
The courts did not stand entirely aside. A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked Trump\'92s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents, certified a nationwide class, and paused enforcement for a week to allow appeal. Another court temporarily enjoined the reconciliation bill\'92s provision defunding Planned Parenthood\'92s Medicaid reimbursements, preserving access for patients while constitutional claims are heard. The Supreme Court upheld a block on Florida\'92s SB 4-C, which criminalized undocumented immigrants entering the state, reinforcing federal primacy over immigration law. A federal judge called DOJ cuts to violence-prevention grants \'93shameful\'94 even as he ruled he lacked authority to stop them. These decisions showed that some judges still saw their role as a check, especially where clear constitutional text\'97like the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s citizenship clause\'97was at stake. But their victories were narrow and contingent, and they operated within a legal landscape increasingly tilted toward executive and elite interests.\
\
Information and memory were also contested ground. In Texas, flash floods killed at least 80 people and left dozens missing after nearly a foot of rain fell overnight. Local officials blamed cuts to the National Weather Service and canceled grants for communication improvements; former NWS leaders warned that staffing losses had crippled round-the-clock monitoring. DHS responded by accusing the media of \'93deliberate lying\'94 about the disaster. FEMA restricted its staff\'92s communication with Congress and local officials. At the same time, the administration cut $150 million from NOAA and slashed the National Science Foundation\'92s budget by more than half, undermining research and early-warning systems even as extreme weather intensified. Here, the state\'92s capacity to know and warn was weakened, while its capacity to deflect blame and attack critics was strengthened.\
\
Public health followed a similar arc. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as HHS Secretary, dismissed all 17 members of a key CDC immunization advisory committee, despite earlier pledges not to do so, and replaced them with vaccine skeptics. The new panel\'92s first meeting featured a presentation citing a non-existent study linking thimerosal to brain damage; Kennedy later hired the presenter as an advisor. He went on national television to claim that measles infection provides better immunity than the MMR vaccine and that the vaccine causes harms akin to the disease, statements flatly contradicted by evidence. He launched a large autism research initiative premised on a discredited vaccine link and promoted vitamin-based treatments for measles, urging the CDC to issue guidance on them. Meanwhile, measles cases surged to record levels, and cuts to health research institutes led experts to warn of a \'93brewing health catastrophe.\'94 Medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, sued HHS and Kennedy over these changes, arguing they violated administrative law and endangered public health. The trait the Clock tracks as \'93civic education hollowed out and replaced with market ideology\'94 now had a public health analogue: scientific governance hollowed out and replaced with ideology and profit.\
\
Trade and foreign policy became personal instruments. Trump used emergency powers to impose tariffs, then repeatedly shifted implementation dates, creating confusion for importers and partners. He announced new tariff rates on a long list of countries, including 25% on Japan and South Korea, 35% on Canada, and 50% on copper imports, moves that pushed US copper prices to record highs and threatened supply chains in electronics, autos, and renewable energy. He tied a 50% tariff on Brazilian products explicitly to what he called a \'93witch-hunt\'94 trial against former president Jair Bolsonaro, and launched a trade investigation into Brazil\'92s social media regulations, denouncing its supreme court\'92s content orders as \'93SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship.\'94 These actions used US economic power to pressure foreign courts and shield allied strongmen. At the same time, the administration recommended near-total cuts to democracy promotion programs and slashed USAID health funding in ways researchers estimated would cause more than 14 million deaths over five years, many of them children. Military spending, by contrast, soared past $1 trillion, with more than half of recent Pentagon discretionary funds flowing to contractors. The line between foreign policy, personal grievance, and contractor profit grew thin.\
\
Religion and education were drawn deeper into partisan politics and market logics. The IRS announced that churches could now endorse political candidates without losing their tax-exempt status, effectively opening a tax-subsidized channel for partisan mobilization through religious institutions, while other nonprofits remained constrained. The administration sought judicial approval for this reinterpretation of the Johnson Amendment, raising unresolved constitutional questions. In education, Trump signed an executive order to promote AI in classrooms, and the White House recruited 68 technology companies\'97Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and others\'97to sign a \'93Pledge to America\'92s Youth\'94 and provide funding, tools, and curriculum. The American Federation of Teachers accepted $23 million from AI firms to create a National Academy for AI Instruction. OpenAI and Google offered free access to their tools for students through institutional partnerships. Educators were largely absent from the design. In effect, private companies gained a direct hand in shaping how children learn, and what data is collected about them, under the banner of innovation. Civic education risked being displaced by a curriculum optimized for engagement and product adoption.\
\
Against this backdrop, some local and state actors still used their authority to protect. Florida\'92s governor signed a law banning oil drilling near national estuarine reserves, shielding fragile waterways from spills. California streamlined environmental review to speed infill housing and advanced manufacturing, aiming to ease a severe housing shortage. Congress restored municipal lands to Alaska Native villages and clarified eligibility for Native settlement trusts, bolstering Indigenous self-governance and economic stability. New Mexico sued the US Air Force over PFAS contamination from Cannon Air Force Base, seeking clean water and remediation for poisoned land and livestock. These actions showed that not all governance was captured or hollowed out. But they operated on the edges of a national system whose center of gravity was shifting.\
\
What bears watching after Week 25 is already in motion. The class-action challenge to Trump\'92s birthright citizenship order will move through appeals, testing whether the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s plain text can withstand executive reinterpretation. The lawsuits against RFK Jr.\'92s vaccine policies and advisory panel changes will determine whether administrative law can still enforce scientific standards in public health. The DOJ\'92s suit against California over transgender athletes, and its subpoenas to gender-affirming care providers, will shape the legal landscape for trans rights and medical practice. The IRS\'92s new church-endorsement policy will face judicial scrutiny, with implications for the boundary between religion and electoral politics. And the State Department\'92s rolling layoffs, now cleared by the Supreme Court, will continue to shrink America\'92s diplomatic corps even as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East demand sustained engagement.\
\
By the close of Week 25, with the Democracy Clock at 8:06 p.m., the moral floor of American governance had dropped further. The weekly audit described the direction as \'93collapsing,\'94 and that word fits. Character, in the sense of aligning words with duty, was absent in a president who praised an unpopular law as beloved and used tariffs to punish foreign courts. Ethics, understood as keeping public power separate from private interest, eroded as contractors, donors, and allied industries reaped windfalls from policy choices. Restraint gave way to a willingness to use every available tool\'97emergency powers, pardons, raids, lawsuits\'97whenever they served immediate goals. Truthfulness suffered under disinformation about health, trade, and disasters. Good faith, the habit of honoring the spirit of rules, was undermined by executive orders that contradicted constitutional text and by internal DOJ directives, alleged by a whistleblower, to ignore court orders. Stewardship, the duty to preserve institutions for future generations, was violated in the dismantling of FEMA, the gutting of scientific agencies, and the politicization of the civil service.\
\
Yet the week also showed that the story is not only one of collapse. Judges who blocked the birthright order and preserved Planned Parenthood\'92s funding, state coalitions that challenged militarized raids, medical organizations that sued to defend vaccination, and lawmakers who demanded Epstein files and FEMA accountability all acted from a different ethic. They treated law as a limit, not a weapon; institutions as trusts, not spoils. Their power was limited, and their victories partial, but they kept alive an alternative script for how a democracy might still function.\
\
The official end-of-period time, 8:06 p.m., captures this tension. It marks a real and dangerous advance toward a system in which executive power operates without effective oversight, law serves the strong, and security forces protect the regime rather than the people. It also records that, even in such a week, some lines held: a child born in the United States to undocumented parents still has a claim to citizenship, at least for now; a state cannot unilaterally criminalize mere presence in its territory; a clinic can still accept Medicaid while its fate is argued in court. For future readers, Week 25 will stand as a chapter in which the architecture of American democracy was altered in ways that may prove hard to reverse, and in which the struggle over what kind of country this will be moved further into the open.\
