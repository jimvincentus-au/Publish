  "summary": "This week combines an extraordinary concentration of authoritarian-style executive abuses with a surprisingly strong, though still outgunned, democratic backlash. On the decay side, the Trump administration openly defies court orders on SNAP, stretches war powers in multiple theaters, threatens domestic military deployment under the Insurrection Act, and issues sweeping pardons for 2020 election subversion and other elite allies. Immigration enforcement hardens into a quasi-militarized, partly privatized system targeting immigrants and communities, while Congress funds a vast expansion of ICE detention. Regulatory and patronage scandals\u2014from Extremity Care\u2019s secret ballroom donation to Binance and McMahon pardons\u2014underscore crony capitalism and the conversion of public tragedy and shutdown pain into leverage and profit. Simultaneously, courts and voters mount meaningful resistance: judges order full SNAP funding and push back on politicized prosecutions; Pennsylvania retains a pro-democracy supreme court; Maine voters reject voter ID; Democrats win key governorships and local offices; and California\u2019s Prop 50, though itself a partisan gerrymander, is framed as a counter to earlier abuses. The net structural pressure tilts heavily toward entrenched executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and weaponized law, but the electoral and judicial pushback shows core democratic circuits still firing.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Executive lawlessness and impunity: defiance of court orders, expansive war powers claims, and mass pardons for 2020 subversion collectively normalize a presidency operating above legal constraint.",
    "Weaponized immigration and stratified citizenship: raids, deportations, new detention funding, and data-driven child-tracking deepen a two-tier legal order for immigrants and marginalized communities.",
    "Crony capitalism and regulatory capture: tax cuts, Medicare and prison-telecom decisions, and donor-linked favors show policy being written for insiders while shutdown costs are socialized.",
    "Electoral and judicial counter-mobilization: high-turnout Democratic wins, rejection of voter ID, retention of pro-voting courts, and SNAP rulings demonstrate resilient institutions pushing back against authoritarian drift.",
    "Culture war over knowledge institutions: university compacts, Cornell\u2019s settlement, and passport/sex rulings extend ideological control into campuses, identity documents, and civil rights jurisprudence."
