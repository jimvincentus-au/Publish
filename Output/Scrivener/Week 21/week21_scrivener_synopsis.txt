Week 21 of Trump’s second term compressed many fronts into a single pattern: emergency powers treated as ordinary tools of governance. The administration federalized California’s National Guard over unified state opposition, deployed Marines to Los Angeles, and fused those moves with warrantless ICE raids that swept up immigrants, citizens, and elected officials. Protesters and journalists met flash-bang grenades, drones, and rubber bullets, while members of Congress were denied access to detention centers and, in one case, indicted. Courts pushed back against abuses of the Alien Enemies Act and a sweeping election order, yet rapid appeals and partial compliance blunted their impact. At the same time, the White House escalated pressure on media, universities, and cultural institutions, defunding public broadcasters, censoring DEI content, restoring Confederate symbols, and politicizing civil-rights and scientific bodies. Immigration status, welfare data, and social media became instruments of ideological policing. Massive “No Kings” protests and letters from scientists signaled resistance, but the Democracy Clock inched forward as emergency-style governance became more entrenched.
