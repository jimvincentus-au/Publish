By Week 35, the pattern of the term had come into sharp relief. Power was no longer merely leaning against the guardrails; it was testing how far they would bend before they broke. Immigration raids, media intimidation, and the hollowing out of science and public health all moved in concert, not as isolated abuses but as parts of a single governing style. The week\'92s events showed a White House that treated law as a tool, not a limit, and treated truth and expertise as obstacles to be managed. What had once been extraordinary\'97federal troops in cities, emergency rhetoric over routine policy disputes, the president threatening broadcasters\'97was on its way to becoming ordinary. That normalization, more than any single order or lawsuit, defined the week. It set the tone.\
\
At the start of this period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:58 p.m. It now reads 8:01 p.m., a movement of just over three minutes toward night. The shift is modest in time but heavy in meaning. It reflects not a single coup-like lurch but the accumulation of structural changes: executive defiance of courts and statutes, the weaponization of immigration and criminal law against dissent, the capture of agencies meant to serve the public, and the deliberate reshaping of information and memory. A few court rulings and congressional letters pushed back, but they did not alter the direction of travel. The week\'92s net effect was to deepen executive dominance and to make it harder, not easier, to reverse course later. The system tilted further.\
\
The first major development lay in the expansion of executive power beyond effective oversight. The president again treated emergency powers as a standing option rather than a last resort. He had already ordered National Guard troops into Memphis under the banner of a \'93Memphis Safe Task Force,\'94 despite local leaders noting crime was at historic lows. This week, that deployment was formalized by executive order and echoed in a draft plan to send 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops into New Orleans and Baton Rouge for law enforcement work. At the same time, he threatened to declare a national emergency to seize control of Washington DC\'92s police if the city did not cooperate with mass deportations. These moves blurred the line between civilian policing and military force, and between local autonomy and federal command. They signaled that the president saw emergency framing as a routine way to override resistance. That was the point.\
\
The same disregard for limits appeared in foreign and economic policy. The administration pressed the Supreme Court to rescue its global tariff regime after a lower court had ruled the tariffs illegal under the emergency economic powers statute. When the appeals court blocked his attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, the president went directly to the Supreme Court, asking permission to remove her over unproven mortgage allegations. In parallel, he unilaterally ordered a missile strike on a small boat off Venezuela, killing three people without congressional authorization, and then boasted of the strike without offering evidence. He also signed an order delaying enforcement of the TikTok ban yet again, despite a congressional statute and a Supreme Court ruling requiring the app\'92s shutdown unless sold. In each case, the pattern was the same. When law or institutional design constrained him, he treated those constraints as negotiable suggestions rather than binding rules.\
\
A second development was the deepening use of law as a weapon rather than a neutral framework. The Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi explored bringing RICO charges\'97normally reserved for organized crime\'97against protesters, including pro-Palestinian demonstrators. ICE and DOJ charged California healthcare workers with assaulting federal agents after they tried to shield a patient from an immigration arrest in a surgical center. Bondi announced a civil rights investigation into an Office Depot employee who refused to print posters of Charlie Kirk, recasting a private expressive choice as a potential federal offense. The administration pressured federal prosecutors in Virginia to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James with mortgage fraud despite a lack of evidence, and when the US attorney did not deliver, the president prepared to fire him. These actions did not yet amount to a formal rewriting of criminal law, but they showed how existing statutes could be bent toward punishing disfavored speech and opponents. That is how law becomes a weapon.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the central vector for this weaponization. ICE conducted military-style raids across Los Angeles, with masked agents in unmarked vehicles detaining people based on appearance and accent. A Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for warrantless immigration raids, overturning a restraining order that had slowed such operations in California. In Georgia, an ICE raid at a Hyundai plant swept up more than 300 Korean workers, many with valid visas, in what officials later called an operational mistake. Reports described overcrowded detention, lack of basic supplies, and derogatory treatment. A separate court filing detailed inhumane conditions for children at the Dilley family detention center in Texas\'97prolonged confinement, dirty water, sleep deprivation, and emotional abuse\'97allegedly in violation of the Flores settlement. At Angola prison in Louisiana, the notorious \'93Camp J\'94 unit was reopened as an ICE detention site, now called Camp 57, bringing civil detainees into a space long associated with brutality. Together, these actions blurred the line between civil and criminal detention and made immigration status a gateway to harsher treatment and fewer rights. Fear was the through line.\
\
The week also saw a structural shift in how citizenship itself was stratified by wealth, origin, and ideology. Texas enacted a law barring many nationals of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea from buying most real estate, reviving the logic of alien land laws under a new banner. The president signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual fee on H\uc0\u8209 1B visas, a sum that would effectively reserve skilled immigration for the largest and richest employers. On the same day, he created the \'93Gold Card\'94 visa, offering expedited immigrant status to individuals or corporations willing to make million-dollar \'93gifts\'94 to the United States. At the other end of the spectrum, the administration moved to revoke visas from immigrants who had celebrated Charlie Kirk\'92s death, and an immigration judge ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and activist, for misstatements on his green card form, even as a federal court barred his immediate removal. An appeals court ordered the deportation of Mario Guevara, an Atlanta journalist detained after covering protests, despite his path to residency. These decisions, layered atop warrantless raids and solitary confinement in detention, made clear that access to safety and due process depended increasingly on wealth, nationality, and political speech. Citizenship became tiered.\
\
A fourth development was the systematic capture and redirection of administrative agencies away from public protection and toward private and ideological interests. At the Environmental Protection Agency, leaders proposed rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gases harm human health, thereby undermining the legal basis for federal climate regulation. They also moved to dismantle the agency\'92s research office, cutting staff and capacity. The Justice Department filed briefs seeking to kill Vermont\'92s Climate Superfund Act, which would make major polluters pay for climate damage, arguing that the state law was unconstitutional. At the Department of Labor, officials unveiled nearly 150 deregulatory actions, including a proposal to strip minimum wage and overtime protections from 3.7 million domestic care workers. The same department canceled office leases and cut international labor grants, including $500 million dedicated to fighting child and forced labor abroad. These were not isolated policy tweaks. They were structural changes that shifted the state\'92s posture from guarding workers and the environment to shielding employers and polluters.\
\
Public health and science were hit just as hard. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as health secretary, purged the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, removing its existing members and installing appointees with little vaccine experience or open skepticism about vaccine safety. He then fired CDC Director Susan Monarez after she resisted demands to pre-approve all vaccine panel recommendations without evidence. The administration canceled a $590 million Moderna contract for a bird flu vaccine and cut funding for mRNA research more broadly. The Pentagon stopped sharing atmospheric and oceanic data with scientists, citing cybersecurity, and the president issued an order on \'93restoring gold standard science\'94 that in practice brought research grants under closer presidential control and targeted diversity initiatives. At the ACIP meeting itself, the new committee first voted to maintain Vaccines for Children coverage of the combined MMRV shot, then reversed itself the next day and eliminated that coverage, with some members revealing they did not understand the program\'92s purpose. The committee narrowly voted against requiring prescriptions for Covid vaccines but emphasized \'93individual-based decision making\'94 and clinician consultation. These moves did not yet ban vaccines, but they weakened the infrastructure that had made them widely and reliably available, especially to poor children. The scaffolding was being stripped away.\
\
Labor protections and social safety nets were eroded in parallel. The Labor Department\'92s deregulatory agenda, especially the removal of wage and overtime protections for domestic care workers, shifted bargaining power further toward employers and left millions more dependent on individual negotiation. The president signed a domestic spending bill that cut Medicaid and the Children\'92s Health Insurance Program by more than a trillion dollars over a decade, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting at least 10.5 million people losing coverage, many of them children. Republicans in Congress advanced provisions to delay a ban on PFAS-laden firefighting foam, cut $200 million from cleanup budgets, and lift a moratorium on incinerating the foam, despite known health risks. At the same time, Americans\'92 credit scores were falling at the fastest rate since the Great Recession, as living costs rose and student loan payments resumed. The combined effect was to increase economic precarity while weakening the public tools meant to cushion it. Hardship was treated as acceptable collateral.\
\
Information and memory became contested terrain in a more direct way than in earlier weeks. The Justice Department removed from its website a long-standing study showing that far-right extremists had committed more ideologically motivated homicides than any other domestic group. The administration ordered slavery-related exhibits and signs removed from national parks, including a historic photograph of a formerly enslaved man, stripping public spaces of reminders of past oppression. The Education Department announced a partnership with conservative groups to provide programming on patriotism and liberty, aligning civic education with a particular ideological frame. In the media sphere, the president filed a $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times and its partners, accusing them of acting as a partisan mouthpiece; a federal judge dismissed the complaint as invective-laden and legally deficient, but the suit itself signaled a willingness to use civil courts to intimidate. The goal was to shape what the public could see and know.\
\
The most visible clash over media freedom centered on Jimmy Kimmel\'92s late-night show. After Kimmel criticized those exploiting Charlie Kirk\'92s murder, FCC Chair Brendan Carr publicly suggested that ABC\'92s licensees could face regulatory \'93remedies\'94 if they continued to air him. Nexstar, the largest operator of ABC affiliates and a company seeking FCC approval for a merger with Tegna, announced it would stop carrying the show. ABC and its parent, Disney, then suspended Kimmel\'92s program indefinitely. Sinclair Broadcast Group, owned by a Trump ally, stepped in to fill the time slot on many stations with a one-hour tribute to Charlie Kirk and demanded that Kimmel apologize and donate to Kirk\'92s family. Carr later voiced support for Sinclair\'92s demands and launched investigations into NPR, PBS, and media companies engaged in diversity initiatives, while approving a merger that placed a Trump donor as ombudsman at CBS News. House Democrats responded with letters and an investigation into whether the FCC and the White House had abused regulatory power to shape programming, and some called for Carr\'92s resignation. But the structural message to broadcasters was clear. Critical content could bring regulatory pain, while aligned content would find favor.\
\
The administration\'92s rhetoric and legal posture toward dissent hardened further. Stephen Miller warned that law enforcement power would be used against political opponents labeled as domestic terrorists. The president announced that he was designating \'93antifa\'94 as a major terrorist organization, despite the absence of legal authority to apply such a label to domestic groups, and his aides explored an executive order invoking treason and sedition statutes against people who identified with antifa or worked in left-leaning nonprofits and voter turnout groups. Attorney General Bondi told employers they had an obligation to fire workers who disparaged Charlie Kirk. Vice President JD Vance used Kirk\'92s own podcast to spread baseless claims about left-wing violence. The president threatened ABC\'92s Jonathan Karl with possible Justice Department targeting for tough questioning and suggested that TV networks with negative coverage might face government punishment or license revocation, even though networks do not hold licenses. These statements did not yet translate into a formal new legal regime, but they shifted the climate. Dissenters were cast as disloyal, dangerous, or corrupt, and the boundaries of acceptable speech narrowed under the shadow of state power.\
\
Immigration and protest remained flashpoints where these trends converged. In New York, city comptroller Brad Lander, public advocate Jumaane Williams, and other elected officials were arrested by federal agents while attempting to conduct oversight of detainees at immigration courts. A separate protest outside an ICE intake facility at the Javits building led to the arrest of 71 people, including 11 lawmakers, for blocking access. In Chicago, federal agents in riot gear used teargas and pepper balls to disperse about 100 protesters, including congressional candidates, who were trying to block ICE vehicles. ICE announced that assaulting its officers would be treated as a federal felony and broadened its definition of threats to include actions like filming operations. At the same time, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered improvements to conditions at a federal building where immigrants were held, finding likely First and Fifth Amendment violations, and another judge blocked the deportation of Guatemalan children and upheld temporary protected status for Venezuelans. These rulings showed that parts of the judiciary still acted as a check, but they did so against a backdrop of increasingly militarized enforcement and shrinking space for protest. The clash was stark.\
\
Not all movement was in one direction. Courts dismissed the president\'92s defamation suit against the New York Times, blocked his attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve, ordered improvements in immigrant detention conditions, and halted deportations of vulnerable children and TPS holders. A jury acquitted a Los Angeles protester accused of assaulting a border patrol agent, in part because there was no video evidence to support the charge. A federal judge ordered Rudy Giuliani to pay more than $1.3 million in legal fees tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In Congress, House Democrats and some Republicans resisted the most extreme measures: a resolution to censure Representative Ilhan Omar failed, a provision that would have allowed the Secretary of State to revoke passports over alleged terrorism support was withdrawn, and lawmakers announced plans for legislation to protect anti-government speech from censorship. These actions mattered. They showed that institutional resistance had not vanished, even if it was often reactive and narrow.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 35, several processes were already in motion. The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for early November on the legality of the president\'92s global tariffs, a case that would test the outer bounds of emergency economic powers. The Court also faced the administration\'92s request to fire Lisa Cook, a decision with implications for central bank independence. The EPA\'92s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding and its draft risk evaluation for the chemical D4 entered public comment and advisory review, setting up future fights over climate and chemical regulation. The House and Senate remained locked in a funding standoff, with the Senate blocking a House bill that failed to protect healthcare programs, raising the risk of a government shutdown. House Democrats opened investigations into the FCC, ABC, and Sinclair over the Kimmel affair, and into contacts between the Trump administration, regulators, and media executives. Youth climate activists pressed their lawsuit against three executive orders declaring a \'93national energy emergency\'94 and boosting fossil fuels, arguing that the orders unlawfully endangered them. Each of these processes would, in later weeks, either reinforce or check the patterns visible now. The stakes were clear.\
\
By the end of Week 35, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'978:01 p.m.\'97captured a system under mounting strain. Executive power was more willing to ignore statutes and court orders. Law enforcement and immigration tools were more openly used to punish speech and protest. Agencies charged with protecting health, labor, and the climate were being repurposed to serve ideological and financial allies. Information about threats and history was being scrubbed or replaced, while media companies, under regulatory and market pressure, trimmed their sails. Courts and parts of Congress still pushed back, and civil society\'97from Minnesota voters electing a successor to a murdered legislator, to activists marching in Durham, to scholars and journalists speaking out\'97continued to assert democratic norms. But the balance of power tilted further toward a model in which dissent is suspect, vulnerability is exploited, and truth is curated from above. That is why the clock moved forward this week, and why these days will matter to anyone trying, in some future classroom or courtroom, to understand how a democracy can be hollowed out without a single dramatic break. The official end-of-period time is 8:01 p.m.\
