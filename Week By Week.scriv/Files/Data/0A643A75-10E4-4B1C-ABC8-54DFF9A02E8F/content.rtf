\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 19 Appendix: Citizenship as Leverage\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, a coordinated campaign against independent institutions, and intensifying stratification of rights by status and identity. Trump\'92s record pace of executive orders, floated suspension of habeas corpus, and defiance or end-runs around court orders push hard on unchecked presidency and normalized emergency powers. Immigration becomes the central arena: mass-arrest quotas, the planned Office of Remigration, Supreme Court green lights to end parole/TPS, and social-media vetting and visa halts for students collectively move the system toward a tiered citizenship regime. Simultaneously, the administration weaponizes state power against universities, public media, and specific firms, tying funding and access to loyalty while closing analytic and diplomatic capacity inside the State Department. The pardon spree for corrupt officials and wealthy allies, Boeing\'92s non-prosecution deal, and Trump-linked financial schemes deepen crony capitalism and impunity for elite crime. Yet courts, universities, state AGs, parents, and protest movements mount significant resistance, winning injunctions on tariffs, Harvard, WilmerHale, and media funding. Structurally, however, the week\'92s net pressure tilts toward entrenching authoritarian tools even as some guardrails still hold.\

President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on European Union goods and threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products (2025-05-24): Using sweeping unilateral tariffs and threats against a major ally and a single firm concentrated trade power in the presidency, bypassing normal legislative deliberation and raising stakes for economic coercion.\
\
4.

\
9. Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security ordered immigration agents to triple daily arrests to 3,000 per day (2025-05-28): Imposing a numerical arrest quota encouraged sweeping detentions, including in courthouses and other sensitive locations, heightening risks of due\uc0\u8209 process violations and community intimidation.\

\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1.
