      "summary": "Alex Jones, a rightwing conspiracy theorist, has filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him. This judgment was imposed after he falsely claimed that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. Jones is seeking to prevent his website, InfoWars, from being transferred to the satirical news site, The Onion, which acquired it at a bankruptcy auction. The Supreme Court is set to discuss his appeal in private. Jones's lawyers argue that the judgment threatens journalistic freedom and could deter journalists from publishing controversial content.",
