Week 23 of Trump’s second term moved the Democracy Clock from 8:00 to 8:01 p.m., a modest 1.2‑minute shift that belied a sharp consolidation of power. The president ordered large-scale airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites without congressional authorization, then managed intelligence and briefings to sell the operation as a “spectacular success” while sidelining contrary assessments and restricting classified access. At home, ICE and DHS intensified masked raids and wrongful detentions, backed by federalized Guard and Marines in Los Angeles and a rapidly expanding detention archipelago, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades to a new CoreCivic mega-facility. Courts both resisted and enabled this trajectory: whistleblowers described DOJ pressure to ignore injunctions even as the Supreme Court narrowed nationwide remedies and eased harsh deportations. Media, universities, and vaccine policy bodies were purged or coerced, while citizenship and safety grew more contingent on origin, ideology, and identity. Routine rulemaking continued, but under a moral floor described as collapsing.
