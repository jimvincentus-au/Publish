    "summary": "This week marked a significant continuation of the erosion of democratic norms, with multiple actions taken by the administration that blurred ethical boundaries and weakened institutional integrity. The use of law as a tool for political ends, alongside the militarization of domestic security and the manipulation of electoral processes, highlighted a troubling trend towards authoritarian consolidation. While there were pockets of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, the overall trajectory indicates a serious decline in the moral floor.",
