Week 32 records only a half‑minute advance on the Democracy Clock, yet the movement comes from a dense layering of control rather than a single rupture. In Washington, a manufactured "crime emergency" allowed the White House to seize operational command of D.C. policing, expand National Guard deployments, and treat the capital as a test bed for federal occupation, with threats aimed at Baltimore, Chicago, and other blue jurisdictions. Law enforcement and regulatory data were turned against critics and immigrants, even as elite‑linked cases like Epstein and Maxwell remained shrouded or leniently handled. Simultaneously, the administration drafted an order to end mail‑in voting, blessed gerrymandered maps, and attacked public and independent media, while taking a personal equity stake in Intel and rolling back wages, overtime, and union rights for millions of workers. Courts, civil servants, and organizers mounted scattered resistance, but the week’s through‑line is normalization: emergency powers, lawfare, and crony economics settling into the grain of governance.
