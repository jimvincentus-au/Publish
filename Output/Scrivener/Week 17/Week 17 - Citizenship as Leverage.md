Week 17: Citizenship as Leverage
A week of near-static clock time in which law, borders, and money were quietly retooled to sort belonging and shield power from consequence.
The seventeenth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single order or a single speech. It unfolded instead as a dense pattern of choices that pressed on the same set of nerves: who counts, who is protected, and who can say no. Immigration law, foreign money, and the machinery of information were all pulled into that pattern. The result was not open rupture but a tightening of the frame within which law and politics now operate. That frame grew narrower.
At the start of Week 17, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:59 p.m. It ended the week at the same public time, with a net movement of 0.1 minutes. The hands barely shifted, but the gears behind them did. The small numerical change reflects a week in which formal structures still held—courts issued injunctions, hearings were convened, agencies followed notice‑and‑comment rules—while the substance of those structures was bent toward executive advantage. Power was used more aggressively against migrants, critics, and independent institutions, and more openly in service of private and foreign interests, even as pockets of resistance slowed or blunted some of the blows.
The most direct pressure fell on habeas corpus and due process for migrants. Early in the week, a senior White House adviser floated suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and the Department of Homeland Security explored classifying migrant crossings as a “rebellion” or “invasion.” That framing was not rhetorical flourish. It was a search for legal hooks that would allow the administration to treat migration as an emergency akin to war and bypass the ordinary requirement that the government justify detention before a judge. In parallel, DHS shut down the CBP One app, closing a key lawful channel for asylum appointments and forcing more people into irregular crossings where they are easier to treat as security problems rather than rights‑bearing applicants. The message was clear.
On the ground, enforcement followed the same logic. The administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Afghans, declaring conditions improved despite Taliban rule, and moved to use the Alien Enemies Act—an eighteenth‑century wartime statute—to deport Venezuelans accused of gang ties. A federal judge in Pennsylvania allowed that use of the law, provided there was notice and a chance to challenge, while another judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrant tax data with ICE. At the same time, the FBI was ordered to shift a third of its resources from white‑collar crime to immigration enforcement. The combined effect was to widen the tools available for rapid removal and to concentrate investigative power downward, away from elite misconduct and toward vulnerable noncitizens.
Yet the courts did not simply acquiesce. The Supreme Court issued an injunction halting deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act for lack of due process, and in a separate 7–2 decision it held that alleged gang members could not be deported without meaningful procedures. Federal judges ordered the release of detained students and scholars whose activism on Gaza had been cast as a security threat, and one judge in South Dakota blocked the deportation of an Indian PhD graduate over a minor traffic violation. These rulings did not reverse the administration’s strategy, but they forced it to move within narrower channels and reaffirmed that even in the immigration context, constitutional protections still apply. The brakes still worked, but only under strain.
The president’s own words cut in the opposite direction. By the end of the week he was publicly questioning whether people in the United States have a right to due process at all. That statement, combined with Stephen Miller’s habeas trial balloon and DHS’s “invasion” memos, signaled an executive willing to test the outer edge of constitutional limits. Deportations already proceeding in defiance of some court orders, and a request for 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with immigration enforcement, showed how quickly those ideas could be translated into practice. The legal system remained present, but it was now reacting to an administration that treated rights as obstacles to be worked around rather than boundaries to be respected.
The same enforcement tools were turned inward against dissenters and critics. ICE agents arrested Newark’s mayor, Ras Baraka, at a protest outside a private immigration detention facility, sending a clear message that even elected local officials risked custody if they challenged federal partners. Homeland Security spokespeople went further, threatening that Democratic members of Congress could themselves be arrested if they attempted oversight visits at the same site. In Tennessee, traffic‑stop sweeps funneled more than a hundred people into immigration custody, drawing accusations of racial profiling. Inside the Capitol, disability‑rights activists protesting Medicaid cuts were arrested in a committee room, and Ben Cohen was taken into custody during a Senate hearing after denouncing the Gaza blockade and domestic spending cuts. Protest was treated as a policing problem.
Universities became another front. At Columbia, student protesters were arrested and student journalists briefly suspended as campus authorities and New York police tried to contain Gaza‑related demonstrations. Behind the scenes, ICE and federal prosecutors obtained a warrant under allegedly misleading pretenses to target Columbia students for “harboring” violations, using that pretext to reach their residences and devices. The State Department instructed university officers to report international students involved in certain protests deemed antisemitic or terrorist‑related, effectively turning campus administrators into extensions of immigration surveillance. For foreign students, the line between political speech and deportation risk grew thin.
High‑profile critics and legal actors were not spared. Customs and Border Protection subjected commentator Hasan Piker to prolonged questioning at the border focused on his views of Trump and Gaza, blurring the line between security screening and ideological vetting. The Secret Service and DHS opened a threat investigation into former FBI director James Comey over an ambiguous Instagram post, signaling that even elite critics could find themselves under formal scrutiny for speech. In Wisconsin, a state judge was indicted for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE in her courtroom, and she moved to dismiss the case on judicial‑immunity grounds. At the federal level, Justice Department leaders prepared investigations of prosecutors who had brought cases against Trump, while a new “weaponization” working group announced plans to publicly “name and shame” political opponents who could not be charged. Law was being pointed outward.
Courts and civil society pushed back where they could. Judges ordered the release of detained students and scholars, and a federal court temporarily blocked the administration from canceling grants to the American Bar Association for training lawyers in domestic and sexual violence cases, seeing the move as potential retaliation. Another court preserved ABA funding even as the administration sought new powers to strip nonprofits’ tax‑exempt status if they were deemed “terrorist‑supporting,” a label that could easily be stretched to cover disfavored advocacy groups. Bruce Springsteen used a concert to denounce attacks on due process and ideological pressure on universities, illustrating how cultural figures tried to keep democratic norms visible in public life. But the pattern of enforcement—border screening, warrants, threat investigations—was now clearly tilted toward chilling protest and dissent, especially for those with precarious status.
Beneath these enforcement choices lay a deeper reordering of citizenship and belonging. The administration offered refugee status to a group of white South Africans, framed as victims of “genocide,” even as it maintained a broader suspension of refugee resettlement. At the same time, it terminated Temporary Protected Status for Afghans, asserting that conditions had improved enough to send them back despite ongoing repression under the Taliban. New executive orders authorized deportation or exclusion of non‑citizens based on their political and cultural views, including broad definitions of antisemitism that could sweep in pro‑Palestinian speech. Together, these moves signaled that humanitarian relief and entry rights would be granted or withdrawn not only on the basis of danger abroad but on alignment with the administration’s ideological and cultural preferences.
The constitutional core of membership was also put into play. The Supreme Court heard consolidated challenges to Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship for U.S.‑born children of noncitizens, placing Fourteenth Amendment guarantees under direct review. Arguments suggested skepticism from some justices, but the very fact that the Court was entertaining the order showed how far the debate had shifted. In South Carolina, the state’s high court upheld a six‑week abortion ban, narrowing reproductive autonomy and reinforcing a vision of rights that varied sharply by jurisdiction. Inside the military, Pentagon leaders ordered academies to disregard race, ethnicity, and sex in admissions while preserving athletic preferences, and directed the removal of hundreds of books on diversity and gender from military and base school libraries worldwide. These steps reshaped who would lead the armed forces and what ideas would be available to service members and their families.
Economic policy reinforced the stratification. House Republicans advanced a tax bill redesigning the child tax credit in ways that excluded many low‑income and undocumented families from full benefits, deepening the link between economic support and citizenship status. Executive orders on immigration allowed deportation or exclusion of non‑citizens for their viewpoints, while a flawed analysis was used to justify an FDA review of mifepristone regulations, threatening access to abortion medication through politicized science. The same state that secured the release of the last living American hostage in Gaza, demonstrating its capacity to protect citizens abroad, was simultaneously narrowing the circle of those at home who could claim full membership and bodily autonomy. Protection became conditional.
Foreign money and personal enrichment threaded through the week’s decisions. At the center was Qatar. The president planned to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One and later his presidential library, an arrangement that blurred the line between state asset and private gift. At the same time, the Trump Organization signed a $5.5 billion deal to build a Trump International Golf Club in Qatar with Qatari Diar, a state‑owned firm, and Dar Global. These projects unfolded alongside a large defense and aviation package with Qatar, tying arms sales and economic cooperation to the same counterpart that was offering the jet and hosting the golf course.
The legal justifications for these arrangements were kept deliberately opaque. The Justice Department and White House counsel produced emoluments opinions blessing the jet and related deals, but the reasoning was not made public. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer responded by placing a hold on Justice Department nominations until the administration explained the Qatar jet deal, using confirmation powers as leverage to enforce constitutional safeguards. Yet the deals moved forward, and the administration’s willingness to accept such largesse signaled to foreign governments that access and favor could be purchased through co‑branded projects and luxury gifts.
Qatar was not alone. SpaceX secured a $6 billion Pentagon contract as part of a proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield, a project whose inspector general had been fired earlier in the term. Business leaders who had once boycotted Saudi Arabia attended a high‑profile investment lunch there alongside Trump, underscoring how economic opportunities and arms deals could override human‑rights concerns. In Serbia, a $500 million Trump‑branded hotel project in Belgrade was halted after a forged demolition document surfaced, raising questions about corruption and governance in cross‑border deals tied to presidential associates. Across these cases, foreign policy and national security decisions were entangled with the president’s private business interests in ways that made it difficult to distinguish public strategy from personal gain.
Inside the justice and security apparatus, the same pattern of self‑protection and loyalty over law played out. The Justice Department announced plans to investigate prosecutors who had brought cases against Trump, turning the investigative lens back on those who had tried to hold him accountable. Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Mar‑a‑Lago classified documents case on novel grounds, ruling that the special counsel had been unlawfully appointed, and thereby removing a major legal threat to the president. The indictment of the Wisconsin judge over her handling of an immigrant arrest in her courtroom served as a warning shot to the judiciary: decisions that frustrated federal enforcement could now carry personal criminal risk.
At the same time, the capacity of the state to enforce civil‑rights protections was being hollowed out. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division saw a mass exodus, with reports that 70 percent of attorneys had left; leadership asked departing staff to reconsider, but the scale of loss underscored deep politicization. The administration nominated Casey Means, an unlicensed, anti‑vaccine figure, as surgeon general, prioritizing ideological alignment over medical expertise. It fired the head of the U.S. Copyright Office soon after she issued a cautious report on AI and copyright, signaling intolerance for independent expert judgment in a key knowledge‑governance role. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard removed the chair and deputy of the National Intelligence Council after a report contradicted Trump’s claims, politicizing intelligence assessment and narrowing the space for inconvenient facts.
Congressional oversight struggled to keep pace. The House Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority summoned former special counsel prosecutor Jay Bratt to testify about Trump prosecutions, signaling willingness to pressure prosecutorial decisions. FBI Director Kash Patel appeared at a Senate Appropriations hearing without a required budget plan, hampering lawmakers’ ability to scrutinize spending. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem refused to answer basic questions about deportations of U.S. citizens and immigration practices. FAA officials declined to disclose how many air traffic controllers had left since Trump took office, even as Newark airport suffered severe staffing shortages that caused major delays and raised safety concerns. Judges Amy St. Eve and Robert Conrad requested increased funding for judicial security amid rising threats, and conservative jurist J. Michael Luttig publicly warned that Trump was weaponizing the federal government, but their appeals underscored how exposed the remaining pockets of independence felt.
Information and memory became contested terrain in their own right. The White House launched “White House Wire,” a government‑run news website, and filled it with AI‑generated imagery and videos of deportation flights designed to dramatize its immigration agenda. These tools allowed the administration to bypass independent media filters and present emotionally charged narratives directly to the public. At the same time, it excluded wire service reporters from Air Force One during a presidential trip, using access as a lever to punish or sideline outlets that might offer critical coverage. Control of the story became a governing tool.
The most dramatic move came at Voice of America. In defiance of a court order, the administration fired nearly 600 contractors, most of them journalists, gutting a major U.S.‑funded international broadcaster. Many of those dismissed were immigrants or refugees from authoritarian states whose immigration status depended on their employment. The firings weakened independent reporting to foreign audiences and raised fresh rule‑of‑law concerns about compliance with judicial directives. Combined with the creation of a state‑run news site, the VOA purge marked a shift toward a media environment in which state‑aligned outlets thrive while independent voices are starved.
Universities and libraries were drawn into the same struggle over what could be seen and studied. The Pentagon and the Department of Defense Education Activity ordered the removal of DEI and gender‑related books from military and base school libraries worldwide, narrowing the range of perspectives available to service members’ families and reshaping civic education in a more nationalist, less equality‑focused direction. The administration cut an additional $450 million in federal grants to Harvard University amid a First Amendment lawsuit, using funding levers to pressure a leading academic institution that had challenged its policies. The State Department’s directive that universities report international students involved in certain protests turned campus administrators into reluctant participants in surveillance, with obvious chilling effects on research and debate.
The administration’s approach to information was not limited to censorship and pressure. It also embraced spectacle. DHS explored the idea of a reality television show in which immigrants would compete for U.S. citizenship, a concept that collapsed the gravity of legal status into entertainment. Economic messaging followed a similar pattern of manipulation and volatility. The president announced a 100 percent tariff on all foreign‑produced movies, mixing cultural protectionism with trade policy. Over fifty changes to tariff policy, including sharp hikes on Chinese goods followed by a 90‑day pause that reduced rates from 145 percent to around 30 percent, created an unstable trade environment. Executive orders on drug pricing promised to link U.S. prices to the lowest paid abroad while threatening foreign negotiators. Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating for the first time since 1917, citing widening deficits and stalled fiscal reforms, even as official rhetoric painted the economic picture in optimistic terms.
Behind these moves lay a fiscal and regulatory agenda that favored defense and elite interests over social welfare and public health. The administration proposed a $1.01 trillion military budget with deep cuts to non‑defense spending, entrenching a model that privileged contractors and the Pentagon over education, environment, and health. House Republicans advanced coordinated plans to extend the 2017 tax cuts, impose new work requirements, and cut Medicaid and SNAP by hundreds of billions of dollars, while phasing out key green tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act after 2031. Environmental and health protections were rolled back: the Department of Energy eliminated 47 appliance efficiency regulations, and the administration moved to rescind limits on four toxic PFAS chemicals in drinking water. Newark’s air traffic controller crisis, driven by staffing cuts and reorganization, offered a concrete glimpse of how austerity and deregulation could degrade critical infrastructure and safety.
Not every institution moved in the same direction. Courts approved a $750 million settlement with victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden and imposed new safety policies on Columbia University and NewYork‑Presbyterian Hospital, holding powerful institutions accountable for decades of sexual abuse. The FBI launched a nationwide investigation into an online group coercing minors into sexual content and self‑harm, showing federal capacity to address digital exploitation. Agencies continued routine but important work: the EPA published environmental impact statements and proposed Superfund cleanup settlements; the FDA updated drug and biologic patent review periods, approved new food color additives, and sought input on infant formula standards; the Election Assistance Commission refined voting‑system reporting forms and financial worksheets for election grants. Harvard Law School confirmed that a long‑held document was an original 1300 Magna Carta, a reminder of the deep historical roots of due process and rule‑of‑law principles.
These pockets of normal governance and occasional resistance did not cancel out the week’s broader pattern. They showed that institutional muscle memory for rule‑bound practice still exists, and that some judges, civil servants, and civil‑society actors are willing to assert it. But they also revealed how much strain those muscles are under. Judges asked for more security as threats rose. Independent experts were fired or sidelined. Agencies that continued to follow notice‑and‑comment procedures did so in an environment where major decisions about war, migration, and money were increasingly made through opaque opinions and personal relationships.
Week 17 thus marked not a dramatic plunge but a deepening of the same grooves that had already been cut. Law was used more openly as a weapon against migrants, protesters, prosecutors, and judges. Foreign money and personal business interests were woven more tightly into the fabric of state policy. Citizenship and protection were sorted more explicitly by race, origin, and ideology. Media, universities, and libraries were pressed to align or pay a price. Courts and some state actors pushed back in specific cases, preserving islands of due process and accountability, but the tide of executive overreach and institutional capture continued to rise around them. The clock’s face stayed still; the machinery behind it did not.
