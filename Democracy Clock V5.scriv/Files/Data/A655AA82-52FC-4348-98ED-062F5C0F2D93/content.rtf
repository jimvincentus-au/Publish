\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 9 captures a presidency that has learned to treat constraint as an insult. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to justify mass deportations, then defied Judge James Boasberg\'92s orders to turn planes around and answered with impeachment calls and public smears. Courts also blocked elements of Elon Musk\'96linked DOGE data grabs, the dismantling of USAID, and parts of a transgender military ban, but compliance became slow, partial, or openly contested. Simultaneously, executive orders moved to hollow out the Department of Education, Social Security operations, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, while universities faced funding freezes and visa threats tied to protest and Palestine. Immigration raids, TPS revocations, and militarized border plans deepened a hierarchy of belonging. Information channels narrowed as Voice of America was gutted and critical advisories vanished online. The Democracy Clock advanced only 0.3 minutes, yet the week showed how rapidly law, bureaucracy, and memory can be repurposed when obedience to limits is no longer assumed.\
