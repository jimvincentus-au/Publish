<h1>Week 20 Appendix: Surveillance as Everyday Governance</h1>
<p><em>In a week of near-still clock time, immigration raids, data centralization, and partisan clemency showed power consolidating quietly inside a more permissive order.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian structural pressure, with the executive branch aggressively consolidating power while degrading multiple guardrails simultaneously. Trump’s team signaled willingness to bypass Congress on spending and civil service purges, weaponized immigration and law enforcement against political opponents and protesters, and normalized sweeping travel bans and mass deportations. The House advanced the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” embedding deep social cuts, deregulatory favors, and even non-reviewable mining leases, illustrating how legislative process is being used to entrench crony capitalism and environmental rollback. Courts were a mixed arena: some rulings protected migrants and speech, but the Supreme Court repeatedly used emergency orders to greenlight data grabs and union-hostile moves, and to shield industries like guns from accountability. Information control and memory politics intensified through attacks on NPR/PBS, censorship of VA scientists, historical erasures, and conspiratorial presidential messaging. Across immigration, reproductive rights, veterans’ care, science agencies, and FEMA/NOAA, policy choices systematically shifted risk and suffering onto vulnerable groups while preserving elite advantage, indicating a regime that treats inequality and institutional chaos as governing tools rather than side effects.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump announced and signed orders doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%: By sharply raising metal tariffs via executive action, the president unilaterally reshaped trade conditions with limited congressional input, concentrating economic decision-making power in the executive and testing checks on tariff authority. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered an investigation into former President Biden’s competence and presidency: Ordering an executive-branch probe into a predecessor’s mental fitness and decision-making weaponized investigative powers against a political rival, blurring lines between neutral oversight and partisan re-litigation of prior governance. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump launched investigations into Joe Biden’s pardons and clemencies: Targeting a former president’s clemency decisions for special scrutiny risked turning prosecutorial discretion into a tool against political opponents, undermining the norm of even-handed treatment of presidential powers. (2025-06-02)</li>
<li>President Trump issued mass pardons and commutations for January 6 defendants and ordered related cases dropped: Granting sweeping clemency to January 6 offenders and halting prosecutions signaled tolerance of political violence on the regime’s behalf, weakening deterrence and the rule of law around attacks on democratic institutions. (2025-06-03)</li>
<li>Trump administration fired or sidelined prosecutors handling January 6 cases and disbanded the Capitol siege section: Removing prosecutors who pursued January 6 cases and dismantling their unit undermined prosecutorial independence and signaled that accountability for insurrection-related crimes depends on political loyalty. (2025-06-03)</li>
<li>President Trump signed proclamations imposing a broad travel ban on nationals from 12 countries and restricting entry from seven more: Reviving and expanding nationality-based travel bans concentrated sweeping gatekeeping power in the executive, stratifying access to U.S. territory and family unity by origin under a security rationale with limited individualized review. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump signed a proclamation suspending Harvard University from the student visa program and restricting foreign student visas: Targeting a single university’s ability to host foreign students used immigration powers to punish a disfavored institution, pressuring academic independence and signaling that access to U.S. study can hinge on political alignment. (2025-06-04)</li>
<li>President Trump threatened to impose large fines on California over trans athlete participation in sports: Threatening punitive federal fines against a state for allowing trans athletes in school sports leveraged national power to coerce state policy on civil rights, undermining state autonomy and equal protection norms. (2025-06-03)</li>
<li>President Trump publicly threatened to terminate Elon Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts after political disagreements: Using the prospect of canceling major federal contracts as retaliation for criticism blurred the line between neutral procurement and personal vendetta, signaling that access to state resources depends on political loyalty. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered a large military parade to celebrate his birthday: Directing a personal military parade used state coercive symbols for leader glorification, normalizing personalized displays of force that can erode norms of civilian, institution-centered democratic culture. (2025-06-02)</li>
<li>President Trump issued an executive order reshaping federal cybersecurity policy and expanding AI-enabled defenses: Centralizing cybersecurity strategy and expanding AI-based defenses strengthened protection against foreign threats but also broadened executive control over digital infrastructure and data, with implications for surveillance and accountability. (2025-06-06)</li>
<li>President Trump issued executive orders to expand supersonic flight, tighten drone airspace control, and promote U.S. drone dominance: A trio of aviation and drone orders used unilateral authority to reset safety rules, expand commercial and security uses, and centralize control of airspace, increasing executive leverage over critical transport and surveillance technologies. (2025-06-06)</li>
<li>President Trump ended enforcement of federal emergency abortion guidance under EMTALA: Halting enforcement of emergency abortion protections narrowed federal guarantees for life-saving care, shifting life-and-death decisions toward state bans and signaling executive willingness to roll back established health rights. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate Biden-era emergency abortion guidance: Framing prior emergency abortion protections as suspect policy and ending them recast federal health guarantees as partisan, weakening the expectation that core medical rights are insulated from political swings. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships to emphasize a &quot;warrior culture&quot;: Stripping a Navy ship of Harvey Milk’s name and similar moves used command authority to recast official symbols away from civil rights figures, narrowing whose histories are honored in state narratives. (2025-06-03)</li>
<li>President Trump announced plans to cancel significant federal funding and grants for California: Preparing to strip California of federal funds weaponized fiscal powers against a political adversary state, threatening residents’ services to pressure state leaders and eroding norms of neutral intergovernmental support. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>President Trump publicly promoted a conspiracy theory claiming Joe Biden was executed and replaced by clones: Amplifying an extreme conspiracy about a former president’s death from the bully pulpit degraded shared reality and modeled disinformation as acceptable political communication, undermining informed consent in democratic governance. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era guidance requiring hospitals to perform emergency abortions where state bans apply: Revoking federal protection for emergency abortions in hostile states reduced national baseline rights to life-saving care, leaving access to depend more heavily on local politics and weakening uniform application of federal law. (2025-06-02)</li>
<li>Trump administration announced plans to transform the State Department’s refugee bureau into an Office of Remigration: Reorienting a refugee-focused bureau toward facilitating migrant return signaled a structural shift away from protection toward removal, embedding a more exclusionary vision of membership into foreign and humanitarian policy. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>Trump administration deployed National Guard and US Marines to Los Angeles to suppress mostly peaceful anti-deportation protests: Using military forces to police civilian demonstrations against deportations militarized domestic protest management, chilling dissent and blurring boundaries between civil law enforcement and armed forces. (2025-06-03)</li>
<li>Trump administration announced a broad travel ban that also trapped many veterans’ translators abroad: Imposing a nationality-based travel ban that stranded translators who aided U.S. forces signaled that loyalty to the U.S. does not guarantee protection, undermining trust essential for future military partnerships.

<li>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought signaled plans to use impoundment and executive tools to cut federal jobs and spending without full congressional approval: Proposing to bypass Congress on major workforce and budget cuts challenged the legislature’s power of the purse and suggested a readiness to revive constrained impoundment tactics to centralize fiscal control in the executive. (2025-06-01)</li>
<li>U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump’s &quot;Liberation Day&quot; tariffs were unconstitutional without congressional authorization: By striking down unilateral tariffs as beyond presidential authority, the trade court reinforced Congress’s constitutional role over taxation and trade, modestly checking executive overreach in economic policy. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>Federal appeals court temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that had blocked many of Trump’s tariffs: Allowing contested tariffs to remain in force during appeal preserved executive leverage over trade while legal challenges proceed, illustrating how interim judicial decisions can sustain disputed policies. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 migrants during ongoing litigation: Letting parole terminations proceed before final review exposed hundreds of thousands to deportation, showing how emergency high-court decisions can reshape lives and immigration policy before full merits consideration. (2025-05-31)</li>
<li>U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on nationwide injunctions affecting Trump’s efforts to restrict birthright citizenship: Taking up a challenge to courts’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions in birthright citizenship disputes opened the door to narrowing judicial tools that currently check sweeping executive actions. (2025-06-01)</li>

<li>U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay in a Social Security Administration labor dispute, favoring management over unions: Allowing the SSA to proceed with contested employment practices during litigation tilted the balance toward agency leadership and away from union protections, weakening organized labor’s leverage inside government.

<li>U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Mexico’s lawsuit against U.S. gunmakers under federal immunity law: By shielding gun manufacturers from Mexico’s suit over cartel violence, the Court reaffirmed broad statutory immunity for a powerful industry, limiting cross-border accountability for weapons flows. (2025-06-05)</li>
<li>U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Catholic Charities is exempt from unemployment taxes under the First Amendment: Expanding religious exemptions from unemployment taxes adjusted the boundary between church and state, potentially encouraging more entities to seek faith-based carve-outs from generally applicable labor laws.

<li>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan allowed 14 states’ lawsuit against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to proceed: Letting states challenge the legality of a Musk-led government unit preserved a key avenue for contesting novel delegations of state power to private actors.

<h3>Economic Structure</h3>
