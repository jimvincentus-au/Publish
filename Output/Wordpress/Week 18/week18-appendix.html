<h1>Week 18 Appendix: Inequality as Operating System</h1>
<p><em>A reconciliation megabill, weaponized borders, and captured institutions hardwire hierarchy into law while the Democracy Clock’s hands barely seem to move.</em></p>
<p>This week delivers a concentrated surge of structural pressure toward authoritarian governance, anchored in three domains: a sweeping redistribution of fiscal power upward, aggressive weaponization of immigration and law enforcement, and a coordinated assault on independent institutions. Passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and related budget maneuvers hardwire inequality into tax and spending structures, slash Medicaid and SNAP, and massively expand deportation and detention capacity, entrenching traits 32, 36, and 37. Simultaneously, the administration normalizes impunity for January 6 offenders while pursuing protesters, immigrants, and oversight-minded officials, deepening traits 4, 6, 9, and 41. Executive and judicial moves—TPS termination, dismantling of consent decrees, politicized appointments, and Supreme Court stays empowering presidential control over independent agencies—erode checks and civil service neutrality (traits 1, 14, 22, 38). Information control and narrative warfare—from mandated election lies in Oklahoma schools to press intimidation and foreign-influence scandals—further degrade truth infrastructure (traits 52, 53, 55, 60). Courts and some state actors do push back on specific excesses, but the net effect is a major weekly ratchet toward a unitary, patronage-driven state with stratified citizenship and hollowed social protections.</p>
