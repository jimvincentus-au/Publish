Week 15 marks a consolidation of trends that had been gathering since the start of Trump’s second term. The Democracy Clock jumps 10.3 minutes, from 10:24 to 10:34 p.m., not because of a single rupture but through interlocking structural shifts. An executive order moves tens of thousands of civil service jobs into political patronage, while the Department of Government Efficiency purges key agencies and hollows out enforcement capacity. Law is openly weaponized: pardons erase over a billion dollars in elite restitution, anti‑corruption cases are dropped, and emergency powers and the Alien Enemies Act are stretched to target migrants, lawyers, and opponents. Crony capitalism becomes indistinguishable from governance as access to the presidency is sold through clubs and cryptocurrency schemes. Independent media and public broadcasting are defunded and sidelined in favor of a state‑aligned ecosystem and a White House propaganda site. Universities, curricula, and museums are pressured to rewrite history and suppress dissent. Citizenship is stratified by origin, language, and faith. Courts, states, and civil society still resist in places, but the architecture of control grows more coherent.
