# Week 35 Appendix: Ordinary Emergency as Method

This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian pressure across nearly every safeguard of U.S. democracy. The Trump administration used executive power aggressively against courts, the Fed, cities, immigrants, media, and science agencies, while Congress and the courts only partially resisted. Immigration and law-enforcement policy were weaponized: warrantless raids, solitary confinement, reopening Angola’s ‘Camp J’ for ICE, mass arrests of lawful workers, and criminalization of healthcare workers and protesters. Simultaneously, RFK Jr.’s purge of vaccine institutions and EPA’s move to rescind the endangerment finding signaled a coordinated assault on science-based governance. Media freedom took a sharp hit: FCC threats, Kimmel’s suspension, Sinclair/Nexstar programming shifts, DOJ defamation suits, and removal of a far‑right violence study all entrenched a pro‑regime information environment. New immigration and H‑1B policies stratified legal status by wealth and ideology, while the “Gold Card” visa and UAE chip/crypto deals deepened crony capitalism. There were pockets of resistance—federal courts blocking some deportations and the Fed firing, congressional investigations, state-level vaccine guidance—but these were outweighed by systemic moves toward rule-by-decree, criminalization of dissent, and curated memory.
