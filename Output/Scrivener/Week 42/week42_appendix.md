# Week 42 Appendix: Hunger and Pardons as Power

This week combines an extraordinary concentration of authoritarian moves from the federal executive with a surprisingly strong, though still outgunned, democratic counter-mobilization. On the decay side, the Trump administration openly defies court orders on SNAP, stretches war powers to cover lethal boat bombings, threatens or plans military deployments in Venezuela, Mexico, and domestically under the Insurrection Act, and issues sweeping pardons for 2020 election subversion figures and controversial allies. DOJ is visibly weaponized against enemies and protective of friends, while ICE and other enforcement arms escalate raids, family separations, and even contemplate private bounty hunters and a child-tracking call center. Regulatory and fiscal policy is heavily captured by donors and industry, from Extremity Care’s ballroom-linked windfall to FCC prison-call hikes and a massive ICE detention buildout. Simultaneously, voters and courts deliver notable pushback: Democrats win key governorships and commissions, Maine voters reject voter ID, Pennsylvania retains a pro-voting-rights supreme court, judges rebuke politicized prosecutions and SNAP defiance, and civil society plans mass protest. Structurally, however, the week’s net pressure tilts sharply toward entrenched executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and normalized crisis governance.

Week 42 Events

Power and Authority

1. Department of Justice told Congress the War Powers Resolution did not apply to lethal boat bombings (2025-11-01): DOJ’s claim that airstrikes on boats are not “hostilities” narrowed War Powers constraints, expanding the president’s ability to conduct lethal operations without timely congressional authorization or oversight.

6.

8. President Trump publicly vowed to defy a federal court order on SNAP benefits while his administration partially complied (2025-11-03): Trump’s declaration that he would ignore a court order on food aid, even as staff sent partial payments, eroded respect for judicial authority and used essential benefits as political leverage.

9. President Trump refused to release full SNAP funds despite a court mandate, citing the need to keep the country “liquid” (2025-11-06): By withholding court-ordered SNAP funds from over 41 million people, Trump used executive control over basic subsistence to pressure political opponents and test the enforceability of judicial rulings.

11.

12. President Trump issued pardons to seven individuals including Michael McMahon, with initially identical signatures on clemency orders (2025-11-07): Issuing controversial pardons with apparently cloned signatures, later replaced, raised doubts about the authenticity and care of clemency decisions, weakening confidence in a key constitutional power.

13. President Trump signed pardons for 77 individuals involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election (2025-11-07): Mass pardons for actors in the 2020 election subversion schemes removed federal accountability for attempts to overturn certified results, signaling impunity for future anti-democratic plots.
