\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 21 centers on a single experiment: the federalization and deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and active-duty Marines into Los Angeles over California\'92s explicit objections. Framed as a response to \'93insurrection\'94 and \'93invasion,\'94 the move tests how far a president can weaponize federal power against a disfavored state, using immigration enforcement as the core instrument. ICE raids without warrants, abusive detention conditions, and arrests of immigrants at churches, courts, and check-ins reveal law functioning as regime weapon rather than limit. Elected officials and community observers who attempt oversight are arrested, denied entry, or physically removed. Parallel campaigns target journalists, universities, public broadcasters, and DEI-related education, tightening control over information and culture. Environmental and health agencies are hollowed out and repopulated with ideologues. Courts and blue-state officials win important but fragile rulings on deportations, voting rules, and troop deployments. The Democracy Clock nudges from 7:51 to 7:52 p.m., a small numerical shift that masks a significant consolidation of method.\
