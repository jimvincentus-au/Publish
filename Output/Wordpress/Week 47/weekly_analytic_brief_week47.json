    "Executive branch: Expanded its claim to regulate AI nationally, shape independent agencies, and conduct military and immigration operations with minimal oversight, deepening patterns of unilateralism.",
    "Congress: Showed mixed behavior\u2014assertive on NATO, Ukraine, and Pentagon transparency, but gridlocked on healthcare and often reactive rather than proactive in constraining executive overreach.",
    "Courts: Acted as a partial brake\u2014blocking some Guard deployments, unlawful appointments, and immigration detentions\u2014while the Supreme Court signaled openness to enlarging presidential control over independent agencies and tolerating partisan maps.",
    "Civil society and states: Illinois, immigrant-rights groups, churches, and boycotts demonstrated creative resistance to federal immigration and corporate behavior, but remained structurally outgunned by federal enforcement capacity.",
    "Media and tech: Major outlets moved toward prediction-market integration and potential rightward realignment under Trump-aligned ownership, while AI and tech firms intensified lobbying for deregulated, federally preempted environments."

  "oddities_or_open_questions": [
    "The Indiana Senate\u2019s bipartisan rejection of a Trump-backed gerrymander, despite explicit funding threats, suggests limits to coercion within the GOP\u2014unclear whether this is an isolated revolt or an early sign of broader intra-party resistance.",
    "The administration\u2019s willingness to undercut its own criminal cases (Leonova extradition, AI-chip export posture) in favor of immigration or trade optics raises questions about internal coordination and whether prosecutorial independence can survive such cross-pressures.",
    "The simultaneous erosion of vaccine and environmental protections alongside highly technical, routine regulatory work (FDA, EPA, FCC notices) highlights a dual-track state: one channel for ideological capture, another still operating as a conventional technocracy."

  "summary": "This was a heavy-rotation week for structural authoritarian pressure, with the executive branch aggressively centralizing power while civil society, courts, and some legislatures mounted notable but insufficient pushback. The most consequential moves were Trump\u2019s AI preemption order and broader national security strategy, which together assert sweeping federal supremacy over states, align foreign and tech policy with regime-aligned capital, and weaken independent agencies. Immigration enforcement hardened into a quasi-militarized regime\u2014new deportation aircraft, a militarized border zone, Afghan and veteran detentions, and abuse allegations\u2014deepening stratified citizenship and normalizing security forces as tools of political will. Law was repeatedly weaponized: selective prosecutions of rivals, shielding of allies, pressure on the ICC, and war-crimes-adjacent conduct in the Caribbean. Information systems tilted further toward manipulation via prediction markets in news, media consolidation tied to Trump allies, and a White House bias-reporting campaign. Countervailing forces appeared: courts blocking some deployments and unlawful appointments, Illinois and local actors resisting ICE, Congress conditioning Pentagon funds and bolstering NATO, and Indiana Republicans rejecting gerrymanders. But the net effect is clear: executive overreach, crony capitalism, and coercive immigration policy advanced faster than institutional correctives could contain them.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Centralization of executive authority: Trump\u2019s moves on AI preemption, independent agencies, tariffs, and unilateral military action collectively expand presidential reach at the expense of courts, states, and regulators.",
    "Immigration as a laboratory for authoritarian governance: Mass-deportation infrastructure, militarized border zones, abusive detention, and targeting of specific nationalities entrench a two-tier legal order and normalize rights-free zones.",
    "Crony capitalism and foreign entanglement: Tech export decisions, media mergers backed by foreign sovereign funds, and proxy-advisor attacks show policy being steered toward regime-aligned capital and geopolitical patrons.",
    "Weaponization of law and security institutions: Selective prosecutions, investigations of lawmakers, ICC threats, and war-crimes-adjacent operations illustrate law and force being used to protect insiders and punish critics.",
    "Information environment distortion: Prediction markets in news, partisan media realignment, social media manipulation, and archival battles over Trump\u2019s communications and Epstein files erode shared facts and accountability."
