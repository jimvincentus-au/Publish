      "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power across multiple fronts, with especially heavy pressure on federalism, civil-military boundaries, and the rule of law. Trump\u2019s team used executive orders and threats to reshape elections (move against mail-in voting, cashless bail, redistricting fights), criminalize protest (flag-burning orders), and normalize federal takeovers of Democratic cities via National Guard deployments and new quick-reaction units. Law enforcement and intelligence tools were repeatedly turned on political opponents and immigrants, while whistleblowers and civil servants at FEMA and CDC faced retaliation or removal. Economic policy further blurred the line between state and favored firms through the Intel stake and broader nationalization talk, while labor protections for millions of low-wage, disabled, and federal workers were targeted. At the same time, courts and some state actors pushed back\u2014blocking deportations, closing abusive detention sites, and striking down gerrymanders\u2014showing institutional resistance. But the net structural force of the week is strongly authoritarian: emergency logic, militarized domestic governance, and politicized public health leadership are being entrenched, with inequality and stratified citizenship treated as design features, not side effects.",
