Soft, realistic painting, dramatic side lighting, dark institutional background.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit government complex seen from above, its neoclassical facades intact while interior rooms glow with harsh, uneven light; corridors are being walled off and rerouted, stacks of shredded documents and sealed file boxes line a central atrium, and a large clock on an interior wall reads 8:06 p.m., its face clear but surrounded by scaffolding and security cameras. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors with sharp contrasts between exterior calm and interior constriction."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 29 of Trump\u2019s second term was defined less by a single rupture than by the knitting together of law, force, money, and narrative into a tighter web of control. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:06 p.m., yet core traits of authoritarian governance deepened: law as weapon, executive power without real oversight, and stratified citizenship. In Texas and Indiana, mid\u2011decade gerrymanders backed by threats of arrest, FBI assistance, and retaliatory investigations turned representation into an executive project. At the federal level, the Justice Department and FBI were purged and repurposed, with grand juries and subpoenas aimed at Obama\u2011era officials, Jack Smith, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Economic and immigration policy fused public authority with private gain and carceral expansion, from Medicare favors for donors to vast new ICE contracts and detention complexes. Universities were disciplined through funding threats and data mandates, while official statistics, archives, and human\u2011rights reports were attacked, curated, or quietly altered. The moral floor continued to collapse inside an already darkened hour.",
