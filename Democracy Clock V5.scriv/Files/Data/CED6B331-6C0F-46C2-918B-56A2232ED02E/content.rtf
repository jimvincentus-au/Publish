\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 29 Appendix: Data and Campuses Under Command\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarian governance. The executive branch expanded its reach through a barrage of executive orders, aggressive immigration and policing initiatives, and politicized use of trade, health, and education policy. Multiple moves targeted core guardrails simultaneously: independent data production (BLS firings, crime and vaccine data manipulation), neutral administration of justice (purges and politicized probes at DOJ, FBI, and state AGs), and fair representation (mid\uc0\u8209 decade gerrymanders, census manipulation, and coercive use of law enforcement against legislators). Universities and civil society came under coordinated financial and regulatory pressure, while immigration enforcement infrastructure and detention capacity were rapidly expanded and partially militarized. Economic policy was reoriented around tariffs, crony contracts, and regulatory favors for donors, deepening inequality and embedding crony capitalism. Information and memory systems were also contested: official records and human-rights reporting were altered or withheld, while media and higher education were disciplined. A few countervailing actions\'97judicial checks on the Everglades jail, voting-rights legislation, redistricting walkouts, and oversight subpoenas\'97show institutional resistance, but they are outweighed by the breadth and entrenchment of authoritarian-style practices.\

\
9. Department of Homeland Security issued and then softened a directive linking FEMA aid eligibility to positions on boycotting Israel (2025-08-05): Initially conditioning disaster aid on anti\uc0\u8209 boycott certifications and later rebranding boycotts as discriminatory recast political advocacy as bigotry, influencing public debate and funding access.\
\
10.

\
10. President Donald Trump pressed the Senate to scrap the blue slip tradition for judicial nominees: Urging elimination of home\uc0\u8209 state senators\'92 blue slips sought to strip minority\u8209 party senators of a key tool to influence judicial appointments, centralizing appointment power in the executive and majority leadership. \'97 2025-08-03\
\
11. President Donald Trump urged the Senate to cancel its August recess to accelerate confirmations of his nominees: Pressuring senators to forgo recess to fast\uc0\u8209 track his nominees emphasized loyalty to presidential priorities over regular legislative rhythms and deliberative scrutiny of lifetime appointments. \'97 2025-08-03\

\
15. Trump administration ordered NASA to plan termination of two greenhouse\uc0\u8209 gas monitoring satellite missions: Moving to end functioning climate\u8209 monitoring satellites curtailed high\u8209 quality environmental data used by scientists and regulators, weakening evidence\u8209 based climate policy and public oversight of emissions. \'97 2025-08-05\
\
16.

\
18. President Donald Trump ordered a seven\uc0\u8209 day federal crackdown on violent crime in Washington, D.C.: Deploying federal officers for a week\u8209 long crime crackdown in D.C., despite falling crime rates, normalized emergency\u8209 style interventions in local policing that can be used to project strength and target marginalized groups. \'97 2025-08-08\
\
19.

\
21. President Donald Trump issued an executive order criminalizing public camping and directing institutionalization of unhoused people: Mandating crackdowns on public camping and shifting unhoused people into long\uc0\u8209 term institutions risked criminalizing poverty and weakening civil liberties without addressing structural housing shortages. \'97 2025-08-07\

26. President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Veterans Affairs to move toward banning abortion services at VA hospitals: Seeking to roll back VA abortion care, even in cases of rape or health risk, used executive power to narrow veterans\'92 healthcare rights and deepen geographic disparities in reproductive access. \'97 2025-08-04\
\
27.

\
5. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened removal, felony charges, and seat vacancies for Democratic lawmakers who broke quorum: Seeking to expel or criminally charge opposition legislators for using quorum\uc0\u8209 denial tactics weaponized legal mechanisms to entrench partisan control over redistricting. \'97 2025-08-03\

\
7. Vice President J.D. Vance and the Trump administration pressed Indiana Republicans to pursue mid\uc0\u8209 cycle congressional redistricting favoring the GOP: Encouraging Indiana lawmakers to redraw maps mid\u8209 decade extended a national strategy of partisan cartography, using state legislatures to entrench federal power beyond normal electoral cycles. \'97 2025-08-07\

\
10.

Texas Republicans initiated mid\uc0\u8209 decade congressional redistricting at Trump\'92s request to add GOP\u8209 leaning seats: Launching a special redistricting push mid\u8209 cycle to flip Democratic districts into Republican ones used institutional control to lock in partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 elections. \'97 2025-08-03\

\
2. Meta and private\uc0\u8209 credit lenders pursued a $30 billion private\u8209 credit loan package for AI data\u8209 center expansion: Relying on massive private\u8209 credit financing for critical digital infrastructure deepened corporate leverage and interconnectedness in a lightly supervised corner of the financial system. \'97 2025-08-02\
\

\
4. Federal Communications Commission streamlined delegated authority and removed obsolete telecom regulations: Allowing bureaus to adopt certain rule changes without notice\uc0\u8209 and\u8209 comment and pruning old rules aimed to increase efficiency but also concentrated more discretion in agency staff. \'97 2025-08-04\
\
