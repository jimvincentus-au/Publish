In the background, a removed bust\u2019s dust outline and a folded protest sign lean against a wall where a new, imposing portrait hangs. Light falls sharply from one side, casting long shadows to suggest hierarchy and exclusion.",

In the foreground, a large clock reads 8:00, its inner gears exposed and subtly warped. On one side, immigration buses and riot police surround a crowd of peaceful protesters holding simple signs; on the other, smokestacks and corporate towers glow warmly. Faded murals of civil-rights leaders are being painted over, while distant court buildings stand small on the horizon. The mood is tense and somber, with rich, muted colors."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 22 of Trump\u2019s second term did not feature a single shattering decree so much as a dense accumulation of moves that sharpened hierarchy. Immigration policy became the clearest instrument: arrest quotas, raids in Democratic cities, canceled asylum appointments, and new oversight barriers turned enforcement into partisan punishment, even as wealthy applicants and favored industries received exemptions and a $5 million \u201cTrump Card\u201d to residency. Executive power pressed outward elsewhere, from defying a TikTok divestiture law and asserting veto control over U.S. Steel to keeping coal plants open under a standing \u201cenergy emergency.\u201d Security forces and emergency language were used to police \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests, while rhetoric from officials and a political assassination in Minnesota raised the stakes of dissent. Simultaneously, the administration hollowed out public health and media institutions, dismantling Voice of America, gutting CDC capacity, and editing civic symbols from the MLK bust to the Harvey Milk ship. Courts and parts of Congress clawed back ground in scattered rulings and bills, but the overall pattern was of a state more willing to sort, punish, and reward on its own terms. The Democracy Clock inched forward by 0.3 minutes, its face unchanged at 8:00 p.m., even as the machinery inside grew more brittle.",
