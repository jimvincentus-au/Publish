In Week 35, the pattern that had been forming all term came into sharp relief. Power moved along three converging lines: the law was turned more openly into a weapon, the machinery of science and welfare was stripped for parts, and the channels of information were bent toward a single story. None of these shifts, taken alone, would have forced the Democracy Clock forward by more than a sliver. Together, they showed a government that had stopped treating constraint as a given and had begun to treat it as an obstacle. The week\'92s events did not hinge on a single spectacular order or a single violent clash. They were notable because they reached into so many corners at once\'97immigration courts and television studios, vaccine panels and city police, border hospitals and national parks\'97and in each place the same logic appeared. Those aligned with power would be protected and heard. Those who were not would be sorted, silenced, or made to pay.\
\
At the close of the prior period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:58 p.m. It ends Week 35 at the same public time, 7:58 p.m., but with the hands nudged a fraction closer to nightfall. The net change is a tenth of a minute, almost invisible to the naked eye. That tiny movement reflects a judgment that the week\'92s damage was real and structural, yet not yet decisive. Courts blocked some of the most aggressive moves, as when an appeals court kept Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in her post and other judges shielded Venezuelan TPS holders and Guatemalan children from deportation. Congress, too, showed flashes of resistance, probing the EPA\'92s climate reversals and the FCC\'92s pressure on broadcasters. But the balance of action lay elsewhere. The executive branch defied statutes on TikTok, threatened new emergencies to seize local police, launched an unauthorized strike off Venezuela, and rewrote immigration and science policy by decree. Law enforcement and immigration tools were turned against protesters, journalists, and elected overseers. Broadcast and print media were disciplined through lawsuits, regulatory threats, and corporate fear. The clock did not leap because some guardrails still held. It did not rest either, because the pattern of power was clear.\
\
The most visible front in that pattern was immigration and the stratification of citizenship. On the ground, Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out military-style raids in Los Angeles, sweeping up immigrants and those perceived to be immigrants in unmarked vehicles and leaving communities with memories that echoed earlier eras of mass expulsion. In Illinois, an ICE traffic stop ended with the shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez near a school, prompting calls from the governor and members of Congress for an investigation into the use of force. In Georgia, a raid at a Hyundai plant detained hundreds of Korean workers, many with valid visas, in what officials later called an operational mistake. Detainees in Georgia and Texas described overcrowding, lack of basic supplies, and emotional abuse; a court filing detailed prolonged detention and deprivation at the Dilley family center, in apparent violation of the Flores settlement. In Louisiana, the state reopened Angola\'92s notorious \'93Camp J\'94 as an ICE detention site, blurring the line between civil detention and punitive incarceration. These were not isolated missteps. They showed a system in which poor and nonwhite migrants were treated as presumptive criminals, their legal protections fragile and their bodies subject to harsh confinement.\
\
At the same time, the legal architecture around immigration tilted further toward wealth and ideology. The administration announced a new \'93Gold Card\'94 visa, offering expedited immigrant status in exchange for a million-dollar \'93gift\'94 to the United States, or more for corporations. Days later, the president signed a proclamation imposing an annual $100,000 fee on H\uc0\u8209 1B visas, a move that would price many skilled workers out of the system and strain sectors that rely on them. These measures did not simply raise revenue. They created a formal hierarchy in which the wealthy could buy their way into status while others faced raids, solitary confinement, and even death in custody, as in the case of the ICE detainee who died in Nassau County jail. Visa and deportation tools were also tied to speech. The secretary of state pledged to revoke visas from those who \'93celebrated\'94 Charlie Kirk\'92s killing, and visa revocations were reported underway for immigrants who had expressed such views. An immigration judge ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and pro\u8209 Palestinian activist, over alleged misstatements on a form, even as a federal court stayed his removal. An appeals court ordered the deportation of Mario Guevara, a journalist who had reported on immigration abuses, in a case widely seen as retaliation. In this landscape, citizenship and legal presence were no longer neutral statuses. They were contingent on money, ideology, and the favor of those in power.\
\
The second major development lay in the way executive power pushed past formal checks. In Washington, the president threatened to declare a national emergency to seize control of the District\'92s police if local leaders did not cooperate with mass deportations. This came on the heels of a 30\uc0\u8209 day federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, justified by claims of a crime wave that city officials disputed. In Memphis, National Guard troops were deployed under a \'93Memphis Safe Task Force,\'94 despite historically low crime rates, and a similar deployment was drafted for Louisiana\'92s cities, contingent on a friendly governor\'92s request. These moves normalized the use of military forces and federal agents in routine law enforcement, especially in Democratic\u8209 run or heavily Black urban areas. They also showed how emergency language could be used to override local autonomy, with the threat of renewed takeovers always in the background. The pattern was clear. Federal power would be used most aggressively where political opposition was strongest.\
\
Beyond domestic policing, the executive branch asserted unilateral authority in foreign and economic policy. The president authorized a missile strike on a small boat off Venezuela, killing three people, and then shared video of the strike on social media as proof of toughness on drugs, even as questions about legal authority and evidence went unanswered. He announced efforts to retake Bagram airbase in Afghanistan from the Taliban, framing it as a strategic move against China, without clear congressional debate. In economic policy, the administration pressed the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court ruling that had found his global tariffs illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Court agreed to hear the case on an accelerated schedule, underscoring the stakes for executive control over trade. At the same time, the White House defied both Congress and the Court by again delaying enforcement of a TikTok ban that statute and a prior ruling had required, asserting exclusive authority to decide when and how the law would apply. And in monetary policy, the president tried to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing unproven mortgage allegations, only to be blocked by an appeals court. The administration then petitioned the Supreme Court to bless the firing, challenging the Fed\'92s century\uc0\u8209 old independence. These actions did not yet erase the separation of powers. They did signal an executive willing to test its limits and to treat adverse rulings as obstacles to be worked around rather than as binding law.\
\
The law itself was increasingly deployed as a weapon against dissent. Within the Justice Department, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a criminal civil\uc0\u8209 rights investigation of an Office Depot employee who had refused to print posters bearing Charlie Kirk\'92s image, casting a private refusal as a potential federal offense. She also suggested that employers had an obligation to fire workers who made disparaging comments about Kirk, turning civil\u8209 rights language on its head to justify punishment of speech. The administration discussed bringing RICO charges\'97normally reserved for organized crime\'97against protesters, including pro\u8209 Palestinian demonstrators, and floated an executive order that would use treason and sedition statutes against those associated with \'93antifa.\'94 Stephen Miller, now a senior White House aide, warned that law enforcement power would be turned on political opponents labeled \'93domestic terrorists.\'94 In practice, this posture showed up in the arrests of elected officials in New York who tried to inspect immigration courts, the federal misdemeanor charges against lawmakers and activists who blocked access to an ICE intake facility, and the use of teargas and pepper balls to disperse a Chicago protest outside an ICE building. The message was simple. Oversight and protest would be treated not as democratic acts but as threats to be suppressed.\
\
Courts did not stand aside entirely, but their role was mixed and often reactive. On one side, judges ordered improvements to squalid immigrant holding conditions in Manhattan, blocked the deportation of Guatemalan children with active cases, and upheld temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. A federal judge in Florida dismissed the president\'92s $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times as a rant that failed basic pleading standards, and another ordered Rudy Giuliani to pay over a million dollars in legal fees tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A federal appeals court rejected the attempt to fire Lisa Cook, preserving a measure of central bank independence. On the other side, the Supreme Court allowed warrantless immigration raids based on appearance and accent, opening the door to the Los Angeles sweeps. The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Fani Willis\'92s appeal, leaving the state\'92s election\uc0\u8209 interference case against Trump in limbo. The Justice Department filed briefs seeking to strike down Vermont\'92s Climate Superfund Act, siding with major polluters against state efforts to make them pay for climate damage. And an immigration appeals court ordered Mario Guevara\'92s deportation despite his path to residency and the appearance of retaliation. The judiciary thus appeared as a contested field rather than a stable bulwark, with some judges drawing lines and others enabling or failing to check the new uses of power.\
\
While law and force were being retooled, the administration moved aggressively against the infrastructure of science and public health. At the Environmental Protection Agency, leaders proposed rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding that had recognized greenhouse gases as a threat to human health, thereby undermining the legal basis for federal climate regulation. The agency also moved to dismantle its office of research and development, cutting staff and capacity. In parallel, the Justice Department sought to invalidate Vermont\'92s law requiring major fossil fuel companies to pay for climate\uc0\u8209 related harm, arguing that such state efforts were unconstitutional. In labor policy, the Department of Labor advanced nearly 150 deregulatory actions, including a proposal to strip minimum wage and overtime protections from 3.7 million domestic care workers. It canceled leases and cut international labor grants, including $500 million dedicated to fighting child and forced labor abroad. These moves shifted the state\'92s posture from protecting workers and the climate to shielding employers and polluters, and they did so through formal rulemaking and litigation that would be hard to reverse.\
\
Public health institutions were hit even harder. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, purged the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, removing its existing members and installing new advisers, some with little vaccine experience and others known for questioning vaccine safety. He fired CDC Director Susan Monarez after she resisted pressure to pre\uc0\u8209 approve recommendations from a panel stacked with skeptics and later testified to Congress that she had been dismissed for upholding scientific integrity. The administration canceled a $590 million contract with Moderna for a bird flu vaccine and cut funding for mRNA research more broadly. In Florida, state leaders ended vaccine mandates for children against diseases like measles and polio, with the surgeon general comparing mandates to slavery and invoking divine approval. At the same time, West Coast states formed their own health alliance and issued independent vaccine guidelines, recommending Covid\u8209 19 shots for pregnant people and children in defiance of new federal advice. The ACIP, now reshaped, met and first voted to maintain Vaccines for Children coverage of the combined MMRV shot, then reversed itself the next day and eliminated that coverage, with some members revealing they did not understand the program\'92s purpose. The committee also rejected a proposal to require prescriptions for Covid vaccines but urged \'93individual\u8209 based\'94 decisions and clinician consultations, a stance that could complicate access and insurance coverage. These actions did not merely change policy. They hollowed out the processes by which evidence is gathered and translated into guidance, leaving public health more vulnerable to ideology and confusion.\
\
The social safety net was narrowed at the same time. The president signed a domestic spending bill\'97the \'93One Big, Beautiful Bill\'94\'97that cut Medicaid and the Children\'92s Health Insurance Program by over a trillion dollars, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that at least 10.5 million people, many of them children, would lose coverage over the coming decade. In the Senate, Democrats blocked a House\uc0\u8209 passed stopgap funding bill that failed to protect these programs, raising the risk of a government shutdown but drawing a line against further erosion. Labor\'92s deregulatory push, the Medicaid and CHIP cuts, and the elimination of international child labor grants formed a coherent pattern. The state was retreating from its role in cushioning risk for the poor, the sick, and the young, while leaving intact or expanding tools that served capital and executive discretion. Inequality was not treated as a problem to be solved. It was treated as an acceptable, even useful, outcome.\
\
Information and memory were the third major front. The most dramatic episode centered on late\uc0\u8209 night television. After Jimmy Kimmel criticized those exploiting Charlie Kirk\'92s murder, FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC\'92s broadcast license could be at risk and described Kimmel\'92s comments as part of a \'93concerted effort to lie to the American people.\'94 Nexstar, the largest operator of ABC affiliates, announced it would stop airing Kimmel\'92s show. Disney, ABC\'92s parent company, then pulled the program indefinitely. Sinclair Broadcast Group stepped into the vacated slot with a one\u8209 hour tribute to Kirk, demanding that Kimmel apologize and donate to Turning Point USA. The FCC chair voiced support for Sinclair\'92s demands and, in separate actions, launched investigations into NPR and PBS sponsorships and threatened to block mergers involving companies that pursued diversity and inclusion efforts, even as he approved a Skydance\u8209 Paramount merger that placed a Trump donor as ombudsman at CBS News. House Democrats called for Carr\'92s resignation and opened investigations into ABC, Sinclair, and the FCC, but the immediate effect was clear. A major network had altered its programming under regulatory pressure, and other media companies saw what could happen when they crossed the administration.\
\
The pressure on media was not limited to broadcast licenses. The president filed a $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times, Penguin, and several reporters, accusing them of acting as a partisan mouthpiece. A federal judge dismissed the complaint as invective that failed basic legal standards, but the suit itself, and others like it, signaled a willingness to use civil courts to harass critical outlets. The Washington Post fired columnist Karen Attiah over social media posts about white men and political violence, a move critics saw as capitulation to a hostile climate. An Atlanta journalist, Mario Guevara, faced deportation after reporting on immigration abuses. Abroad, international outlets were excluded from a joint press conference with the British prime minister after the president threatened an ABC journalist. At the same time, the president publicly praised ABC for suspending Kimmel and suggested that networks with negative coverage might face government punishment, even hinting at license revocations that do not exist in law. These actions, taken together, did not yet create a formal censorship regime. They did create a landscape in which editors and executives had to weigh the risk of regulatory retaliation and legal harassment against the value of critical speech.\
\
The administration also moved to control the content of public memory and official knowledge. The Justice Department removed from its website a study showing that far\uc0\u8209 right extremists had committed more ideologically motivated homicides than any other domestic group over three decades, just days after Kirk\'92s killing had been blamed on \'93the Left\'94 by many in power. The FBI director admitted under Senate questioning that he had not reviewed the full Epstein file and refused to say whether the president\'92s name appeared in it. The Department of Labor\'92s chief of staff issued a memo warning employees of \'93serious legal consequences\'94 if they spoke to the media about working conditions, in tension with labor law protections. The administration ordered the removal of slavery\u8209 related exhibits and signage from national parks, including a famous photograph of a formerly enslaved man, and the Education Department partnered with conservative groups to produce programming on patriotism and liberty. These steps did not erase history outright, but they narrowed which histories and data would be visible in official spaces. They made it harder for the public to see patterns of far\u8209 right violence, to remember the brutality of slavery, or to hear from civil servants about internal pressure.\
\
Universities and civil society felt this pressure as well. At Texas A&M, the president resigned after a student complaint about \'93gender ideology\'94 led to the firing of a teacher and the dismissal of a dean and department chair, signaling that political and cultural complaints could reshape academic leadership. The University of California sued the administration over a funding freeze and a $1.2 billion fine on UCLA, arguing that civil\uc0\u8209 rights laws were being twisted to suppress free speech and academic freedom. In the media sphere, educators and journalists who commented critically on Kirk\'92s death faced suspensions and firings, while a Fox News host who had suggested lethal measures for homeless people kept his job after a brief apology. The asymmetry was stark. Speech that challenged the administration or its allies carried professional risk. Speech that dehumanized the vulnerable could be walked back with little consequence.\
\
On the streets and in legislatures, there were signs of resistance. In Minnesota, voters elected Democrat Xp Lee to fill the seat of Melissa Hortman, a state house speaker assassinated by a right\uc0\u8209 wing extremist, restoring a partisan tie and signaling that political violence would not easily overturn electoral will. In Iowa, a county supervisor refused to lower flags for Charlie Kirk, arguing that the state had not shown similar honor to other victims of gun violence. Ninety\u8209 five members of Congress sent a letter condemning the detention and deportation of DACA recipients and demanding transparency from Homeland Security. House Democrats launched investigations into the FCC\'92s role in Kimmel\'92s suspension and into communications between the administration, regulators, and media executives. Senators announced plans for legislation to protect anti\u8209 government speech from censorship. Youth climate activists sued over executive orders that declared a \'93national energy emergency\'94 and sought to \'93unleash\'94 fossil fuels, arguing that the government was creating danger for its own citizens. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s structural moves. They did show that institutional and civic counter\u8209 forces still existed and were learning to read the pattern.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 35, several processes already in motion will test whether those counter\uc0\u8209 forces can hold. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the legality of the president\'92s global tariffs, a case that will define how far a president can go in reshaping trade without Congress. The same Court will be asked to decide whether the president can fire a Federal Reserve governor at will, a ruling that will either preserve or erode the bank\'92s independence. The reconstituted ACIP will continue to vote on vaccine recommendations that determine coverage for millions of children, even as West Coast states chart their own course. Congressional investigations into the FCC, ABC, and Sinclair will probe how far regulatory threats shaped programming decisions. Lawsuits over Vermont\'92s climate law, the University of California\'92s funding, and Maurene Comey\'92s firing will clarify whether courts are willing to check the use of law for political retribution. And in North Carolina, activists are mobilizing against HB 958, a bill that critics say would rig elections, even as the Justice Department sues Oregon and Maine over voter registration data. These are not speculative risks. They are scheduled confrontations that will either deepen or slow the trends visible this week.\
\
By the end of Week 35, the Democracy Clock remains at 7:58 p.m., but the day feels shorter. The week matters not because it brought a single, irreversible break, but because it showed how many systems can be bent at once when a government treats law as a tool, science as an obstacle, and information as a prize. Executive power pressed against its limits through emergency threats, non\uc0\u8209 enforcement of statutes, and unilateral strikes. Law enforcement and immigration machinery were turned against the least protected and against those who tried to oversee them. Public health and environmental agencies were stripped of expertise and authority, even as social programs for children and the poor were cut. Media and memory were curated through lawsuits, regulatory blackmail, and the quiet removal of inconvenient facts. Courts and Congress still offered pockets of resistance, and civil society still found ways to speak and organize. But the net effect was to normalize a more centralized, punitive, and propagandistic form of rule. That is why, even with the hands barely moving, the Democracy Clock records Week 35 as a step toward darkness. The official time at the close of the period is 7:58 p.m. The distance to midnight is still there, but it is thinner, and the work of holding the line has grown heavier.\
