\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 26 Appendix: Loyalty as Operating System\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, centered on three converging fronts: weaponization of the immigration and security apparatus, politicization and hollowing-out of the civil service and justice system, and a coordinated squeeze on independent information and public goods. ICE and DHS policies\'97ending bond hearings, rapid deportations, data-sharing from Medicaid and IRS, raids at workplaces and schools, and abusive detention conditions\'97push hard against due process, equal citizenship, and the idea that security forces protect people rather than power. Simultaneously, Schedule G, mass layoffs and purges at Education, State, DOJ, NIH, and VA, plus politicized judicial nominations and firings of ethics and prosecutorial officials, entrench a loyalty-based state and erode rule-of-law guardrails. Congress largely ratified executive priorities via the rescissions package defunding public broadcasting and foreign aid, while the Supreme Court\'92s emergency stay on Education layoffs and Florida\'92s voting-rights decision deepen institutional complicity. Information control appears in NASA climate suppression, BLS data degradation, Epstein-file opacity, and attacks on public media and critical outlets. There are countervailing sparks\'97courts blocking some refugee and TPS rollbacks, bipartisan pushes for Epstein transparency, robust protest and local violence-prevention innovations\'97but they are outweighed by systemic centralization of power and degradation of neutral institutions.\

Week 26 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1.

\
2. President Donald Trump announced 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico (2025-07-12): The steep unilateral tariffs reoriented U.S. trade policy toward confrontation, with potential knock-on effects for domestic prices, alliances, and the economic context in which voters assess government performance.\
\
3. President Donald Trump claimed he was considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship (2025-07-12): Trump\'92s threat to strip a critic\'92s citizenship, though legally baseless, normalized rhetoric about using state power to punish dissenters and blur constitutional protections of birthright citizenship.\
\
4. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem required her prior approval for FEMA expenditures or contracts of $100,000 or more (2025-07-12): Centralizing sign-off for mid-sized FEMA spending in the secretary\'92s office risked slowing disaster response and concentrated operational discretion over life-saving aid in a single political appointee.\
\
5.

\
9. President Donald Trump announced plans to increase ICE officers and detention facilities to drive undocumented immigrants out of the U.S. (2025-07-15): Expanding ICE personnel and detention capacity entrenched a more punitive immigration regime, increasing the state\'92s coercive reach over noncitizens and mixed-status communities.\
\
10. Trump administration ordered the destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2025-07-15): Incinerating U.S.-funded child nutrition aid on security grounds prioritized a hardline posture over humanitarian obligations, undermining America\'92s moral standing and soft power.\
\
11.

\
14.

\
16. Department of Veterans Affairs leadership removed anti-discrimination language on marital status and political views from hospital bylaws (2025-07-18): Deleting explicit protections against discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation at VA hospitals opened space for viewpoint-based or status-based bias in veterans\'92 access to care.\
\
17.
