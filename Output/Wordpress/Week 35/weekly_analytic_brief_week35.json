  "institutional_shifts": [
    "Executive branch: Expanded its reach over policing, immigration, science, and foreign policy, often in open tension with courts and Congress, signaling a move toward personalized, decree-based rule.",
    "Judiciary: Delivered mixed signals\u2014some robust checks on deportations, TPS rollbacks, detention conditions, and Trump\u2019s NYT lawsuit, but also key rulings enabling warrantless raids and leaving major election cases in limbo.",
    "Congress: Showed both complicity and resistance\u2014House Republicans advanced gerrymanders, DC crime overrides, PFAS rollbacks, and symbolic Kirk resolutions, while Democrats launched oversight on FCC abuses, ICE, and climate lobbying.",
    "Administrative agencies: Health, labor, environmental, and justice agencies were heavily politicized and partially captured, while some independent regulators (FCC career staff, EPA technical processes, FDA rulemakings) continued routine governance in the background.",
    "Media and universities: Major outlets and campuses faced direct political and regulatory pressure, with firings and programming changes signaling that institutional autonomy is increasingly contingent on regime favor."

  "oddities_or_open_questions": [
    "The overlapping but sometimes divergent responses to political violence (Kirk and Hortman killings) reveal a selective security posture; how these asymmetries translate into future legal standards for \u2018domestic terrorism\u2019 remains unclear.",
    "The TikTok enforcement delay, despite a statute and Supreme Court ruling, raises questions about whether other adverse court decisions (tariffs, Fed independence) will simply be slow-walked or ignored in practice.",
    "The extent of corporate complicity versus coercion in media decisions (Disney, ABC, Nexstar, Sinclair) is murky; subpoena-driven investigations may reveal whether regulatory threats or business incentives were the primary drivers."

  "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power and a sharp authoritarian turn in multiple domains. The Trump administration used emergency rhetoric, military deployments, and immigration crackdowns to override local authority (Memphis, DC, Camp 57) while openly defying statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delay, Lisa Cook removal push, tariff litigation). Law is increasingly weaponized: RICO threats against protesters, politicized prosecutions and firings (Maurene Comey, Erik Siebert, Letitia James pressure), and Supreme Court-sanctioned warrantless immigration raids. Simultaneously, the information sphere was hit with a coordinated campaign: FCC threats and corporate compliance produced the effective silencing of Jimmy Kimmel; DOJ removed research on far\u2011right violence; national parks stripped slavery exhibits; and senior officials spread election and violence disinformation. Public health and science governance were gutted via RFK Jr\u2019s purge of vaccine advisory bodies, CDC leadership firing, and EPA\u2019s move to rescind the endangerment finding. Immigration and citizenship were stratified through harsh enforcement, solitary confinement, child detention abuses, TPS fights, and a new pay\u2011to\u2011enter \u201cGold Card\u201d visa. There are pockets of resistance\u2014courts blocking some deportations and Cook\u2019s firing, congressional investigations, state-level vaccine guidance\u2014but the net structural pressure is strongly toward entrenched authoritarian governance.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Militarized and emergency-style governance: National Guard deployments, federal takeovers of local policing, and unilateral overseas strikes normalize using security tools to manage domestic politics and bypass deliberation.",
    "Law as an instrument of regime loyalty: From RICO threats against protesters to politicized prosecutions, immigration raids, and attempts to fire independent officials, legal authority is repurposed to punish opponents and shield allies.",
    "Coordinated media and memory control: FCC threats, corporate cancellations, defamation suits, and removal of inconvenient research and exhibits show a multi-front effort to intimidate media, rewrite history, and narrow permissible discourse.",
    "Deconstruction of science and public health infrastructure: Purging vaccine experts, cancelling key contracts, attacking EPA climate science, and centralizing research control erode evidence-based policymaking and empower ideological control over health.",
    "Stratified citizenship and punitive immigration regime: Warrantless raids, solitary confinement, abusive detention, selective deportations, and wealth-based visas deepen a hierarchy of rights based on status, wealth, and political conformity."
