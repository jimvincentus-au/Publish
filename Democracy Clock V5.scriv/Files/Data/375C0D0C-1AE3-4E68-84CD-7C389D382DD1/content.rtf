Week 7 unfolds as a week of acceleration without a lurch. The surface picture is of a government in constant motion: executive orders, tariff swings, agency restructurings, and court rulings arriving in dense succession. Underneath, a clearer pattern emerges. Executive power is stretched across budget, foreign aid, and trade; civil service is pared back and replaced; and financial policy is bent toward the interests of a narrow circle. At the same time, courts, some independent boards, and pockets of Congress still push back. The result is not a dramatic plunge but a deepening groove. The state increasingly serves the ruler and his allies first, while the older machinery of neutral governance is hollowed out or repurposed. It is a week in which chaos is not an accident but a method, and in which the line between public office and private gain grows thinner.\
\
At the close of Week 6, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:32 p.m. It remains there in Week 7, but the underlying measure moves by 0.2 minutes toward midnight. The public time does not change because the shift is small, yet the direction is clear. The clock moves because several traits that mark democratic erosion all tick upward together: executive power operating without effective oversight, law used as a weapon rather than a limit, foreign influence welcomed when it suits the regime, and civil service roles politicized or privatized. Courts and oversight bodies win some important rulings, enough to keep the week from registering as a larger jump. But those rulings are defensive, not generative. They slow the slide; they do not reverse it. The balance of power continues to tilt toward a presidency that treats law, money, and information as tools of personal rule.\
\
The first major development is the assault on the professional civil service and the quiet privatization of public functions. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, drives mass layoffs across agencies. At the Social Security Administration, plans to consolidate ten regional offices into four and cut at least 7,000 jobs are announced, with outside observers warning that millions of beneficiaries could see delays or errors in their payments. The Department of Veterans Affairs prepares to fire more than 80,000 employees, even as veteran care needs rise. Internal memos confirm the scale of the cuts, and critics describe the plan as a prelude to privatization. At the Department of Education, workers are offered buyouts ahead of a looming reduction in force, and nearly $900 million in research funding is canceled. These moves weaken the state\'92s capacity to deliver basic services and to gather the data needed for fair policy. Power shifts from career staff with statutory duties to political appointees and, increasingly, to private contractors who will fill the gaps on terms favorable to them. The civil service becomes thinner, more precarious, and easier to bend.\
\
The same pattern appears at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Inter-American Foundation. At CFPB, nearly all staff are placed on indefinite administrative leave after Russell Vought takes over as acting head. Internal emails instruct employees to ignore legally mandated supervision and examination activities, even as the agency tells a federal court that it is still fulfilling its duties. Judge Amy Berman Jackson orders the bureau\'92s chief operating officer to appear in an evidentiary hearing, a rare step that underscores how far the agency has drifted from its statutory mission. At the Inter-American Foundation, the White House fires the president and CEO, dissolves the bipartisan board, and installs a single Trump loyalist, Peter Marocco, as both head and sole board member. Most staff are put on paid leave, local grantees are told their contracts will end, and the agency\'92s website is taken offline. In both cases, institutions created by Congress to serve public purposes are hollowed out and placed under tight political control. The law still exists on paper, but its enforcement depends on actors who now answer primarily to the president. State power is pushed outward to private firms and inward to loyalists.\
\
Courts and independent boards do not stand idle, but their victories are partial and fragile. The Merit Systems Protection Board orders the temporary reinstatement of nearly 6,000 probationary employees at the Department of Agriculture, finding reasonable grounds to believe their mass firing violated federal law. A federal court issues a temporary injunction halting mass firings of probationary employees at the Department of Education, again signaling that even those with limited tenure have rights. In the labor sphere, a federal court rules that Donald Trump\'92s abrupt firing of National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox was illegal and orders her reinstated, emphasizing that the president is not above the National Labor Relations Act. These decisions preserve pockets of civil service protection and agency independence. Yet they also reveal the new normal. Legal safeguards are activated only after large-scale damage is attempted, and compliance is not guaranteed. In the case of transgender prisoners, for example, the Bureau of Prisons continues to transfer trans women into men\'92s facilities and restrict gender-affirming care despite multiple court rulings against the policy. Enforcement of judicial orders now depends on executive willingness, not just doctrine.\
\
The second major development is the consolidation of executive control over money and foreign policy, often at the expense of Congress. The administration impounds congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, in defiance of the Impoundment Control Act, and pauses over $1 billion in military assistance after a contentious Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky. It also stops financing new weapons sales to Ukraine and considers freezing shipments from U.S. stockpiles. At the same time, Secretary of State Marco Rubio invokes emergency authorities to send $4 billion in arms to Israel, including heavy bombs, bypassing the usual congressional review. A separate nearly $3 billion arms sale to Israel is approved without standard oversight, even as the U.S. supports an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza. These moves show a presidency that claims unilateral control over when and how force is supported abroad, treating Congress\'92s power of the purse as optional. Emergency powers, meant for rare crises, slide into routine tools.\
\
The judiciary pushes back on the budget front. The Supreme Court, in a narrow 5\'964 decision, rejects the administration\'92s attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, upholding a lower court\'92s order that the funds must flow as Congress directed. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett join the liberal justices, prompting attacks from the right but preserving, for now, the basic rule that appropriations cannot be undone by executive order. District judges in other cases extend injunctions preventing the administration from freezing congressionally approved funds and order the release of some USAID payments. These rulings keep the formal separation of powers intact. Yet the fact that such freezes were attempted at all, and that aid programs have already laid off staff and severed ties with local partners, shows how much damage can be done before the courts speak. Executive power operates without effective oversight not because oversight has vanished, but because it is always late and always contested. The presidency moves first; the law trails behind.\
\
A third development is the fusion of public financial policy with the interests of a tight circle of donors and insiders. The most striking example is the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. Through executive orders and public announcements, the administration commits the government to acquiring and holding large quantities of specific cryptocurrencies\'97Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano\'97some of which are heavily held by Trump allies and donors. David Sacks, appointed as \'93crypto czar,\'94 has investments in firms that stand to benefit from these choices, including Bitwise Asset Management. Ripple, the issuer of XRP, has given millions to Trump\'92s inauguration fund and to a pro-crypto super PAC, and its CEO has cultivated personal ties with the president. At the same time, the Treasury Department halts enforcement of a Biden-era anti\'96money laundering rule designed to pierce shell companies, and the administration halts the fraud prosecution of Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto magnate who bought large quantities of Trump-branded memecoins. The pattern is stark. Law and regulation are relaxed where they constrain favored actors, and public balance sheets are committed to assets that enrich those same actors. Wealth does not just buy access; it shapes the law itself.\
\
Tariff policy follows a similar logic of volatility and insider advantage. On March 4, the administration imposes sweeping 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and doubles tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. Officials frame the move as defending American workers and addressing fentanyl flows, but the immediate effects are market turmoil, retaliatory tariffs from Canada, China, and Mexico, and warnings from retailers about sharp price increases. The Atlanta Federal Reserve revises its forecast from solid growth to a 2.8% annualized contraction, and stock indices fall. Within days, the administration carves out exemptions for car and truck parts and goods compliant with the USMCA, then pauses tariffs on a range of goods until April 2, and finally threatens new tariffs again. Analysts note that this whiplash creates uncertainty that can be exploited by those with advance knowledge. The public bears the risk in higher prices and job losses; insiders keep the upside. The Democracy Clock registers this as a deepening of crony capitalism, not because every tariff decision is corrupt, but because the pattern of chaos and selective relief serves those closest to power.\
\
A fourth development is the reorientation of foreign and security policy toward Russia\'92s interests and away from traditional democratic alliances. In cyber defense, the administration orders U.S. Cyber Command to halt planning and operations against Russian targets, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency instructs analysts to stop reporting on Russian threats, including to election systems. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\'92s order to pause cyber operations against Russia is publicly denied by the Pentagon, but reporting and subsequent clarifications confirm that offensive actions have been curtailed. In the diplomatic arena, the U.S. votes against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia\'92s aggression in Ukraine, aligning itself with Moscow and a small group of states. The administration draws up plans to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions, while simultaneously pausing aid to Ukraine, cutting off intelligence sharing that enables Ukrainian targeting of Russian positions, and restricting U.S. satellite imagery support. A Kremlin spokesperson openly welcomes the shift, saying U.S. policy now aligns with Russia\'92s vision. Foreign influence is not merely tolerated; it is welcomed when it fits regime goals.\
\
Allies respond by stepping away. European leaders gather in London to reaffirm support for Ukraine, with the UK and France announcing new aid packages and warning about the threat posed by Putin. Canada, China, and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. trade moves, and some allied governments begin to consider withholding sensitive intelligence from Washington for fear it could be shared with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron tells his country that Europe must prepare to defend itself without U.S. partnership. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, prepares to close a dozen consulates in Western Europe and reduce its global workforce by at least 10%, including in human rights and global criminal justice bureaus. Hundreds of career diplomats resign. The foreign policy apparatus that once anchored a pro-democracy security architecture is deliberately shrunk, and the space it leaves is filled by transactional deals and public gestures toward Moscow. The cost is borne in frayed alliances and a thinner shield for democracies under threat.\
\
The fifth development is the stratification of citizenship and rights along lines of language, origin, ideology, and identity. On March 1, the president signs an executive order making English the official language of the United States and revoking a Clinton-era order that required agencies and federally funded entities to provide language assistance to people with limited English proficiency. The order does not ban multilingual services outright, but it signals that such services are now discretionary, not a federal obligation. Non-English speakers, especially immigrants and refugees, are left more dependent on the goodwill of individual agencies and local governments. In immigration enforcement, the administration mobilizes officers from nearly every federal law enforcement agency and the military to carry out mass deportations, reopens a migrant family detention center in Texas, and celebrates a clampdown on asylum in a televised address to Congress. It also plans, then walks back, the revocation of temporary legal status for roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who fled Russia\'92s invasion, and considers a new travel ban targeting countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. Legal status becomes a lever, not a shield.\
\
At the same time, the State Department begins revoking student visas based on AI-assisted scans of social media posts deemed supportive of Hamas, under an executive order framed as combating antisemitism. Non-citizen students who participate in pro-Palestinian protests or share certain content online face deportation, even when their actions would be protected speech for citizens. A German tourist is detained for over a month, including eight days in solitary confinement, on disputed allegations that she intended to work illegally as a tattoo artist. An immigration judge in Texas denies asylum to a torture survivor from Turkey despite the Department of Homeland Security not opposing his claim. In prisons, transgender women are transferred to men\'92s facilities and denied gender-affirming care despite court orders to the contrary. Together, these actions create a hierarchy of belonging. Some groups\'97white Afrikaners in South Africa, for example, whose alleged discrimination is cited as grounds to suspend U.S. aid\'97are singled out for protection, while others\'97migrants, Muslims, Ukrainians, Palestinians, trans people\'97find their rights contingent and revocable.\
\
Universities and schools become a central battleground in this stratification. The administration cuts off $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing its failure to combat antisemitism, and opens a civil rights investigation into the University of California system over alleged antisemitic hostile work environments tied to Gaza protests. The interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia sends letters to Georgetown University and its law school demanding an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and warning that his office will not hire graduates from institutions that continue such programs. On social media, the president threatens to halt federal funding for colleges that allow \'93illegal protests\'94 and to expel or arrest student \'93agitators.\'94 Meanwhile, a donor-funded pastor tours school board meetings across the country, demanding the removal of books with LGBTQ content and using inflammatory rhetoric that often leads to his removal by police, which he then frames as persecution. These actions do not yet amount to a formal censorship regime, but they use money, hiring power, and law enforcement to pressure educational institutions to narrow the range of acceptable ideas. Civic education is hollowed out and replaced with ideological tests.\
\
Congress, for its part, functions more as a stage than as a deliberative body. The president\'92s address to a joint session is structured as a campaign rally, with curated guests meant to dramatize his positions on immigration and transgender issues. He repeats false claims about Ukraine aid, Social Security, and a Florida school case, while Republicans offer standing ovations and many Democrats walk out. Representative Al Green, who heckles the president and challenges his claim of a mandate, is ordered removed from the chamber by the Speaker and later censured by a 224\'96198 vote, with ten Democrats joining Republicans. The House also passes a budget resolution that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, can only achieve its mandated $880 billion in cuts by slashing Medicare, Medicaid, or children\'92s health programs, despite public promises to protect them. In the states, Republican lawmakers introduce bills aimed at undermining same-sex marriage, while in Montana a coalition of Republicans and Democrats defeats two extreme anti-trans bills. The legislative branch still contains pockets of resistance and compromise, but at the federal level its central role this week is to provide a backdrop for executive spectacle and to advance fiscal blueprints that entrench inequality.\
\
Against this backdrop, there are also signs of civic and institutional resilience. Thousands protest anti-trans legislation in Iowa and broader anti-democratic policies across the country. Bishop William Barber organizes a march from St. Mark\'92s Episcopal Church to the Supreme Court, framing it as a call for moral resistance to injustice and corruption. In Vermont and Texas, Republican lawmakers face angry constituents over cuts to the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration\'92s treatment of Ukraine. In Montana, trans legislators speak forcefully against bills that would ban drag shows and allow the state to remove transgender children from their parents, and enough Republicans join them to defeat the measures. The American Bar Association issues a statement condemning intimidation of judges. Newsmax discloses a $40 million settlement with Smartmatic over false election claims, a reminder that courts can still impose costs on media outlets that spread disinformation. These actions do not change the structural direction of the week, but they show that the moral and civic floor has not yet collapsed. Resistance remains organized, visible, and grounded in law and conscience.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 7, several scheduled or ongoing processes bear watching. The Supreme Court and lower federal courts will continue to hear cases on foreign aid freezes, mass firings, and agency shutdowns, including the CFPB\'92s effective closure and the legality of large-scale reductions in force at Education, Agriculture, and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office has been asked to investigate the mass firing of probationary federal employees and the role of private companies in filling the resulting gaps. The Election Assistance Commission is taking public comment on the national mail voter registration form, while Congress prepares to vote on the SAVE Act, which could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly women who changed their names. In foreign policy, the administration\'92s plans to close consulates in Europe and to restore ties with Russia, along with its evolving tariff schedule, will continue to reshape alliances and economic conditions. The architecture of the crypto reserve and digital asset stockpile remains opaque and will require close scrutiny as regulations and acquisitions proceed. Each of these arenas will test whether formal checks can still bite.\
\
In the larger arc of the term, Week 7 matters because it shows how an authoritarian drift can advance through ordinary instruments: budget resolutions, executive orders, hiring and firing decisions, and the selective enforcement or non-enforcement of existing law. The Democracy Clock remains at 7:32 p.m., but the small movement beneath that still time reflects a system in which executive power is increasingly unchecked in practice, even as courts and some institutions continue to assert their formal roles. Civil service is thinned and politicized; agencies are captured or sidelined; financial policy is tailored to insiders; and citizenship is stratified by origin, ideology, and identity. At the same time, resistance persists in courts, legislatures, universities, and the streets. The question the clock poses is not whether democracy has vanished, but whether these countervailing forces can do more than slow the erosion. At the end of Week 7, with the clock still reading 7:32 p.m., the record shows a democracy under sustained pressure, held back from steeper decline only by institutions that are themselves under attack.\
