This chapter reframes democracy not as a set of procedures or intentions, but as a system judged by its deliverables. It argues that a republic’s legitimacy rests on six civic outcomes citizens should be able to experience directly: care in times of vulnerability; education and elevation that enable participation and mobility; safety, justice, and freedom as an inseparable triad; belonging that crosses lines of identity; foresight that protects future generations; and endurance that allows institutions to weather conflict without losing integrity. The text traces how each deliverable has evolved historically and how its absence creates openings for fear, manipulation, and authoritarian temptation. Rather than treating these as isolated goals, the chapter presents them as an interdependent system whose failures accumulate slowly, eroding trust. Democracy, in this view, survives only when authority and legitimacy converge in the everyday lives of the governed.
