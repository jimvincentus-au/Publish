# Week 20 Appendix: Inequality as Operating System

This was a structurally heavy week of authoritarian consolidation across multiple fronts. The Trump administration advanced a sweeping agenda of executive overreach (impoundment threats, mass federal layoffs, travel bans, Harvard visa suspension), while the House pushed through the “Big, Beautiful Bill” and related reconciliation measures that slash social supports, preempt state AI regulation, and carve out industry favors. Immigration enforcement escalated into mass warrantless arrests, collateral detentions, and high-profile raids, paired with military deployment against largely peaceful protests—deepening the fusion of security forces with regime priorities. Information control and memory politics intensified: censorship of VA scientists, Pentagon press lockouts, removal of Jackie Robinson and Harvey Milk honors, and open presidential promotion of conspiracy theories. Courts delivered a mixed picture: some rulings defended due process and speech, but the Supreme Court repeatedly used emergency orders to greenlight data grabs, DOGE operations, and executive removals. Social stratification hardened via expansive travel bans, attacks on LGBTQ and reproductive rights, and budget choices that systematically target the poor, children, veterans, and immigrants. Overall, the week exerts strong positive pressure toward centralized, personalized, and punitive rule.

Week 20 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump announced and signed orders doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports (2025-06-02): Trump’s decision to sharply raise steel and aluminum tariffs used unilateral trade powers with major downstream economic effects, testing how far executive authority can reshape markets without new legislative approval.

2. President Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought signaled plans to bypass Congress using impoundment and other tools to cut federal spending and jobs (2025-06-01): By floating use of impoundment and executive tools to impose deep federal workforce and spending cuts, the administration tested limits on the president’s ability to override Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.

3. President Trump ordered investigations into Joe Biden’s pardons and overall presidency citing alleged cognitive decline (2025-06-05): Launching executive and Justice Department inquiries into a predecessor’s competence and clemency decisions risked turning prosecutorial power into a tool for delegitimizing prior administrations and their lawful acts.

4. President Trump rescinded Biden-era emergency abortion guidance under EMTALA (2025-06-05): Ending enforcement of guidance that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions narrowed federal protection for life‑saving care, shifting life‑or‑death decisions toward state bans and away from national standards.

5. President Trump issued sweeping travel bans on nationals from multiple countries and restricted foreign students at Harvard (2025-06-05): New proclamations barring entry from 12 countries and suspending Harvard’s foreign student visas concentrated immigration and education control in the presidency, with discriminatory impacts on targeted nationalities and institutions.

6. President Trump ordered an investigation into Biden-era spending and requested rescission of $9.4 billion in approved funds (2025-06-05): The rescission package targeting public media and foreign aid used executive initiative to claw back congressionally approved funds, pressuring lawmakers and signaling willingness to weaponize budget tools against disfavored programs.

7.

9. President Trump used pardons and Justice Department directives to nullify January 6 prosecutions and removed related prosecutors (2025-06-03): Mass pardons for January 6 defendants and firing prosecutors who handled those cases signaled tolerance for political violence and weakened the Justice Department’s independence in enforcing accountability for attacks on Congress.

10. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USNS Harvey Milk renamed and planned a personal military parade (2025-06-03): Renaming a ship honoring a gay rights icon and staging a birthday military parade used symbolic military decisions to advance culture‑war goals and personalize state power displays.

11. President Trump threatened to terminate Elon Musk’s government contracts and subsidies after political disagreements (2025-06-06): Threats to cancel major federal contracts with Musk’s companies over policy disputes showed how procurement and subsidies could be wielded as personal leverage rather than neutral tools of public administration.

12.

Economic Structure

1. Trump administration proposed deep cuts to Medicaid, ACA coverage, NIH, VA medical services, and other health programs (2025-06-06): Budget proposals slashing Medicaid, ACA subsidies, NIH research, and VA medical services would shift health costs onto individuals and private markets, weakening public health infrastructure and widening inequality.
