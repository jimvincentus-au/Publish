<h1>Week 36 Appendix: Law, Hunger, and Silence as Leverage</h1>
<p><em>With the clock frozen, the administration deepened its use of law, security, and data to punish critics, coerce states, and narrow who counts as fully protected.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The most structurally significant moves were the weaponization of law enforcement and prosecution (Comey and Brennan actions, Homan cover‑up, Halligan appointment, DOJ voter‑data suits), the formalization of dissent-as-terrorism (Antifa designation and domestic terrorism memorandum), and the tightening of information control (Pentagon press pledges, FCC threats, Kimmel saga, economic data suppression). Executive–legislative balance eroded further through unilateral foreign strikes, foreign-aid redirection, TikTok defiance of statute and court, and Supreme Court stays that expand presidential reach over independent agencies and appropriated funds. Immigration and civil-rights policy were used as tools of stratified citizenship and political retribution, with ICE mass detention of non‑criminals, high-profile detentions, and huge deportation funding. Climate and housing civil-rights enforcement were rolled back while green and preservation funds were clawed back, deepening regulatory capture and inequality. There were pockets of resistance—federal court pushback on grants and emergency funds, state and regional public-health alliances, congressional oversight on Homan and ICE deaths, and Adelita Grijalva’s election—but these were outweighed by coordinated efforts to politicize the civil service, intimidate lawyers and media, and normalize chaos as a governing strategy.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization: By labeling Antifa a domestic terrorist organization despite the lack of a clear legal framework, the president expanded executive power to treat loosely defined political dissent as terrorism, enabling broader surveillance and criminalization of protest activity. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>President Trump issued a presidential memorandum targeting alleged leftwing domestic terror networks: The memorandum directing multi‑agency investigations of a supposed radical left domestic “terror network” broadened security powers against activists and nonprofits, blurring lines between counterterrorism and suppression of political opposition. (2025-09-25)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered a lethal strike on a Venezuelan vessel without providing supporting evidence: Ordering a lethal strike on a Venezuelan boat while withholding evidence from Congress and the public weakened democratic oversight of the use of force and raised questions about compliance with domestic and international law. (2025-09-21)</li>
<li>President Trump threatened Venezuela and Afghanistan with punitive actions on social media: Public threats against Venezuela and Afghanistan over prisoners and Bagram Air Base signaled a personalized, coercive approach to foreign policy that sidelines diplomatic process and congressional war‑powers constraints. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>President Trump signed executive orders delaying and restructuring the TikTok ban contrary to statute and court rulings: By repeatedly delaying a congressionally mandated TikTok ban and dictating divestiture terms despite a Supreme Court ruling, the president asserted unilateral control over digital infrastructure in defiance of legislative and judicial limits. (2025-09-25)</li>
<li>President Trump publicly pressured the Justice Department to prosecute named political opponents: Calling on the attorney general to indict specific critics, including Letitia James, James Comey, and Adam Schiff, undermined prosecutorial independence and framed law enforcement as a tool for punishing political enemies. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>President Trump threatened legal action against media critics and claimed negative coverage was illegal: Declaring that negative coverage of his administration was &quot;really illegal&quot; and calling for prosecution of hecklers and comedians signaled a willingness to criminalize criticism, chilling free expression. (2025-09-21)</li>
<li>President Trump canceled meetings with Democratic leaders on government funding negotiations: Canceling bipartisan budget talks while a shutdown loomed used brinkmanship to pressure Congress, risking disruption of federal services and weakening norms of cooperative budgeting. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought threatened mass firings of federal employees in the event of a shutdown: Threatening to fire, rather than furlough, large numbers of civil servants during a shutdown weaponized budget impasses to intimidate the federal workforce and reshape agencies along political lines. (2025-09-25)</li>
<li>President Trump announced steep new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, furniture, and trucks: Imposing sweeping tariffs despite prior court limits on his trade authority concentrated economic power in the executive and risked using trade tools for political or personal agendas rather than transparent policy goals. (2025-09-25)</li>
<li>President Trump directed agencies to prepare for large‑scale reductions in force tied to his budget priorities: Ordering agencies to plan permanent layoffs for programs not aligned with presidential priorities in a shutdown scenario threatened to purge the civil service based on ideology rather than merit or statutory mandate. (2025-09-25)</li>
<li>President Trump used public speeches at the United Nations to attack multilateralism, migration, and climate policy: Using the UN platform to denounce a &quot;globalist migration agenda,&quot; green energy, and allied leaders advanced a nationalist narrative that undermines cooperative international norms and reframes global institutions as adversaries. (2025-09-23)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked 37 security clearances without notifying the White House: Revoking dozens of security clearances, including for senior intelligence officials and congressional staff, without normal coordination suggested use of classification powers for political retribution and disrupted interbranch oversight of intelligence. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>Democratic lawmakers introduced a reform package including a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United: Proposing to reverse Citizens United and restore campaign‑finance limits sought to reduce the dominance of corporate money in elections and strengthen democratic accountability. (2025-09-20)</li>

(2025-09-20)</li>
<li>U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday dismissed President Trump’s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times: Dismissing an expansive defamation suit and criticizing its abusive rhetoric reinforced judicial protections for press freedom against attempts by a sitting president to weaponize civil courts against media critics. (2025-09-19)</li>
<li>Federal courts nationwide blocked over 100 Trump administration policies in more than 400 lawsuits: Extensive litigation that halted numerous administration policies and reinstated civil servants and CDC funding illustrated the judiciary’s role as a counterweight to executive overreach. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law banning most law enforcement officers from covering their faces on duty: Prohibiting face coverings for most officers, including federal immigration agents, aimed to increase transparency and accountability in policing, countering opaque enforcement practices. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>Democratic members of Congress launched oversight inquiries into bribery allegations against border official Tom Homan: Seeking documents on an undercover FBI bribery sting involving Tom Homan after DOJ closed the case reflected legislative efforts to revive stalled corruption probes and scrutinize politicized non‑prosecution decisions. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>Supreme Court of the United States granted a stay allowing President Trump to keep Rebecca Slaughter out of her FTC post: Staying a lower‑court order reinstating an FTC commissioner let the president’s contested firing stand during appeal, signaling judicial openness to expanded presidential control over independent regulators. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>Department of Justice leadership under Trump drastically reduced staffing in the Public Integrity Section: Shrinking DOJ’s Public Integrity Section from 36 attorneys to two severely weakened federal capacity to investigate corruption by public officials, undermining a key institutional safeguard. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>House Judiciary Committee Republicans voted against subpoenaing major bank CEOs over Jeffrey Epstein transactions: Refusing to compel testimony and records from banks handling Epstein‑linked funds limited congressional scrutiny of possible financial complicity in abuse and signaled protection of powerful institutions. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>House Oversight Committee leadership delayed release of records related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation: Slow‑walking the release of Epstein records, reportedly containing references to President Trump, raised concerns that congressional oversight was being used to shield politically sensitive information. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>FBI Director Kash Patel refused to answer congressional questions about his appearance in Epstein records: Declining to address lawmakers’ questions about his own mention in Epstein‑related documents deepened doubts about FBI transparency in a high‑profile abuse case involving elite figures. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>Federal judiciary blocked the Trump administration from conditioning emergency grants on immigration cooperation: A ruling that federal conditions on emergency management grants were unconstitutional and arbitrary protected state autonomy and limited the executive’s ability to coerce immigration policy through funding threats. (2025-09-24)</li>
<li>North Carolina General Assembly passed a controversial crime bill prompting a Senate walkout: Enacting a sweeping crime bill over opposition walkouts highlighted partisan use of state legislative power to reshape criminal justice policy with potential implications for civil liberties and enforcement discretion. (2025-09-24)</li>
<li>House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21: Approving a short‑term funding bill with narrow margins temporarily averted a shutdown from the House side, but partisan divisions and Senate resistance left federal operations at continued risk. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>United States Senate failed to pass the House’s continuing resolution to fund the government: Senate rejection of the House funding bill, amid disputes over health‑care subsidies, increased the likelihood of a shutdown and underscored gridlock in the budget process. (2025-09-19)</li>
<li>Trump administration officials signaled expectation of a government shutdown that would disproportionately affect Democratic constituencies: Treating a looming shutdown as a political weapon expected to hurt opposing constituencies framed core government operations as leverage in partisan conflict rather than a neutral public service. (2025-09-26)</li>
<li>Supreme Court of the United States stayed lower‑court orders requiring continuation of foreign aid under Executive Order 14169: Allowing the administration to pause billions in congressionally appropriated foreign aid while litigation proceeds strengthened executive leverage over spending decisions traditionally controlled by Congress.

<li>State Department and Treasury Department under Trump redirected and prepared large foreign aid packages outside normal appropriations channels: Plans to reallocate $1.8 billion in foreign aid and prepare a $20 billion package for Argentina without standard congressional processes blurred legal lines on appropriations and tied aid more closely to ideological allies.

<li>National Archives and Records Administration improperly released nearly unredacted military records of Rep.

(2025-09-25)</li>

(2025-09-24)</li>

<h3>Economic Structure</h3>
<ol>
<li>U.S. Department of Agriculture under Trump canceled the annual national food insecurity survey and household food security report: Ending longstanding USDA food insecurity reporting removed a key data source for targeting nutrition programs, weakening evidence‑based policymaking on hunger during a period of economic strain. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>U.S. Department of Agriculture froze over $10 million in food assistance funding for Kansas over a data‑sharing dispute: Suspending food assistance funds because Kansas refused to share beneficiaries’ personal data used federal resources punitively, risking harm to low‑income residents to pressure a state government. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>Trump administration rolled back climate protections and halted or delayed over 150 renewable energy initiatives: Curtailing grants and projects for solar and wind energy reversed progress on decarbonization and undercut job‑creating clean‑energy investments, privileging fossil‑fuel interests over long‑term public and economic health. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>Trump administration appointees at HUD rolled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and imposed gag orders on staff: Weakening HUD’s fair‑housing enforcement, reassigning staff, and discouraging discrimination cases eroded protections against segregation and domestic‑violence‑related housing bias, deepening structural inequality. (2025-09-22)</li>
<li>President Trump announced a $100,000 fee for companies employing H‑1B visa workers: Imposing a massive fee on employers of H‑1B workers raised barriers to skilled immigration, potentially disrupting labor markets and using economic policy to signal hostility toward foreign workers. (2025-09-21)</li>
<li>Department of Homeland Security proposed overhauling the H‑1B visa lottery to favor higher‑paid applicants: Prioritizing higher‑paid H‑1B applicants would tilt skilled immigration further toward elite employers and wealthier workers, reinforcing class‑based access to U.S. opportunities.

(2025-09-25)</li>
<li>U.S. Congress allocated $170 billion to ICE over four years to support mass deportations: Committing unprecedented funding to deport one million immigrants annually entrenched a resource‑intensive enforcement model that prioritizes removal over integration or due‑process safeguards.

(2025-09-21)</li>

</ol>
<h3>Civil Rights and Dissent</h3>
<ol>
<li>FBI and DOJ leadership under Trump closed a bribery investigation into border czar Tom Homan despite recorded evidence: Shutting down a case where Homan was recorded accepting $50,000 from undercover agents, and later denying he took the money, signaled selective non‑enforcement for powerful insiders and weakened deterrence against corruption. (2025-09-20)</li>
<li>President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi forced out U.S. attorney Erik Siebert and installed loyalist Lindsey Halligan in his place: Removing a prosecutor who declined to charge Trump’s critics and replacing him with a former personal lawyer lacking prosecutorial experience politicized a key U.S. attorney’s office and paved the way for targeted prosecutions. (2025-09-23)</li>
<li>Department of Justice under Lindsey Halligan secured a federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress: Indicting a prominent Trump critic on contested charges after career prosecutors had declined the case exemplified the use of criminal law to punish perceived enemies and intimidate future oversight witnesses.

</ol>
<h3>Information, Memory and Manipulation</h3>
<ol>
