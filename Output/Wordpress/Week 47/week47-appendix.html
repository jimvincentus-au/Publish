<h1>Week 47 Appendix: Citizenship and Power for Sale</h1>
<p><em>A week of hardened borders, leader-centric security, and AI-era crony capitalism, where resistance held the clock still but not the moral floor.</em></p>
<p>This was a heavy-rotation week for structural authoritarian pressure, with the executive branch aggressively centralizing power while civil society, courts, and some legislatures mounted notable but insufficient pushback. The most consequential moves were Trump’s AI preemption order and broader national security strategy, which together assert sweeping federal supremacy over states, align foreign and tech policy with regime-aligned capital, and weaken independent agencies. Immigration enforcement hardened into a quasi-militarized regime—new deportation aircraft, a militarized border zone, Afghan and veteran detentions, and abuse allegations—deepening stratified citizenship and normalizing security forces as tools of political will. Law was repeatedly weaponized: selective prosecutions of rivals, shielding of allies, pressure on the ICC, and war-crimes-adjacent conduct in the Caribbean. Information systems tilted further toward manipulation via prediction markets in news, media consolidation tied to Trump allies, and a White House bias-reporting campaign. Countervailing forces appeared: courts blocking some deployments and unlawful appointments, Illinois and local actors resisting ICE, Congress conditioning Pentagon funds and bolstering NATO, and Indiana Republicans rejecting gerrymanders. But the net effect is clear: executive overreach, crony capitalism, and coercive immigration policy advanced faster than institutional correctives could contain them.</p>
