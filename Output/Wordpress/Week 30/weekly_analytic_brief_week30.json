  "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with Washington, D.C. effectively used as a laboratory for federal overreach. Trump\u2019s declaration of a crime emergency, repeated deployments of National Guard and federal agents, and attempted federalization of the D.C. police (wk030-023, -048, -049, -095, -122\u2013125) push hard on emergency normalization, federal weaponization against disfavored jurisdictions, and the alignment of security forces with regime priorities (traits 1, 5, 9, 11). Parallel moves\u2014threats to overturn D.C. home rule (wk030-012), prosecution threats to sanctuary cities (wk030-107, -128), and the use of immigration raids with lethal consequences (wk030-138)\u2014extend this pattern nationwide. Institutional guardrails respond unevenly: courts restore a spending database and democracy funding, block some DEI and detention abuses, and partially roll back the D.C. takeover (wk030-002, -013, -028, -061, -084, -126\u2013127), but an appeals court greenlights mass firings at the CFPB and foreign-aid cuts (wk030-087, -133), entrenching capture of key agencies (traits 13\u201316, 22). Simultaneously, Christian nationalist and personalist projects advance through Hegseth\u2019s attacks on women\u2019s and LGBTQ rights and religiously inflected military policy (wk030-017, -032, -051, -120\u2013121), while statistical and cultural institutions are politicized (wk030-045, -074, -075, -094).",

    "Federal power as a partisan weapon: D.C. federalization, sanctuary-city threats, and immigration raids show central authority selectively punishing Democratic or immigrant-heavy jurisdictions, eroding federalism and local self-rule.",
    "Normalization of militarized domestic governance: National Guard deployments, quick-reaction forces, and blurred military\u2013police lines in D.C. and Los Angeles embed security tools into routine political management.",
    "Institutional capture and hollowing-out: Politicized appointments and mass firings at BLS, CFPB, VA, and statistical agencies weaken neutral expertise and redirect agencies toward regime and donor interests.",
    "Christian nationalism and hierarchical citizenship: Hegseth\u2019s agenda against women\u2019s suffrage, LGBTQ and minority troops, and religiously framed messaging recasts equal citizenship as contingent on gender, faith, and ideology.",
    "Rule-of-law contests around immigration and protest: Harsh, often unlawful immigration enforcement triggers counter-litigation and oversight fights, making courts and local officials central battlegrounds over basic rights."
