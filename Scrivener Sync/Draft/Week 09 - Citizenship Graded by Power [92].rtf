In Week 9, the story of Trump\'92s second term turned more openly on who counts as part of the political community and who does not. The week\'92s events revealed a government that no longer hides its preference for some lives over others, or its impatience with limits on its will. Migrants, students, disabled people, and dissenting institutions all felt the weight of a state that now treats law as a tool to be aimed, not a boundary to be honored. At the same time, courts, state officials, and civil society tried to hold the line, but they did so against a rising tide of executive orders, agency purges, and public attacks on judges. The pattern was not a single dramatic break. It was a dense layering of actions that, taken together, narrowed the space in which democracy can breathe.\
\
At the start of Week 9, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:43 p.m. By the end, it had moved to 8:48 p.m., a shift of 5.4 minutes toward midnight. That movement reflects more than the volume of events; it marks a change in how power is used. The administration not only invoked an eighteenth\uc0\u8209 century wartime law to deport migrants, it continued flights after a federal judge ordered them halted, then called for that judge\'92s impeachment when he insisted on his authority. It did not only threaten universities with investigations; it clawed back hundreds of millions of dollars and tied the return of funds to demands that campuses suppress protest and reshape their curricula. It did not only criticize the press; it dismantled the government\'92s own international broadcasting system and barred a major wire service from the Oval Office. In each domain, the same lesson was taught: oversight can be ignored, opposition can be punished, and citizenship can be graded by origin, loyalty, and usefulness to those in power.\
\
The most direct expression of this new order came through the use of the Alien Enemies Act and related deportation tools. President Trump formally invoked the 1798 statute to expel alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, even though the United States is not at war with Venezuela. Under that banner, the administration deported more than 200 men to El Salvador, paying that government to confine them in a maximum\uc0\u8209 security prison. Tattoos and rumor often stood in for evidence. A Venezuelan makeup artist and LGBTQ+ asylum seeker was sent to a Salvadoran prison on the strength of religious crown tattoos that U.S. officials read as gang symbols. A Brown University medical professor was deported to Lebanon despite a judge\'92s order requiring 48 hours\'92 notice before removal. A sworn ICE declaration later admitted that many deportees had no criminal records at all. Law here did not function as a shield. It was the weapon itself.\
\
When federal judges tried to draw a line, the executive branch stepped over it. Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and, in a separate order, directed that planes already in the air be turned back. The administration let the flights land in El Salvador anyway, then argued that the judge\'92s authority ended once the planes left U.S. airspace and that his verbal instructions did not bind them because they were not yet written. Other courts halted deportations of specific individuals, such as Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and permanent resident, and Badar Khan Suri, an Indian academic at Georgetown, but those rulings came against a backdrop of mass removals already carried out. The message from the executive was blunt: court orders were treated as suggestions, to be parsed and evaded rather than obeyed.\
\
The confrontation did not stop at disobedience. President Trump publicly labeled Judge Boasberg a \'93radical left lunatic\'94 and called for his impeachment after the restraining order. A Republican congressman from Texas followed with formal articles of impeachment, turning a constitutional remedy for grave misconduct into a partisan response to an unwelcome ruling. The Department of Justice asked an appeals court to remove Boasberg from the case altogether, arguing that his orders exceeded his power. The White House press secretary misrepresented his decisions from the podium and attacked his wife\'92s political donations. Outside the courthouse, MAGA supporters issued bomb threats against judges, including a conservative Supreme Court justice who had ruled against administration positions. Chief Justice John Roberts issued an unusual public rebuke, reminding the country that impeachment is not a tool for policy disagreement. His words mattered, but they did not erase the fact that the executive had now normalized open hostility to judicial independence.\
\
While courts struggled to hold their ground, the administration moved quickly to reshape the civil service and the machinery of government itself. The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continued to act as the spearpoint of this effort. Its teams had already helped shutter USAID; this week, a federal judge ruled that dismantling the aid agency likely violated the Constitution and ordered parts of it restored. DOGE workers forced their way into the U.S. Institute of Peace building, despite the institution\'92s claim to independent status, and the administration removed the institute\'92s board in what its former CEO called an illegal takeover. DOGE operatives also arrived at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, sent staff home, swore in a new acting director, and canceled contracts and grants, following an executive order to eliminate the agency. These moves did not merely trim budgets. They stripped Congress\uc0\u8209 created institutions of their autonomy and repurposed their assets under direct executive control.\
\
At the same time, DOGE sought sweeping access to federal data systems. President Trump signed an order granting the office broad rights to unclassified agency records, software, and data, framed as a way to eliminate \'93information silos\'94 and root out waste. DOGE then turned to the Social Security Administration, attempting to mine its systems for evidence of fraud. Two federal judges, in separate cases, blocked DOGE from accessing Social Security data, calling its efforts a \'93fishing expedition\'94 and ordering the destruction of any personal information already obtained. Yet the underlying pattern remained. A politically led office, closely tied to a single billionaire adviser, was being positioned as a central node through which information about citizens and agencies would flow, with courts forced to intervene after the fact to protect privacy and legality.\
\
The broader civil service was being reshaped in parallel. President Trump fired both Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, leaving the agency without a quorum and likely violating statutory protections for independent commissioners. Legal analysts described the move as illegal, but the firings stood, and the commission\'92s ability to police corporate concentration and unfair practices was crippled. Thousands of IRS employees were dismissed under DOGE\'92s direction, with the administration falsely claiming they had been fired for poor performance despite internal warnings that this was untrue. The cuts produced chaos at the tax agency, closing taxpayer assistance offices and undermining enforcement. At the National Nuclear Security Administration, job cuts hollowed out teams of scientists and engineers responsible for managing the nuclear arsenal. At the USDA, inspection teams for plant and food imports were reduced, increasing risks from invasive pests and delaying shipments. In each case, the state\'92s capacity to perform basic, neutral functions was weakened, while the narrative of \'93efficiency\'94 and \'93fraud reduction\'94 provided cover.\
\
Education and civic infrastructure were particular targets. Over the course of the week, President Trump signed a series of executive orders directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department of Education, a department created by Congress. One order, titled \'93Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities,\'94 instructed the secretary to take steps to close the department and return authority to states and localities. Other orders and public statements made clear that the administration intended to cut programs for students with disabilities and English learners, end Pell Grants and federal aid for low\uc0\u8209 income students, and move the federal student loan portfolio to the Small Business Administration. The department also removed online applications for income\u8209 driven repayment plans from its website, and the American Federation of Teachers sued, arguing that the shutdown of these options violated federal law. Teachers\'92 unions and Democratic officials vowed to challenge the dismantling of the department in court, but the executive orders had already set in motion a structural reordering of how education is funded and governed.\
\
Universities found themselves under direct financial and political pressure. The administration withdrew $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, citing alleged failures to curb antisemitism, and then sent a letter demanding a mask ban, the winding down of certain academic departments, and expanded powers for campus police as conditions for restoring the money. It froze $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women\'92s sports, calling those policies demeaning and dangerous. A new task force was announced to investigate alleged antisemitism at ten major universities, and sixty schools received warning letters about possible discrimination investigations. At the same time, immigration authorities arrested or targeted pro\uc0\u8209 Palestinian students and scholars: Mahmoud Khalil was detained and threatened with deportation; Badar Khan Suri\'92s visa was revoked and he was held until a judge intervened; a Cornell PhD student who sued over deportation orders was asked to surrender to ICE days after filing his case. The combined effect was to turn federal funding, immigration status, and law enforcement into levers for disciplining campuses that tolerated dissenting views.\
\
The administration\'92s approach to information and memory followed the same logic. Early in the week, President Trump signed an order eliminating the U.S. Agency for Global Media, parent of Voice of America, and placed more than 1,000 VOA journalists on administrative leave. Contracts with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia were canceled, and funding for those outlets was terminated. Lawmakers and commentators warned that the move gutted an 83\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old system of independent journalism that had reached hundreds of millions of listeners and served as a pro\u8209 democracy voice abroad. At home, the White House restricted Associated Press access to the Oval Office and Air Force One after the AP refused to adopt the term \'93Gulf of America\'94 in place of \'93Gulf of Mexico.\'94 A federal judge declined to immediately restore AP\'92s access, leaving the restriction in place. Together, these steps starved independent and semi\u8209 independent media of resources and access, while leaving state\u8209 aligned messaging less challenged.\
\
Within the military and justice systems, history and guidance were quietly rewritten. The Department of Defense removed at least ten articles about Navajo Code Talkers, Black veterans, and women who served in the armed forces from official websites, replacing their URLs with \'93DEI\'94 labels. Training courses featuring the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots were dropped to comply with an executive order eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. After public outcry, a webpage honoring a Black Medal of Honor recipient was restored, but the broader campaign against DEI continued. At the Department of Justice, eleven guidance documents on Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, including materials on Covid\uc0\u8209 19, masking, and accessibility, were removed as \'93unnecessary and outdated.\'94 These deletions did not change statutes, but they altered what information was readily available to businesses, educators, and the public, and they signaled which histories and rights the state now considered expendable.\
\
Immigration enforcement became a stage on which these new norms were displayed. ICE intensified raids on Chinese immigrants, including in sanctuary cities, and charter flights to China increased. A German green\uc0\u8209 card holder was detained at Boston\'92s Logan Airport, stripped naked, and interrogated until he was pressured to give up his residency. A Canadian woman with a valid work visa was held for two weeks in harsh conditions without clear explanation. A mixed\u8209 status family with a ten\u8209 year\u8209 old girl recovering from brain surgery filed a complaint alleging that Customs and Border Protection denied urgent medical care and subjected them to abuse. A French scientist was denied entry after border officers searched his phone and found messages critical of the Trump administration. Jeanette Vizguerra, a long\u8209 time immigration advocate, was arrested outside a store in Denver. In each case, the power to admit, detain, or deport was used not only to enforce rules, but to send a message about who belongs and who may safely speak.\
\
The border itself was being militarized in new ways. Reports described a plan to establish a militarized buffer zone along the southern border in New Mexico, staffed by active\uc0\u8209 duty troops with authority to detain people crossing unlawfully. The zone would function as a kind of domestic military installation, allowing soldiers to hold migrants until they could be handed over to immigration officers. Legal analysts warned that this approach risked circumventing the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement. At the same time, the administration refused, for the first time, a Mexican request for water under a 1944 treaty, citing Mexico\'92s own shortfalls and the needs of American agriculture. It imposed new rules requiring Canadians to pass through formal border crossings to access a shared cross\u8209 border library that had long symbolized cooperation. These decisions showed federal power being used punitively against neighboring countries and border communities, rather than as a neutral administrator of shared resources.\
\
The week also saw the deepening of a particular relationship between the state and a small circle of private actors, most notably Elon Musk. Starlink internet service was installed across the White House campus as a \'93donation,\'94 carried out by a Musk employee who also worked for DOGE. The installation was not properly coordinated with the Secret Service, triggered a security alert, and raised questions about procurement rules and conflicts of interest. The Federal Aviation Administration canceled a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and instead paid Starlink to manage U.S. airspace, prompting Democratic senators to call for investigations into possible corruption. Musk was scheduled to receive a Pentagon briefing on U.S. war plans for a potential conflict with China, a plan later walked back after press reports, and he visited the Pentagon for a private briefing on national security matters. When those plans leaked, he threatened legal action and called for the prosecution of Pentagon insiders. President Trump later acknowledged that Musk\'92s business ties to China made it inappropriate to share war plans with him, but the fact that such a briefing had been contemplated at all underscored how far private influence had penetrated the national security sphere.\
\
Against this backdrop, foreign policy shifted in ways that favored authoritarian partners and weakened democratic alliances. The Pentagon froze intelligence and weapons packages to Ukraine, causing anxiety among Ukrainian forces and allies. The administration withdrew from an international body investigating responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine and terminated a contract with a university team that had been tracking Russian abductions of Ukrainian children for European law enforcement. President Trump held calls with Vladimir Putin about a possible ceasefire, during which Putin reportedly mocked him and demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Ukraine. At the same time, the administration considered relinquishing the U.S. role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe within NATO, a move that would reduce American influence in the alliance. Big technology companies, including Musk\'92s X, asked the administration to challenge Australian media laws they described as coercive, aligning U.S. trade pressure with corporate interests abroad. These choices signaled a reorientation of American power away from support for democratic partners and toward accommodation of strongmen and corporate demands.\
\
In the domestic information sphere, the administration\'92s treatment of dissenters and whistleblowers reinforced the same pattern. An FBI agent and whistleblower, Johnathan Buma, was arrested at JFK Airport and charged with illegally disclosing classified information after he had accused the bureau of political bias. The administration and Musk both called for the prosecution of those who leaked details of Musk\'92s planned Pentagon briefing. The White House press secretary attacked Judge Boasberg and his family. Steve Bannon dismissed the possibility that innocent people had been swept up in mass deportations, calling it a \'93tough break.\'94 Protesters who damaged Tesla property with Molotov cocktails were charged with crimes described as domestic terrorism, and President Trump suggested that such offenders should serve 20\uc0\u8209 year sentences in El Salvador. In each case, the line between legitimate protest, whistleblowing, and criminality was redrawn to favor those aligned with the regime and to stigmatize those who challenged it.\
\
Yet resistance persisted. Federal judges blocked the administration from clawing back $20 billion in climate grants and halted a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, calling the policy \'93soaked in animus.\'94 They ruled that the shutdown of USAID likely violated the Constitution and ordered the agency partially restored. They barred DOGE from accessing Social Security data and ordered any improperly collected personal information destroyed. They prevented the deportation of specific academics and activists whose cases appeared to rest on their political views. Democratic attorneys general filed roughly ten lawsuits against Trump administration policies, securing temporary restraining orders in nearly all of them and organizing community impact hearings across the country to gather testimony from those harmed by job cuts, deportations, and funding freezes. Civil society groups planned nationwide protests at Tesla dealerships and launched campaigns to hold figures like Andrew Tate accountable. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s movement, but they showed that institutional and civic tools for resistance remained available and were being used.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 9, several processes were already in motion that would shape the coming weeks. Courts had set deadlines for the administration to explain its defiance of deportation orders and its attempts to access Social Security data. Lawsuits over the dismantling of the Department of Education, the shutdown of USAID, and the halting of income\uc0\u8209 driven student loan plans were underway. Investigations into the FAA\'92s contract decisions and Musk\'92s influence on federal procurement had been requested. State legislatures were advancing bills to reclassify mifepristone as a controlled substance, and the Trump administration had asked for time to reconsider its position in key abortion\u8209 pill lawsuits. The Federal Election Commission had scheduled meetings and an audit hearing that would test its ability to function amid broader institutional strain. These were not speculative risks. They were concrete proceedings that would determine whether the week\'92s breaches would be entrenched or partially repaired.\
\
By the close of Week 9, with the Democracy Clock at 8:48 p.m., the civic covenant described in the moral assessment of the week had clearly cracked. Executive power operated with less effective oversight than before, emergency authorities were treated as a standing toolkit rather than an exception, and security forces increasingly served the preservation of elite interests over the protection of vulnerable people. Law was used as a weapon against migrants, students, and dissenting institutions, while courts that tried to enforce limits were attacked as partisan and threatened with impeachment. Independent media and civic education were hollowed out, replaced by curated narratives and market\uc0\u8209 driven structures that favored those already in power. Citizenship itself became more stratified, with legal status, origin, and ideology determining who could count on the protection of the state.\
\
This week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly a democracy can move from contested norms to open defiance of its own guardrails. The administration did not simply test boundaries; it crossed them, then sought to punish those who objected. At the same time, judges, state officials, and civil society actors demonstrated that resistance is still possible, though it now requires more courage and carries greater risk. The shift of 5.4 minutes on the Democracy Clock captures that tension. It records not only the damage done, but the narrowing margin within which repair can still occur. The official end\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 period time is 8:48 p.m. The hour is not yet late enough that outcomes are fixed, but it is late enough that every further breach of character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship will be harder to undo.\
\
## Week 9 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Donald Trump used a Justice Department speech to air personal grievances about his criminal cases (2025-03-15): The president turned a law-enforcement policy address into a personal victory speech over his own prosecutions, blurring the line between neutral justice administration and the leader\'92s private political narrative.\
\
2. President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize arrests and deportations of noncitizens without normal due process (2025-03-15): By using an 18th\uc0\u8209 century wartime statute in peacetime to detain and expel migrants, the president expanded discretionary power over noncitizens and weakened ordinary legal safeguards.\
\
3. Trump administration deported hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador despite a federal court order halting flights (2025-03-16): Continuing mass deportation flights after a judge\'92s restraining order showed the executive branch asserting power above judicial control, undermining checks and balances and due process for migrants.\
\
4. President Donald Trump declared that President Biden\'92s pardons were void because they were signed by autopen (2025-03-16): Claiming authority to nullify a predecessor\'92s pardons challenged the stability of constitutional clemency powers and suggested that legal protections can be retroactively withdrawn by a new executive.\
\
5. President Donald Trump targeted Democratic\uc0\u8209 aligned law firms with executive orders and public attacks (2025-03-17): Using executive power to single out law firms representing political opponents signaled willingness to punish legal adversaries, pressuring independent representation in politically sensitive cases.\
\
6. President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg after rulings limiting deportations (2025-03-18): Demanding impeachment of a judge over adverse immigration rulings threatened judicial independence and signaled that courts risk retaliation for enforcing legal limits on executive power.\
\
7. President Donald Trump ordered US airstrikes in Yemen without congressional authorization (2025-03-16): Launching lethal strikes abroad without explicit legislative approval expanded unilateral war\uc0\u8209 making authority, weakening Congress\'92s role in decisions over the use of force.\
\
8. President Donald Trump signed an order dismantling the US Agency for Global Media and its broadcasters (2025-03-15): Eliminating the agency overseeing Voice of America and related outlets concentrated control over state\uc0\u8209 funded international broadcasting in the executive, shrinking semi\u8209 independent platforms for public information.\
\
9. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education (2025-03-20): Ordering the shutdown of a congressionally created department by executive fiat challenged legislative authority and threatened federal guarantees for equal educational access and civil rights enforcement.\
\
10. President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Education\'92s student loan portfolio moved to the Small Business Administration (2025-03-21): Transferring federal student loan management to an agency with little experience in education finance risked service disruption for millions of borrowers and weakened specialized oversight structures.\
\
11. President Donald Trump revoked Temporary Protected Status and parole\uc0\u8209 based legal status for about 530,000 immigrants (2025-03-21): Ending legal protections for over half a million residents from crisis\u8209 hit countries abruptly exposed them to deportation, using executive discretion to reorder the lives of a large, politically weak population.\
\
12. President Donald Trump revoked Secret Service protection and security clearances from prominent political opponents and former officials (2025-03-17): Stripping security protections and clearances from rivals like Biden, Harris, and others used state security tools as political leverage, potentially chilling opposition activity and post\uc0\u8209 office public service.\
\
13. President Donald Trump signed an order granting the Department of Government Efficiency broad access to federal agency records and systems (2025-03-19): Expanding a politically aligned efficiency office\'92s access to unclassified data and software systems increased centralized executive control over the bureaucracy and raised risks of politicized data use.\
\
14. President Donald Trump issued an order shifting national preparedness responsibilities toward state and local governments (2025-03-19): Reframing resilience and continuity planning around state and local control altered how federal power would be used in crises, potentially fragmenting national standards and accountability.\
\
15. President Donald Trump issued multiple executive orders to consolidate procurement, expand mineral production, and eliminate information silos (2025-03-20): New directives centralizing procurement, speeding mining permits, and mandating broad data sharing strengthened executive control over economic and information levers with limited external oversight.\
\
16. President Donald Trump publicly supported extremely harsh foreign prison sentences for people who vandalize Tesla property (2025-03-20): Endorsing 20\uc0\u8209 year terms in El Salvador for property damage tied punishment to a foreign carceral regime and signaled a willingness to use disproportionate penalties to protect favored corporate allies.\
\
17. President Donald Trump admitted that Elon Musk\'92s China business ties made him an unsuitable recipient of war plans (2025-03-21): Acknowledging that a senior adviser\'92s foreign business interests conflicted with access to war planning highlighted how private economic entanglements can compromise national security decision\uc0\u8209 making.\
\
18. President Donald Trump revoked a prior punitive order against law firm Paul Weiss after it agreed to policy changes (2025-03-21): Lifting sanctions on a major firm in exchange for internal policy shifts showed how executive pressure can reshape private legal institutions\'92 practices, blurring lines between state power and professional autonomy.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump enacted a Republican stopgap funding bill to keep the federal government operating through September (2025-03-15): Passing and signing a partisan funding bill averted a shutdown but locked in cuts to nondefense programs and IRS resources, shaping the capacity of federal institutions for the rest of the fiscal year.\
\
2. Congressman Brandon Gill filed articles of impeachment against Judge James Boasberg over his deportation rulings (2025-03-19): Introducing impeachment articles against a sitting federal judge for a specific decision threatened to turn constitutional oversight of the judiciary into a partisan weapon.\
\
3. Chief Justice John Roberts publicly rebuked calls to impeach Judge Boasberg for his immigration decisions (2025-03-18): The Chief Justice\'92s statement defending impeachment\'92s limited role reinforced norms of judicial independence and clarified that disagreement with rulings is not grounds for removal.\
\
4. Demand Justice warned that Trump could appoint over 300 federal judges in coming years (2025-03-18): Forecasting hundreds of potential new Trump judicial appointments highlighted how sustained control over nominations could entrench a long\uc0\u8209 term ideological tilt in the federal courts.\
\
5. President Donald Trump fired both Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, leaving it without a quorum (2025-03-18): Removing opposition commissioners from an independent agency likely illegally undermined its ability to enforce antitrust and consumer protection laws, politicizing regulatory oversight.\
\
6. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled that dismantling USAID by DOGE likely violated the Constitution and ordered restoration steps (2025-03-18): Finding that executive efforts to shutter USAID infringed Congress\'92s authority reaffirmed that presidents cannot unilaterally abolish agencies created by statute.\
\
7. Federal courts issued multiple rulings blocking Trump administration initiatives, including DEI rollbacks, climate grant clawbacks, USAID cuts, and a military transgender ban (2025-03-18): A series of injunctions against executive orders on diversity, climate funding, foreign aid, and military service showed courts actively checking overreach and protecting statutory and constitutional norms.\
\
8. Federal judges including James Boasberg issued and enforced temporary restraining orders limiting use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations (2025-03-17): By ruling that the Alien Enemies Act applies only to enemy nations and halting related deportations, courts asserted that even broad statutory powers must be interpreted within constitutional bounds.\
\
9. U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander and other federal judges blocked DOGE from accessing Social Security data and ordered deletion of improperly obtained records (2025-03-21): Labeling DOGE\'92s mass data access a \'93fishing expedition\'94 and forcing destruction of personal data reinforced judicial oversight of executive data\uc0\u8209 mining and privacy protections.\
\
10. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg demanded detailed explanations from the government for apparent noncompliance with deportation orders (2025-03-21): Requiring the administration to account for deportation flights that ignored his injunction underscored the judiciary\'92s role in enforcing its own orders against an evasive executive.\
\
11. Democratic state attorneys general filed and enforced numerous lawsuits securing restraining orders against Trump administration directives (2025-03-21): Coordinated multistate litigation that paused firings, funding freezes, and grant \'93pauses\'94 showed subnational officials using courts to defend programs and rights against federal policy shifts.\
\
12. American Federation of Teachers sued the Department of Education over halted income\uc0\u8209 driven student loan repayment processing (2025-03-19): Challenging the shutdown of income\u8209 based repayment options sought to force the department to follow statutory mandates and protect borrowers from sudden policy reversals.\
\
13. Federal Election Commission scheduled closed and open Sunshine Act meetings and an audit hearing on campaign compliance (2025-03-18): Planned FEC meetings on enforcement matters, advisory opinions, and audits reflected ongoing institutional routines for overseeing campaign finance and party activities.\
\
14. Federal communications and safety regulators issued and revised multiple rules and information collections on alerts, spectrum, devices, and safety standards (2025-03-18): Routine FCC, TSA, OSHA, FDA, DEA, and EPA rulemakings and data collections showed administrative agencies continuing technical governance functions despite broader political turmoil.\
\
15. Department of Government Efficiency team moved to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services by sending staff home and canceling grants (2025-03-21): Acting on an executive order to abolish a cultural agency, DOGE\'92s intervention disrupted grant programs and raised questions about executive authority to dismantle congressionally created institutions.\
\
16. Federal courts and pipeline company Energy Transfer secured a $660 million defamation verdict against Greenpeace over Dakota Access pipeline protests (2025-03-19): The massive damages award in a protest\uc0\u8209 related defamation case risked chilling advocacy groups\'92 criticism of powerful companies and suggested courts may favor corporate plaintiffs in such disputes.\
\
17. Federal courts granted the Trump administration a 60\uc0\u8209 day extension in mifepristone lawsuits to reassess its position (2025-03-18): Allowing extra time for the new administration to reconsider its stance on abortion pill litigation opened space for potential policy reversals affecting reproductive health access.\
\
18. Federal courts barred the deportation of academics Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri while their cases proceed (2025-03-20): Judicial orders protecting two pro\uc0\u8209 Palestinian scholars from removal underscored courts\'92 role in shielding political speech and academic freedom from executive immigration actions.\
\
19. Federal courts and DOJ clashed over DOJ attempts to remove Judge Boasberg from the deportation case (2025-03-19): The Justice Department\'92s bid to disqualify a judge who had restricted deportations, and his rejection of their jurisdictional arguments, highlighted institutional friction over who interprets the reach of court orders.\
\
20. Federal Election Commission continued audit and advisory processes despite potential funding uncertainties (2025-03-18): By planning audits and advisory opinions contingent on government funding, the FEC showed how budget politics can indirectly threaten election oversight capacity.\
\
\
### Economic Structure\
\
1. Environmental Protection Agency under Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to roll back or eliminate 31 major pollution regulations and gut its research office (2025-03-15): Scaling back air, water, and climate rules and planning to fire over 1,000 scientists shifted regulatory policy toward industry interests at the expense of public health and evidence\uc0\u8209 based governance.\
\
2.
