\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 24 Appendix: Law as Detention Infrastructure\
\
This week marks a major structural lurch toward authoritarian governance, anchored by passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill and a cluster of Supreme Court decisions expanding executive impunity and constraining judicial checks. The bill simultaneously entrenches plutocratic tax policy, slashes the social safety net, and massively expands immigration enforcement and detention capacity, hardwiring inequality (trait 36) and stratified citizenship (47) into statute. Senate Republicans\'92 open defiance of the parliamentarian and budget rules, combined with the Court\'92s limits on nationwide injunctions and prior presidential immunity ruling, sharply weaken law as a constraint (4) and legislative oversight (15). Aggressive, often lawless immigration enforcement\'97new mega-jails, inhumane conditions, denaturalization priorities, and attempts to defy court orders\'97further align security forces with regime preservation over rights (9, 47). Parallel attacks on press and universities, data suppression, and politicized appointments deepen information control and institutional capture (16, 22, 42\'9644, 60). A few judicial pushbacks on asylum, TPS, and HHS firings show residual resistance, but the net pressure is overwhelmingly toward concentrated, unaccountable executive power operating through punitive welfare retrenchment and carceral expansion.\
