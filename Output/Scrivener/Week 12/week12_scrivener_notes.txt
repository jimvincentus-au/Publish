Metadata for Week 12
====================

Title
-----
Emergency Powers as Routine Governance

Subtitle
--------
Tariffs, deportations, and funding threats fused into a single method of rule, tightening executive control while leaving formal institutions visibly intact.

Tagline / Hook
-------------
No single rupture defined the week; instead, emergency tools, legal threats, and information control quietly reset what counts as normal democratic governance.

Synopses
--------
Long Synopsis:
Week 12 of Trump’s second term registered as a near‑static moment on the Democracy Clock, but the machinery behind the dial shifted. The presidency leaned on emergency economic powers to launch and then partially pause a global tariff war, jolting markets and inviting foreign retaliation while Congress struggled to reclaim authority. Immigration enforcement hardened into a data‑driven deportation regime: TPS holders, students, lawful residents, and even citizens were swept into an apparatus powered by IRS records, Palantir‑linked databases, and social‑media surveillance. Universities, law firms, nonprofits, and cultural institutions faced funding freezes, consent decrees, and targeted investigations that tied their survival to political compliance. Courts alternated between deference and resistance, greenlighting mass firings and Alien Enemies Act deportations even as they ordered the return of a wrongfully removed resident and restored press access. Voting rules tightened under the banner of integrity, public history and science were scrubbed, and the civil service was hollowed out or privatized. The net effect was consolidation without spectacle: emergency as normal governance.

Short Synopsis:
The clock barely moved, but power did. Emergency tariffs, mass‑deportation machinery, coerced universities, and curated public memory deepened a presidency governing by decree while institutions fought rearguard actions.

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock remained at 7:56 p.m., shifting only 0.4 minutes deeper into danger (from 476.1 to 476.5 minutes). This slight numerical change masks a broad consolidation of executive power, signaling incremental but cumulative erosion rather than a dramatic break.
- image_prompts: {"square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a small American flag, a judge’s gavel, a stack of redacted documents, a student protest sign half‑folded, and a brass clock stopped at 7:56. In the background, a blurred military medal and a closed file stamped \"Emergency\" suggest power and secrecy. Painterly, realistic lighting with strong contrasts.", "wide": "A dusk cityscape of Washington, DC, seen from above, with the Capitol and Supreme Court buildings in partial shadow while the White House glows unnaturally bright. Subtle overlays of data streams and barbed wire trace across the sky, and a large, faint clock face is superimposed behind the monuments, its hands barely moved. The mood is tense and painterly, with realistic detail and muted colors."}
