Week 50: Emergencies as Everyday Governance
A holiday week of serial emergencies, militarized immigration, and curated memory quietly widened executive power while courts, agencies, and citizens mounted partial resistance.
The fiftieth week of Trump’s second term unfolded in the space between spectacle and structure. On the surface, it was a holiday interval, marked by Christmas messages, year‑end vetoes, and New Year’s threats. Beneath that surface, the week stitched together moves that tightened the grip of the executive over force, law, and narrative, while leaving just enough institutional resistance to suggest that the old order still lived. The pattern was not of a sudden break, but of a regime that had learned how to use the tools already in its hands more confidently and more broadly. One step at a time, it widened its reach.
At the close of the prior period, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:11 p.m. It ended this week at the same public time, with a small inward movement of 0.2 minutes. The face of the clock did not change, but its mechanism did. The shift captured a dense cluster of actions that expanded unilateral executive power, hardened a militarized immigration regime, and further fused public authority with private and partisan interests. Courts and civil society registered as counterweights in several domains, yet their interventions were defensive and partial. The net effect was to deepen the strain on democratic safeguards without triggering a visible rupture. The danger grew quieter, not smaller.
The clearest expression of that strain came in the New Year’s cluster of executive actions. On December 31, Trump declared nine national emergencies, using them to bypass Congress on tariffs and other key policies. Emergency, once an exception, became a standing method of rule. The same week, the White House asserted direct control over immigration, criminal law, and forcible renditions, centralizing coercive authority in the president’s immediate circle. These moves did not abolish existing statutes or agencies. They reinterpreted them so that decisions about who could be seized, deported, or targeted flowed upward to the center. Power moved from rules to will.
Abroad, the use of force followed the same pattern of unilateralism and opacity. Trump announced U.S. military strikes on Islamic State‑linked militants in Nigeria and Syria, framing them as part of a broader campaign with little visible congressional debate. A separate claim of a lethal strike on a drug facility in Venezuela, made without independent verification, blurred the line between propaganda and policy. In the eastern Pacific, a lethal strike on a small boat, reportedly part of a campaign that had already killed more than a hundred people, extended the logic of the drug war into quasi‑military operations at sea. Each action was presented as a discrete security response. Together, they normalized a presidency that wages war without clear authorization.
The rhetoric followed the force. Trump’s “locked and loaded” threat toward Iran over protest repression showed how a few words from the president could move the country closer to conflict without formal deliberation. Threats of future, stronger National Guard deployments to U.S. cities if crime rose, delivered after courts forced withdrawals, carried the same message at home: the executive reserved the right to escalate. The call to eliminate the Senate filibuster, made days earlier, fit into this pattern. It was framed as a way to break gridlock. In practice, it would remove one of the last procedural brakes on a president aligned with a compliant majority. The checks would be fewer, and weaker.
Yet the week also recorded points where other branches pushed back. The Supreme Court blocked National Guard deployment in Illinois and preliminarily rejected Trump’s justification, a rare direct rebuke of a sitting president’s use of troops for domestic policing. The Justice Department stopped contesting a ruling that returned control of the California National Guard to the governor, accepting judicial limits on federalization. A federal judge ordered the administration to continue funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, blocking an attempted executive defunding of a congressionally created watchdog. These decisions did not reverse the broader trend toward emergency governance, but they showed that some legal boundaries still held. The line bent, but did not yet break.
If the first development traced the widening of executive force, the second mapped how that force settled into the immigration system. The Department of Justice ordered prioritization and expansion of denaturalization cases, making citizenship more revocable and less secure. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services paused immigration proceedings for nationals of nineteen travel‑ban countries, canceling ceremonies and interviews for vetted applicants under a blanket security pretext. The administration terminated legal protections for Somalis in Minnesota, pairing the move with public rhetoric linking the community to fraud. These policy levers turned immigration status into a tool of selective vulnerability. Some passports counted less than others.
Capacity followed policy. ICE increased its spending on weaponry by 600 percent, including chemical agents, signaling a shift toward militarized enforcement. The agency launched a $100 million media campaign to recruit thousands of new agents, offering bonuses and student loan relief in a wartime tone. Plans for warehouse‑style detention centers near logistics hubs emphasized throughput and scale over individualized hearings. The deportation of Oregon vineyard manager Moises Sotelo, the dragging of immigrants from cars and courthouse hallways, and expanded FBI operations in Minnesota with referrals for denaturalization and deportation gave these structural changes a human face. Communities experienced them as sudden ruptures in daily life. Fear became part of the landscape.
The messaging matched the machinery. ICE shared an AI‑generated Christmas video depicting Santa deporting an immigrant, turning removal into a festive joke and dehumanizing its targets. Senator Tommy Tuberville’s call for mass deportation of Muslim Americans, and his joint narrative with ICE celebrating deportations, reinforced the idea that certain faiths and origins were incompatible with belonging. Militarized DHS agents with assault rifles appeared in major cities, blurring the line between policing and occupation. Immigration enforcement, public relations, and domestic security converged into a single carceral project. The border moved inward, into streets and screens.
Courts again provided limited relief at the margins. A federal judge ordered the administration to return or hold hearings for people deported to El Salvador’s CECOT mega‑prison, affirming that even extreme immigration measures were subject to judicial review. Another court issued a temporary restraining order preventing detention of anti‑disinformation advocate Imran Ahmed while he sued the government, checking a potentially retaliatory use of border power. Charges against a TikTok streamer shot by immigration agents were dismissed with prejudice after constitutional violations and obstructed access to counsel came to light. At the same time, the administration facilitated the return of a media figure previously expelled for running Russian propaganda, underscoring the strategic, rather than purely security‑driven, nature of its border choices. The rules bent toward friends and against critics.
Overlaying these enforcement moves was a more explicit religious frame. During Christmas communications, DHS, the State Department, and Trump coordinated Christian‑centric messaging, casting the Nigeria strikes as acts of defending Christians. The language of persecution and protection turned foreign policy into a stage for Christian nationalism. Tuberville’s call for mass deportation of Muslim Americans, delivered from within the Senate, translated that narrative into domestic terms. ICE’s Santa deportation video, and the broader portrayal of Muslims and immigrants as threats, made the religious divide vivid. Faith became a marker of risk.
On the ground, the security state continued to confront real threats. The FBI arrested an eighteen‑year‑old in North Carolina for planning an ISIS‑inspired New Year’s Eve attack on religious and LGBTQ+ targets, a case that showed the ongoing need for counter‑terrorism work. But the same week saw the end of protections for Somalis in Minnesota and the criminalization of a self‑managed abortion in Kentucky through a fetal‑homicide charge, despite state law not criminalizing such acts. The juxtaposition suggested that genuine security concerns were being folded into a broader project of sorting citizens by faith, origin, and compliance. Protection and persecution moved side by side.
Economic governance, meanwhile, moved further into the hands of private actors and donors. The Department of Government Efficiency, created under Elon Musk, operated as a quasi‑private super‑department with sweeping authority to cut federal programs and reshape budgets. Its mandate fell heavily on health, science, and anti‑hunger programs. Large cuts to NIH and vaccine research weakened the public infrastructure for medical innovation. Social Security backlogs swelled to more than six million cases amid staffing reductions, delaying benefits for millions and eroding a core social insurance institution. Anti‑hunger and transit programs saw similar pressure. The safety net frayed where it was most needed.
At the same time, explicit episodes of cronyism surfaced. A $20 billion bailout for Argentina was structured in ways that benefited a hedge fund billionaire friend of the Treasury secretary, raising questions about whose interests guided international financial decisions. A $5 million donation to a Trump‑aligned Super PAC preceded a Medicare decision to delay a rule that would have cut a donor’s revenues from overpriced products. The timing suggested that regulatory outcomes could be bought, not just influenced. The termination of the National Links Trust lease for Washington, D.C.’s public golf courses, without a clear successor plan, fueled fears that public land could be steered toward private profit aligned with the president. Governance and gain blurred into one.
Public goods and climate policy were not spared. Federal funding cuts to public transit systems undermined low‑carbon mobility and burdened riders, trading long‑term climate and equity goals for short‑term savings or ideological gain. Enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired after a forty‑three‑day shutdown, doubling premiums for many enrollees and using budget brinkmanship to shift costs onto households. Trade policy swung with presidential decisions and industry lobbying: tariffs on Chinese goods were adjusted by executive order; threatened hikes on furniture and cabinets were delayed; near‑100 percent tariffs on Italian pasta were scaled back after pressure; and exemptions softened earlier measures. The pattern was not of a coherent strategy, but of a system where organized capital could secure relief while others bore the costs. Rules became negotiable for the well‑connected.
Legislatures and courts became contested arenas where these trends were both advanced and resisted. In the U.S. House, members censured Representative Al Green for interrupting Trump during a joint session, using a rare disciplinary tool to police internal dissent rather than debate presidential legitimacy. In Tennessee, the state House expelled Representatives Justin Pearson and Justin Jones for leading a gun‑violence protest on the floor, removing elected voices rather than engaging their demands. These actions signaled that formal rules of decorum and discipline could be turned into instruments of loyalty enforcement. Dissent inside the chamber carried a price.
In North Carolina, the General Assembly restructured the state Board of Elections to favor Republican control, undermining the neutrality of election administration. Yet earlier in the year, courts and the state board had restored wrongly discarded ballots and certified Allison Riggs as the rightful winner of a Supreme Court race, correcting a serious disenfranchisement. The same duality appeared in the courts’ handling of rights. An appeals court allowed the administration to strip Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood in twenty‑two states and the District of Columbia, aligning access to care with ideological priorities. Kentucky authorities charged Melinda Spencer with fetal homicide after a self‑managed abortion, effectively criminalizing reproductive outcomes despite statutory language. The law’s edge cut in one direction.
Against this, other rulings preserved key protections. The injunction keeping CFPB funding intact, the order requiring hearings or return for CECOT deportees, and the decisions protecting Imran Ahmed and the TikTok streamer all showed judges enforcing due process and statutory limits. Congress, for its part, passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bipartisan law compelling the Justice Department to release records related to Jeffrey Epstein, and the House Judiciary Committee took and released sworn testimony from former Special Counsel Jack Smith, creating a detailed record of evidence‑based prosecutions of Trump. These moves did not stop executive overreach, but they documented it and kept some channels of accountability open. The record, at least, was not entirely erased.
The promise of transparency in the Epstein case quickly met the reality of institutional obstruction. Civil‑society groups pressed Congress and DOJ to ensure full release of the files. DOJ responded by launching a massive review of more than five million pages, a process that consumed resources and time while missing statutory deadlines. Releases were slow and heavily managed. Later, the department acknowledged that millions more Epstein‑related documents remained undisclosed, despite the law’s mandate. The effect was to keep the most sensitive material sealed behind procedural justifications. The archive stayed in the dark.
The stakes of that secrecy were underscored by reports that Epstein had gained access to young spa workers through Mar‑a‑Lago, raising questions about institutional complicity in exploitation tied to elite networks. At the same time, the media environment showed its own forms of curation. CBS and 60 Minutes pulled an investigative report on CECOT from broadcast and archives, limiting mainstream exposure to potential wrongdoing, even as bootleg copies spread online. More broadly, critical reporting was censored or sidelined while regime‑friendly narratives were amplified. The result was a public record in which some scandals were exhaustively documented and others remained in the shadows. Memory itself became contested ground.
Information control extended beyond archives and broadcasts into the realm of digital propaganda and border power. ICE’s AI Santa deportation video and DOGE’s attempted access to sensitive federal employee databases illustrated how algorithmic tools could be used for psychological operations and potential targeting, rather than neutral administration. DHS’s unauthorized use of Japanese artist Hiroshi Nagai’s artwork in a tranquil post‑deportation America campaign co‑opted culture for state messaging and misrepresented the artist’s views. Visa bans on European anti‑disinformation figures, justified by labeling their work as censorship, sought to delegitimize and deter oversight of online harms. The tools of travel and code became tools of control.
Trump’s own communications added to the fog. The White House shared misleading images claiming that wind turbines had killed a bald eagle, using miscaptioned foreign photos to spread disinformation about renewable energy. These posts sat alongside the Venezuela strike claim and other unverified assertions, making it harder for citizens to distinguish between official fact and political fiction. At the same time, the administration facilitated the return of a known Russian propagandist while cracking down on other immigrants, suggesting that border controls could be aligned with information operations as much as with security. The border became a filter for stories as well as people.
Civil society and parts of the private sector pushed back where they could. Investigative reporting exposed corporate sponsorship of a white supremacist podcast, prompting Rocket Money to withdraw its ads and demonstrating that public scrutiny could still change behavior. Public school advocates mobilized in response to a political attack on the Chapel Hill School District by North Carolina’s Select Committee on Oversight and Reform, seeing it as part of a broader campaign to reshape civic education. These episodes showed that the information war was not one‑sided, even as the state’s tools grew more sophisticated. Resistance still found ways to speak.
Federal power was also wielded unevenly across regions and communities. Trump vetoed a unanimously passed Colorado clean‑water bill that would have funded drinking water projects, reportedly in retaliation for unrelated political disputes. He similarly vetoed an Everglades protection bill affecting Miccosukee tribal lands after a conflict over a detention center, blocking funds that would have protected Indigenous territory. In Minnesota, the end of Somali protections and the public linking of the community to fraud, backed by expanded FBI operations, signaled that entire communities could be cast under suspicion and stripped of legal security. Geography and identity shaped exposure to risk.
Budget and service decisions fell along similar lines. Transit funding cuts hit urban systems critical for working‑class mobility and climate goals. The expiration of ACA subsidies after the shutdown raised premiums for many, with disproportionate impact on lower‑income households. Social Security backlogs and earlier plans to limit phone service, later reversed after outcry, made access to benefits harder for the elderly and disabled. In North Carolina, tax‑cut plans for wealthy individuals and corporations delayed the state budget and threatened funding for childcare and health services. Grassroots responses, such as the planned Long March against racial gerrymandering and Black voter disenfranchisement, showed that targeted communities were not passive, but the imbalance of power was clear. The center held the purse; the margins bore the strain.
Amid these pressures, civil society mobilized in visible and less visible ways. Organizers planned a nationwide Free America Walk Out for January 20, aiming to demonstrate mass noncooperation with what they saw as coercive state practices. In North Carolina, the Long March to Raleigh sought to spotlight racially biased maps and structural suppression of Black political power. Artists and performers canceled shows at the newly renamed Trump Kennedy Center, using cultural boycotts to protest the personal branding of a national arts institution. Advocates encouraged public comments to defend trans youth against harmful policies and campaigned for the Block the Bombs Act to end U.S. funding for Israeli military actions in Palestine. Protest, boycott, and petition remained live tools.
Alongside protest, a quieter layer of governance continued to function on procedural, evidence‑based lines. Agencies like the CDC, FCC, FDA, OSHA, EPA, Census Bureau, TSA, and GSA carried out routine tasks: holding open advisory meetings on worker health, adjusting civil penalties for inflation, setting user fees, authorizing emergency animal drugs, renewing safety data collections, updating mileage reimbursement rates, and revising pipeline security information. NIH leadership resumed grant funding after an illegal freeze was exposed. The Social Security Administration canceled planned phone‑service cuts after public outcry. These actions did not reverse the week’s authoritarian drift, but they preserved parts of the administrative state that still operated under norms of expertise and public service. Quiet competence persisted beneath the noise.
The week’s small inward movement on the Democracy Clock thus captured a complex picture. Executive power widened through emergencies and centralized control over coercive tools. Law was used more openly as an instrument against disfavored groups, regions, and institutions. Economic decisions blurred into patronage and cronyism. Information and memory were managed through secrecy, propaganda, and selective enforcement. At the same time, courts, legislatures, agencies, and civil society mounted responses that slowed, documented, or partially redirected these trends. The erosion of the moral floor continued, not through a single dramatic act, but through the steady normalization of practices that once would have been seen as extraordinary. The danger lay in how ordinary they were beginning to feel.
