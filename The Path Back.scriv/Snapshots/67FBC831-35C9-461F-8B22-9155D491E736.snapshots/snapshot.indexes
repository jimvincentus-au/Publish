        <Text>Democracy depends on the simple idea that power has limits. A republic can survive disagreement, inefficiency, and even periods of poor leadership, but it cannot survive a government that treats the law as a weapon for friends and a threat for everyone else. The promise at the heart of the American experiment is not that leaders will always be wise or virtuous, but that they will always be bound. Authority is permitted on the condition that it remains accountable, and the law applies in the same way to those who govern and those who are governed. When that line blurs—when prosecutions are pressured, pardons are politicized, or force is outsourced to private interests—the difference between a constitutional republic and a patronage state begins to fade.

Constraint is more than a design choice in an old document. It is a daily practice. It is the expectation that prosecutors follow evidence rather than political orders; that law enforcement serves the public rather than private patrons; that agencies enforce rights without fear of retaliation; and that clemency is used as a remedy for injustice, not a shield for power. Constraint protects the public from abuses carried out behind closed doors or under the cover of urgency. It is the system that keeps any president, cabinet official, or billionaire from treating the state as an extension of their will. Without it, institutions become instruments of whoever holds office, and the law becomes something to be managed rather than obeyed.

Recent events have shown just how fragile that culture of constraint can be. Inside the Justice Department, prosecutors were pressed to dismiss a corruption case against a major-city mayor, not because the facts had changed, but because political priorities had. Career lawyers were gathered, given an hour to choose between dropping charges or losing their jobs. Several resigned, including a U.S. attorney who concluded she could not square the directive with her oath. In another office, a senior criminal division chief stepped down after refusing to open a baseless investigation into a contract issued by the previous administration. These are not ordinary disagreements about strategy. They are moments when the machinery of justice is bent toward the preferences of those in power—and when the people inside that machinery are forced to decide whether to serve the law or serve its temporary custodians.

The pattern extends beyond a single case. When federal prosecutors walk away rather than sign their names to decisions they believe are politically tainted, it signals a larger problem: the erosion of prosecutorial independence. When labor regulators who protect workers’ rights are fired in ways that weaken an entire agency, or when mass dismissals sweep through civil service offices without clear justification, it sends another message—that public servants exist at the pleasure of political leaders, not at the service of the law. And when a private security team tied to a powerful businessman is deputized by federal marshals, blurring the line between public authority and private loyalty, it suggests that the tools of enforcement can be placed in the hands of those whose primary obligation is not to the Constitution, but to a client.

Constraint also falters when the government uses its coercive power in ways that deter people from exercising their rights. Authorizing immigration agents to lie in wait at courthouses and mandatory check-ins, arresting people who appear to comply with the law, may produce quick statistics—but it undermines the integrity of the system. When immigrants, including those with minimal or no criminal records, learn that showing up for a scheduled hearing may lead to detention or deportation, the rational response is fear. Courts depend on participation. So does any system of fair process. Turning compliance into vulnerability weakens respect for law and drives people out of the open and into the shadows, where neither accountability nor safety is well served.

Clemency, too, reveals how constraint can be either honored or undermined. When a president commutes the sentence of an aging Indigenous activist whose case has long raised serious concerns about prosecutorial misconduct and fairness, clemency functions as the Framers intended: a fail-safe against injustice the courts have not corrected. Mercy, in that sense, restores confidence in the system by acknowledging past wrongs. But when pardons are used to reward those who took part in an attack on democratic institutions, or to insulate allies and officials from future retaliation, they send the opposite signal. The power granted to temper justice becomes a tool to mute accountability. The public is left to wonder whether allegiance to the law matters as much as allegiance to the person holding the pen.

These episodes illuminate the principle that sits at the heart of constraint: no one, not even the president, sits above the law or outside it. In the framework of democratic repair, this is the Promise of lawful government and the Imperative of accountable power. It is also part of the Moral Floor—the minimum standard without which no other reform can hold. A country can debate spending levels, social policy, or foreign commitments. It cannot credibly call itself a republic if prosecutors are pressed to serve political deals, if independent agencies are gutted for doing their jobs, or if clemency becomes a private guarantee of impunity. The law must remain a common reference point, not an instrument adjusted to suit the moment.

The path forward is not mysterious. It begins with formalizing the independence that Americans already expect in practice. The Justice Department should be protected by statutes that insulate prosecutorial decisions from direct political interference, with clear rules for when and how senior officials may overrule career lawyers—and with mandatory public explanation when they do. Special counsels and independent prosecutors should be appointed through transparent processes with strong safeguards against removal for reasons unrelated to misconduct. Whistleblowers inside legal institutions need meaningful protection so that they can speak up without ending their careers. And Congress must ensure that retaliatory firings of regulators, board members, and other independent officials trigger review rather than quiet erasure.

Reform must also extend to the use of force and authority. Deputization of private security should be constrained by clear standards: objective need, rigorous screening, transparent oversight, and automatic expiration. Law enforcement in and around courthouses should be guided by policies that protect, rather than chill, participation in legal proceedings. Immigration enforcement rules should distinguish between those who pose genuine threats and those whose only act is to comply with scheduled obligations. The goal is not to strip government of enforcement power, but to ensure that power is used in a way that strengthens the rule of law instead of teaching people to fear it.

The pardon and commutation power calls for its own guardrails. Mercy should be preserved as a vital tool to correct injustice, particularly where marginalized communities have borne the brunt of unfair prosecutions. But the country can set expectations and limits that reflect democratic values: prohibiting self-pardons, banning truly secret grants of clemency, and requiring that any pardon connected to an ongoing investigation be disclosed with enough detail for the public and Congress to assess its implications. Where clemency appears to have been used to obstruct justice, there should be mechanisms for inquiry and, where appropriate, accountability. These measures would not remove compassion from the system; they would protect it from being overshadowed by favoritism.

Placed within the arc of the Five Phases of repair, constraint is the pivot between crisis and renewal. When the public sees prosecutors resigning in protest, regulators removed for doing their jobs, or pardons used to protect the powerful, trust frays. When, instead, people see that misuse of power is checked, that even prominent figures face consequences, and that the tools of mercy are used to correct inherited wrongs, confidence grows. The shift is not dramatic in a single moment. It is cumulative—a steady rebuilding of the expectation that law is something all of us stand within, not something some of us stand above.

For the reader, these questions may feel distant, centered in agencies and courtrooms far from daily life. Yet their consequences are close. When regulators who enforce labor rights are pushed out, it affects whether workplaces are safe and wages are paid. When prosecutors are pressured or politicized, it affects whether corruption in local and national government is exposed or buried. When immigration enforcement deters people from appearing in court, it affects neighborhood safety and the fairness of the system that speaks in the public’s name. When clemency is used well, it signals that the country is willing to confront its own mistakes. When it is used badly, it tells ordinary citizens that there is one standard for the well-connected and another for everyone else.

The year ahead offers an opportunity to strengthen these guardrails. Elections are not only contests over policy; they are choices about how power will be used and what limits leaders will accept. Voters can ask candidates direct questions: Will you protect the independence of prosecutors? Will you support safeguards for inspectors, regulators, and whistleblowers? Will you back reforms that keep law enforcement public, accountable, and transparent? Will you treat clemency as a trust, not a weapon? Campaigns that answer these questions honestly give citizens a clear sense of how seriously they take the promise that no one is above the law.

Constraint is not about distrusting government. It is about honoring a deeper trust—that citizens place authority in the hands of leaders on the understanding that those leaders will remain bound by the same rules as everyone else. When constraint holds, presidents and officials operate within a framework that keeps their better instincts close and their worst temptations in check. When it fails, everything built on top of it—rights, representation, consent, and continuity—sits on unstable ground. The work now is to rebuild the habits and rules that keep power within its proper bounds, so that the law once again feels like a common home rather than a set of doors that open for some and close on others.</Text>
