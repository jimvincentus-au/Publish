# Week 36 Appendix: Dissent as Domestic Terror

This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The most powerful structural pressures came from the executive’s open weaponization of law enforcement and national security tools against perceived enemies, and from the judiciary’s increasing willingness to ratify that power. The Antifa “terrorist organization” order and the domestic terrorism memorandum together normalize emergency-style authorities aimed at left-leaning protest and nonprofits, while DOJ indictments of James Comey and new criminal probes of Brennan and Bolton signal that prosecutorial power is now a central instrument of political retribution. Simultaneously, the purge and politicization of the civil service and justice apparatus deepened: Erik Siebert was fired and replaced by loyalist Lindsey Halligan; DOJ’s Public Integrity Section has been hollowed out; and ICE and HUD are being repurposed toward ideological and nativist goals. Press freedom and information integrity took heavy blows via Pentagon access pledges, FCC threats, and presidential attacks on critical coverage, even as some institutions (federal courts, state coalitions, congressional oversight) mounted partial resistance. Internationally, the administration leveraged tariffs, sanctions, and foreign aid to reward allies and punish critics, while undermining climate and human-rights commitments. Overall, the week shows a system where formal institutions still exist but are being rapidly bent to serve a personalized, retaliatory presidency.
