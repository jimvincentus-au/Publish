\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 15 Appendix: Decrees as Government\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, concentrated in executive aggrandizement, weaponization of law, and information control. Trump\'92s use of emergency authorities and sweeping executive orders\'97on tariffs, immigration, education, independent regulators, civil service reclassification, and disaster relief\'97pushes the system toward rule by decree and away from congressional budgeting and statutory limits. Law enforcement and the Justice Department were repeatedly deployed against political opponents (ActBlue, immigration lawyers, blue states\'92 climate suits, voting-rights enforcement) while simultaneously shielding corporate and donor corruption through pardons, dropped investigations, and a pause in FCPA and crypto prosecutions. Civil and political equality eroded sharply: birthright citizenship, refugee admissions, TPS, sanctuary jurisdictions, DEI, environmental justice, and LGBTQ and trans rights all came under coordinated attack, often via constitutionally dubious orders. Parallel moves targeted the knowledge and accountability infrastructure\'97civil rights lawyers at DOJ, climate and health science agencies, universities, public broadcasting, and school curricula\'97replacing independent expertise with loyalists, AI-driven deregulatory tools, and propaganda channels like White House Wire. Courts, state officials, and civil society mounted notable resistance, but the net structural effect of the week is a marked tilt toward centralized, personalized, and opaque executive rule.\
