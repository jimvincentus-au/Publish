\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 1 Appendix: Emergencies as Operating System\
\
This was an extraordinary rupture week: a newly re\uc0\u8209 installed president used the opening days of his term to attempt a structural re\u8209 write of the American state. The dominant pattern is rule by executive fiat, with sweeping orders on immigration, citizenship, climate, civil service, DEI, reproductive rights, and foreign alignment, many of them plainly at odds with statute or the Constitution. Emergency powers and national\u8209 security framings are deployed to militarize the border, suspend asylum and refugee programs, and justify mass deportations. Simultaneously, the justice system is bent toward retribution and impunity: over 1,500 January 6 offenders and other ideologically aligned criminals are pardoned, while DOJ is tasked with pursuing political enemies and sanctuary officials, and civil\u8209 rights enforcement is frozen. The administrative state is politicized and partially privatized through Schedule F, DOGE, Musk\'92s embedded role, and attacks on independent regulators and inspectors general. Internationally, the U.S. retreats from WHO, Paris, and UN human\u8209 rights bodies while opening new channels for opaque foreign influence via presidential crypto and Trump\u8209 branded deals. Counter\u8209 pressures exist\'97federal courts blocking the birthright order, state lawsuits, civil\u8209 society mobilization\'97but they are reactive against a concentrated, multi\u8209 front authoritarian push.\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Joe Biden commuted Leonard Peltier\'92s life sentence to home confinement (2025-01-20): The commutation for a long\uc0\u8209 imprisoned Indigenous activist highlighted executive clemency as a corrective tool for alleged prosecutorial misconduct and raised expectations that presidents address historic injustices within the justice system.\
\
2. President Joe Biden issued pre\uc0\u8209 emptive pardons to family members and officials tied to January 6 investigations (2025-01-20): Biden\'92s protective pardons for relatives and officials, framed as shielding them from future retaliation, underscored how presidential clemency can be used to insulate allies from potential legal exposure in a polarized system.\
\
3. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris publicly declared the Equal Rights Amendment to be law despite lack of ratification (2025-01-20): The administration\'92s inaccurate claim that the ERA was already law blurred the line between symbolic advocacy and constitutional reality, risking public confusion about how amendments are validly adopted.\
\
4. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second term and delivered a populist inaugural address (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s return to office, accompanied by factually dubious claims about justice, immigration, and the economy, set a confrontational tone for executive\uc0\u8209 legislative relations and public trust in official statements.\
\
5. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border and framed migration as an invasion (2025-01-20): Border emergency declarations expanded presidential authority to deploy troops and redirect resources for immigration enforcement, normalizing emergency powers in an area traditionally governed by statute and courts.\
\
6. President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency to accelerate fossil fuel development (2025-01-20): By invoking emergency powers to fast\uc0\u8209 track fossil fuel projects and roll back climate safeguards, the administration used crisis framing to bypass ordinary environmental review and legislative debate.\
\
7. President Donald Trump issued sweeping executive orders restructuring immigration enforcement and asylum access (2025-01-20): A cluster of orders suspended asylum and refugee programs, expanded expedited removals, and militarized border control, concentrating discretion in the executive branch and weakening statutory protections for migrants.\
\
8. President Donald Trump issued executive orders attempting to end or restrict birthright citizenship (2025-01-20): Orders redefining citizenship for U.S.\uc0\u8209 born children of non\u8209 citizens directly challenged the Fourteenth Amendment, testing whether a president can unilaterally alter constitutional guarantees of equal citizenship.\
\
9. President Donald Trump issued executive orders redefining gender in federal policy and curbing transgender rights (2025-01-20): By mandating binary sex definitions, banning trans athletes in women\'92s sports, and restricting gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care for minors, the administration used executive power to narrow civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people.\
\
10. President Donald Trump rescinded Biden\uc0\u8209 era executive actions including DEI, climate, Covid, and equity measures (2025-01-20): Mass rescission of 78 prior orders dismantled policy frameworks on racial equity, LGBTQ+ protections, climate, and public health, illustrating how unilateral tools can rapidly reverse multi\u8209 year governance agendas.\
\
11. President Donald Trump reclassified thousands of federal employees under Schedule F to ease political firings (2025-01-20): Reinstating and expanding Schedule F weakened civil\uc0\u8209 service protections for policy\u8209 influencing roles, enabling large\u8209 scale replacement of career experts with loyalists and eroding bureaucratic independence.\
\
12. President Donald Trump issued mass pardons and commutations for January 6 participants and other aligned offenders (2025-01-20): Full or partial clemency for more than 1,500 January 6 defendants and other ideological allies signaled that violence and lawbreaking on behalf of the regime may be exempt from normal accountability.\
\
13. President Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road online drug marketplace (2025-01-22): The high\uc0\u8209 profile pardon for a major dark\u8209 web drug trafficker raised questions about how ideological or political considerations can override deterrence and consistency in federal sentencing.\
\
14. President Donald Trump issued pardons for anti\uc0\u8209 abortion activists convicted under the FACE Act (2025-01-22): Clemency for activists convicted of obstructing clinic access weakened enforcement of federal protections for reproductive health facilities and signaled tolerance for ideologically motivated interference with lawful medical services.\
\
15. President Donald Trump ordered investigations into alleged weaponization and censorship by the prior administration (2025-01-20): Directing DOJ and intelligence leaders to probe supposed past censorship and weaponization risked turning investigative powers into tools for retribution against political opponents and prior officials.\
\
16. President Donald Trump revoked security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials (2025-01-20): Stripping clearances from former officials accused of election\uc0\u8209 related disloyalty blurred the line between legitimate security concerns and punishment for political speech, potentially chilling expert criticism.\
\
17. President Donald Trump restored the federal death penalty and urged aggressive capital prosecutions (2025-01-20): Reinstating executions and pressing DOJ to seek death sentences, including in politically charged categories, expanded the most severe state punishment while courts and advocates debate its fairness and application.\
\
18. President Donald Trump ordered DOJ to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban despite statute and court rulings (2025-01-20): Delaying a congressionally mandated TikTok divest\uc0\u8209 or\u8209 ban law, partly for political reasons, highlighted executive willingness to under\u8209 enforce statutes and court decisions when they conflict with electoral interests.\
\
19. President Donald Trump launched personal cryptocurrencies and promoted them while in office (2025-01-20): By creating and touting TRUMP\uc0\u8209 branded coins with large insider allocations, the president opened a novel channel for opaque enrichment and potential influence\u8209 buying tied directly to his public role.\

\
21.

\
22. President Donald Trump threatened or conditioned federal disaster aid and FEMA\'92s role on political and policy demands (2025-01-23): By suggesting FEMA could be dismantled and tying wildfire aid to state policy changes or voter ID, Trump signaled willingness to use disaster relief as leverage over subnational governments.\
\
23. President Donald Trump fired or removed senior security and transportation officials including the Coast Guard commandant and TSA head (2025-01-21): Targeted removals of Admiral Linda Fagan and TSA leadership, partly over DEI and policy disagreements, showed how personnel purges can reshape security institutions along ideological lines.\
\
24. President Donald Trump froze DOJ civil rights enforcement and police\uc0\u8209 reform agreements (2025-01-23): Halting new civil\u8209 rights cases and consent decrees redirected federal law enforcement away from protecting vulnerable groups and toward the administration\'92s priorities, weakening a key accountability mechanism.\
\
25. President Donald Trump ordered national health agencies to pause external communications and advisories (2025-01-21): A communications blackout at HHS, CDC, FDA and related agencies curtailed the flow of scientific and health information, centralizing message control in the executive during ongoing public\uc0\u8209 health risks.\
\
26.

\
29.

\
30. President Donald Trump signed orders enforcing the Hyde Amendment and reinstating the global gag rule on abortion funding (2025-01-24): By tightening bans on federal and foreign aid funding for abortion\uc0\u8209 related services, the administration used fiscal levers to restrict reproductive health access domestically and abroad.\
\
31. President Donald Trump directed deployment of active\uc0\u8209 duty troops and Marines to the U.S.\'96Mexico border (2025-01-22): Sending thousands of soldiers to perform border missions blurred lines between military and civilian law enforcement, raising concerns about domestic use of armed forces in routine policy disputes.\
\
32. President Donald Trump froze funding for infrastructure and clean\uc0\u8209 energy projects under major recent laws (2025-01-23): Suspending disbursements from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act allowed the White House to unilaterally stall congressionally approved investments, shifting budgetary power toward the executive.\
\
33. President Donald Trump fired or reassigned senior DOJ national security and criminal division officials (2025-01-21): Removing top career DOJ leaders in sensitive divisions risked politicizing federal prosecutions and national\uc0\u8209 security decisions by replacing experienced officials with more compliant figures.\
\

\

\
38. President Donald Trump fired or froze civil\uc0\u8209 rights division leadership and cases at DOJ (2025-01-23): Stopping new civil\u8209 rights filings and changing supervision inside DOJ curtailed federal capacity to enforce anti\u8209 discrimination laws, especially in voting and policing.\

Institutions and Governance\
\
1.

\
6. California and a coalition of states and cities filed lawsuits challenging Trump\'92s birthright citizenship order as unconstitutional (2025-01-23): State\uc0\u8209 led litigation against the citizenship order underscored the role of subnational governments in defending constitutional norms when federal executive actions threaten established rights.\
\
7. Federal courts issued temporary restraining orders blocking Trump\'92s attempt to end birthright citizenship (2025-01-23): Multiple judges, including a Reagan appointee, halted implementation of the citizenship order as \'93blatantly unconstitutional,\'94 demonstrating judicial checks on executive overreach.\
\
8. Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family, and U.S. courts reached a $7.4 billion settlement over opioid litigation subject to court approval (2025-01-23): The massive settlement, requiring Sacklers to relinquish control of Purdue, illustrated how civil litigation can impose accountability on powerful firms for public\uc0\u8209 health harms when regulatory oversight has failed.\
\
9. Ohio legislature enacted a law allowing high fees for access to police body\uc0\u8209 camera and other video (2025-01-24): Authorizing up to $750 charges for body\u8209 cam footage created financial barriers to public records, weakening transparency and external oversight of law enforcement conduct.\

\
11. Mississippi State Representative Justin Keen introduced a bill to create an Illegal Alien Certified Bounty Hunter Program (2025-01-23): The proposal to pay private bounty hunters per deportation would outsource coercive state functions to incentivized actors, raising due\uc0\u8209 process and abuse concerns in immigration enforcement.\
\
12. Representative Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment resolution to allow a third presidential term (2025-01-23): Seeking to loosen term limits specifically to permit another Trump run challenged a core structural safeguard against personalist entrenchment in the presidency.\
\
13. Trump administration dismantled the federal police misconduct database (2025-01-20): Eliminating a national database of police misconduct reduced centralized oversight of law\uc0\u8209 enforcement abuses and made it harder for policymakers and the public to track problem officers.\
\
14.

\
7. President Donald Trump launched and profited from TRUMP and MELANIA cryptocurrencies while exchanges promoted them (2025-01-21): The president\'92s memecoins, heavily held by his own company and listed by regulated exchanges under investigation, created a direct, volatile financial stake in his political brand and regulatory posture.\
\
8. Trump Organization and Jared Kushner\'92s Affinity Partners pursued new foreign real\uc0\u8209 estate and investment deals including Trump Tower Belgrade (2025-01-22): Large foreign\u8209 backed projects and a $2 billion Saudi investment in Kushner\'92s fund, some involving state\u8209 leased land, deepened financial entanglements between the president\'92s family businesses and foreign governments.\
\
9.

\
12. California state government implemented a $20 minimum wage for fast\uc0\u8209 food workers (2025-01-22): Raising the sectoral minimum wage in California strengthened labor standards for low\u8209 wage workers and tested how state\u8209 level policy can counterbalance national economic trends.\
\
13. Indiana General Assembly introduced a bill to revoke tax\uc0\u8209 exempt status for non\u8209 profit hospitals overcharging patients (2025-01-22): Tying tax benefits to pricing practices sought to hold large hospital systems accountable for high charges, using fiscal tools to discipline powerful health\u8209 care providers.\
\
14. Teamsters union authorized a strike against Costco over pay, leave, and surveillance issues (2025-01-20): Strike authorization at dozens of warehouses highlighted worker pushback against corporate labor practices and the role of unions in contesting workplace surveillance and benefits.\
\
15. House Republicans and President Donald Trump pursued large spending cuts alongside tax reductions in a reconciliation bill (2025-01-23): Coordinated plans for tax cuts financed by deep program reductions illustrated how fiscal policy choices can reallocate resources from social insurance to higher\uc0\u8209 income beneficiaries.\
\
16. Trump Organization expanded merchandise sales tied to Trump\'92s return to the White House (2025-01-24): A surge of new products on Trump\'92s online store monetized the presidency\'92s symbolism, reinforcing concerns about using public office to drive private retail revenue.\

\
2.

11. President Donald Trump signed an order to end perceived anti\uc0\u8209 Christian bias in government (2025-01-20): Creating a taskforce to combat alleged discrimination against Christians risked privileging one faith in federal policy debates and potentially undermining neutral enforcement of civil\u8209 rights laws.\
\
