<h1>Week 29 Appendix: Law, Maps, and Memory as Control</h1>
<p><em>In a week of consolidation rather than shock, law, representation, and information were tightened to favor power while formal democratic shells stayed intact.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, with coordinated moves across executive power, immigration enforcement, higher education, and information control. The administration deepened its campaign to politicize neutral state functions: firing the labor statistics chief, purging FBI leadership, and weaponizing DOJ against Jack Smith and New York AG Letitia James all push traits 4, 14, 19, 22, and 51. Simultaneously, immigration and detention policy hardened dramatically—expanding ICE capacity at Fort Bliss and Indiana, entrenching ‘Alligator Alcatraz’, and conducting raids in defiance of court orders—driving traits 4, 9, 11, 46, and 47. Universities were coerced into ideological settlements and data mandates, while Harvard sued to resist, sharply affecting trait 44 and related memory traits. Aggressive mid‑decade gerrymanders in Texas and planned redistricting in Indiana, backed by threats of arrest and FBI involvement, intensified structural manipulation of representation (traits 6, 11, 15, 45). Finally, sweeping tariffs, a homelessness‑criminalization order, and cuts to food assistance and mRNA research combined economic and social policy to entrench inequality and weaken evidence‑based governance (traits 16, 26, 36, 39, 53).</p>

(2025-08-02)</li>

(2025-08-02)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump announced he had ordered nuclear submarines positioned in response to Russian statements: Publicly brandishing nuclear deployments in response to rhetoric, apparently amid domestic political pressure, used strategic military assets as a political tool, heightening risks of miscalculation and weakening norms around restrained nuclear signaling. (2025-08-02)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on India over its continued imports of Russian oil: Linking punitive tariffs to India’s energy dealings with Russia leveraged U.S. trade power for geopolitical aims, risking coercive economic pressure on a partner nation outside multilateral processes.

(2025-08-02)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump pressed the Senate to scrap the blue slip tradition for judicial nominees: Urging elimination of the blue slip custom would reduce minority‑party senators’ influence over judicial picks, centralizing appointment power in the executive and majority leadership. (2025-08-03)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump urged the Senate to cancel its August recess to accelerate confirmations: Pressuring senators to forgo recess to speed confirmations emphasized filling posts with loyalists over deliberative review, tightening executive influence over the judiciary and key offices.

(2025-08-07)</li>
<li>President Donald Trump announced a new census plan excluding undocumented immigrants from the count: Ordering work on a census that omits undocumented residents directly challenged the constitutional requirement to count all persons, threatening to skew representation and federal funding toward favored constituencies.

<li>Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. canceled roughly $500 million in federal mRNA vaccine research contracts: Terminating dozens of mRNA vaccine projects on contested scientific grounds shifted federal health research away from a key platform, potentially weakening preparedness and subordinating evidence to ideological preferences. (2025-08-06)</li>

<li>President Donald Trump issued an executive order tightening oversight of federal grantmaking to align with administration priorities: Requiring senior appointees to screen grants for ideological fit increased the risk that federal funding decisions would reward aligned groups and penalize disfavored communities or viewpoints.

</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>

(2025-08-02)</li>
<li>U.S. Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia: Installing a staunch Trump ally with a record of election‑fraud claims as D.C.’s top federal prosecutor deepened concerns that charging decisions in a pivotal jurisdiction would reflect loyalty rather than impartial law enforcement. (2025-08-02)</li>
<li>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer replaced a clean‑energy advocate on the utilities commission with an industry‑aligned member: Swapping a regulator critical of rate hikes and fossil dependence for an industry‑friendly appointee shifted a key oversight body toward utility interests, affecting long‑term energy affordability and climate policy.
