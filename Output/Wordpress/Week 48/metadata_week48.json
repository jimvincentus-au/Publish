    "square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a brass desk clock frozen at 8:11, a stack of heavily redacted documents stamped with a generic government seal, a gavel resting atop an immigration case file, and a small model of a border wall. Behind them, a framed portrait space shows only a blank, sun-faded rectangle where a leader\u2019s image once hung, while a new, oversized commemorative medal bearing an abstract presidential silhouette leans against it. The lighting is dramatic and painterly, emphasizing contrast between light on the documents and deep shadow encroaching from the edges.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit Washington, D.C. streetscape in painterly realism: the Capitol dome and Supreme Court in the distance, flanked by looming federal office blocks whose windows glow with cold fluorescent light. In the foreground, a large, slightly blurred wall-mounted clock reads just past 8 p.m., its minute hand subtly edging toward midnight. On one side, heavily armed officers in dark tactical gear move through a residential-looking street; on the other, archivists and scientists pack boxes under the watch of suited officials. Banners and plaques bearing presidential imagery are being hoisted over older civic symbols. The mood is tense and subdued, with long shadows and a sense of quiet consolidation rather than open chaos."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 48 of Trump\u2019s second term was a study in consolidation rather than spectacle. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:11 p.m., yet moved 0.3 minutes closer to midnight as law, force, and story were drawn more tightly into the presidency\u2019s orbit. The Supreme Court effectively legalized racial profiling in immigration enforcement, while ICE raids, travel-ban expansion, and coercive tactics against children hardened a tiered citizenship regime. National-security frameworks bled into ordinary governance through a fentanyl-as-WMD order, a naval blockade and terrorism label for Venezuela, and terrorism charges against anti-ICE protesters. Knowledge and oversight infrastructures were weakened: NCAR faced dismantling, university research funds were frozen, and public health agencies were captured by anti-vaccine leadership. Simultaneously, archives and memory were curated from above, with biased presidential plaques, a bid to rename the Kennedy Center, and Justice Department defiance of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Courts, local governments, and civil society mounted real but insufficient resistance to this quiet tightening.",
