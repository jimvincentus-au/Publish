\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 2 Appendix: Citizenship as Executive Property\
\
This week represents an acute acceleration of authoritarian consolidation centered on the presidency. Trump\'92s team simultaneously attacked multiple guardrails: mass firings of inspectors general and FBI/DOJ prosecutors, Schedule F\'96style politicization of the civil service, and sweeping funding freezes that attempted to override Congress\'92s power of the purse. In parallel, the administration pardoned or commuted sentences for January 6 offenders and Stewart Rhodes, while dismantling public records and databases about the insurrection\'97normalizing paramilitary violence in defense of the regime. Immigration and citizenship became core tools of stratification: emergency powers, Guant\'e1namo expansion, ICE quotas and raids in schools and churches, the Laken Riley Act, TPS rescissions, and an executive order to end birthright citizenship (temporarily blocked) all push toward a tiered legal order. A coordinated rollback of DEI, LGBTQ protections, and civil-rights enforcement across the military, federal workforce, prisons, and education system deepened structural inequality. Courts, state governments, civil society, and some Republicans mounted notable resistance\'97blocking the funding freeze, birthright order, and pushing lawsuits over civil service politicization and church raids\'97but the net structural pressure overwhelmingly favored executive dominance, crony capitalism, and a curated, amnesiac public memory.\

\
2. President Donald Trump canceled flights for 1,600 Afghan refugees (2025-01-25): Canceling refugee flights for Afghans who aided U.S. forces signaled willingness to abandon vulnerable allies for domestic political goals, weakening U.S. credibility and the expectation that state power protects those who assist it.\
\
3. President Donald Trump declared an emergency at the southern border and signed sweeping immigration enforcement orders (2025-01-25): Declaring a border emergency and expanding enforcement, including arrests in schools and churches, normalized emergency framing for routine policy and broadened executive discretion over who is targeted by state coercion.\
\
4. President Donald Trump issued executive orders dismantling federal DEI and affirmative action programs and revoking contractor nondiscrimination rules (2025-01-25): Rolling back long\uc0\u8209 standing equal opportunity and DEI rules shifted federal power away from enforcing anti\u8209 discrimination norms, weakening protections for women and minorities in public employment and contracting.\
\

\
8.

10. President Donald Trump directed the military to resume delivery of 2,000\uc0\u8209 pound bombs to Israel (2025-01-25): Ordering renewed heavy\u8209 bomb shipments over prior restraints concentrated war\u8209 making influence in the executive and tied U.S. power more closely to a controversial ally\'92s military campaign.\
\
11. President Donald Trump proposed relocating Gaza\'92s population to other countries (2025-01-25): Advocating mass relocation of Gazans treated a vulnerable population as a bargaining chip, signaling disregard for self\uc0\u8209 determination norms that underpin democratic legitimacy abroad.\
\
12. White House personnel teams under President Donald Trump screened civil\uc0\u8209 service applicants for loyalty to the president (2025-01-25): Loyalty vetting for career posts blurred the line between partisan appointees and neutral administrators, undermining a core safeguard against personalist control of the state.\
\
13. President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring an energy emergency to roll back appliance efficiency standards (2025-01-26): Invoking an \'93energy emergency\'94 to weaken efficiency rules used emergency powers to override technocratic regulation, privileging short\uc0\u8209 term political messaging over long\u8209 term public\u8209 interest standards.\
\
14.

\
17. Office of Management and Budget under President Donald Trump rescinded the memo freezing federal funding after court orders and public backlash (2025-01-29): Rescinding the funding freeze after multiple injunctions showed that judicial and political resistance could still constrain executive overreach, though only after significant disruption to public programs.\

President Donald Trump issued executive orders stripping civil servants of protections and creating Schedule Policy/Career (2025-01-24): Transforming large swaths of the career civil service into at\uc0\u8209 will positions tied to presidential policy loyalty eroded nonpartisan administration and made bureaucratic power more personally dependent on the incumbent.\

\
23. President Donald Trump issued executive orders banning transgender military service and abolishing military DEI programs (2025-01-27): Barring transgender people from service and dismantling DEI structures in the armed forces used commander\uc0\u8209 in\u8209 chief authority to narrow who may serve and whose perspectives shape military culture.\
\
24. President Donald Trump issued an executive order reinstating service members discharged over COVID\uc0\u8209 19 vaccine mandates (2025-01-27): Reinstating and compensating troops removed for vaccine refusal overrode prior public\u8209 health judgments and signaled that ideological alignment with the president could outweigh compliance with earlier lawful orders.\
\
25. President Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a national missile defense \'93Iron Dome for America\'94 (2025-01-27): Mandating a vast new missile\uc0\u8209 defense architecture concentrated strategic defense planning in the executive and could justify large, opaque security expenditures with limited legislative shaping.\
\
26. President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care for minors and cutting related federal funding (2025-01-28): Defunding and prohibiting gender\u8209 affirming care for youth used federal spending power to impose contested medical norms, curtailing access for a targeted minority and politicizing clinical decisions.\
\
27. President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to target undocumented immigrants as a crime threat (2025-01-28): Framing undocumented residents as \'93alien enemies\'94 responsible for crime extended a wartime statute into domestic policing, legitimizing extraordinary measures against a disfavored population on dubious factual grounds.\
\

\
29. President Donald Trump signed executive orders ending birthright citizenship for U.S.\uc0\u8209 born children of noncitizens (2025-01-28): Attempting to nullify birthright citizenship by executive order directly challenged the Fourteenth Amendment and sought to stratify citizenship by parentage and status rather than place of birth.\
\
30. President Donald Trump ordered deportation flights to Colombia to resume after tariff and visa pressure (2025-01-28): Restarting deportation flights following economic and diplomatic coercion showed how trade and visa tools could be wielded to force other states to facilitate U.S. removal policies.\
\
31. President Donald Trump paused approvals for new renewable energy projects on public lands and waters (2025-01-28): Blocking new renewable projects on federal lands shifted federal energy policy toward fossil interests and used administrative control over land to slow climate\uc0\u8209 mitigation infrastructure.\
\
32. President Donald Trump signed an executive order repealing federal\uc0\u8209 level AI safety concerns (2025-01-28): Removing federal AI safety guidance prioritized rapid deployment over precaution, reducing institutional capacity to manage technological risks that can affect democratic processes and rights.\

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on aviation safety rolling back diversity initiatives at the FAA (2025-01-31): Linking a fatal crash to diversity hiring and ordering a return to \'93merit\uc0\u8209 based\'94 staffing used tragedy to justify dismantling inclusion policies and reshape federal hiring narratives.\

\
46.

\
