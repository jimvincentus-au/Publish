The event, inspired by France's Bastille Day celebrations, featured military vehicles and troops marching through the streets of the U.S. capital. This parade is a rare occurrence in the United States, where such displays of military might in civilian settings are not common. Critics have expressed concerns about the authoritarian undertones of the event, drawing parallels to similar displays in countries like Russia, China, and North Korea.",
