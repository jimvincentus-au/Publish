\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 26 of Trump\'92s second term marked a dense, structural turn in democratic backsliding. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:57 to 7:58 p.m., but the small movement concealed heavy engineering. Schedule G and mass purges at DOJ, State, Education, NIH, and the VA pushed the civil service toward open politicization, while courts and Congress largely blessed executive freedom over personnel and budgets. Immigration enforcement became a laboratory for rule by exception: lethal raids, bond-hearing bans, rapid deportations, and abusive detention were fused with new IRS and Medicaid data pipelines, deepening surveillance of ordinary people as elite misconduct stayed opaque. Public broadcasting, foreign aid, climate science, and economic statistics were cut or constrained, narrowing trusted information channels. Law was redeployed to shield allies, harass critics, and manage the Epstein files controversy. Pockets of resistance\'97from court injunctions to mass protests\'97persisted, but they could not offset a week in which improvisations hardened into infrastructure.\
