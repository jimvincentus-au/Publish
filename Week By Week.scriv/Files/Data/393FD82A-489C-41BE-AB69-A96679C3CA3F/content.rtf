\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 23 Appendix: Force as System of Rule\
\
This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran without congressional authorization, followed by a Supreme Court decision sharply limiting nationwide injunctions. Together they expand executive freedom of action while constraining judicial remedies, directly intensifying traits 1 and 4 (unchecked executive power and law as weapon). Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is transformed into a sprawling, semi-militarized apparatus: masked agents, record detentions, new mega\uc0\u8209 facilities, and plans to dismiss asylum claims and deport to third countries, all amid credible allegations of DOJ defiance of court orders. That cluster drives severe deterioration in rule of law, stratified citizenship, and security forces aligned with regime priorities. Information control and epistemic sabotage deepen: mass firings and defunding threats at Voice of America, politicized vaccine panels and anti\u8209 science decisions, and systematic contradiction of U.S. intelligence on Iran. Courts and some state actors still resist\'97blocking parts of emergency declarations, ordering return of a deportee, protecting federal workers\'92 bargaining rights\'97but these are outweighed by structural moves that entrench authoritarian tools in war powers, immigration, public health governance, and the information sphere.\
