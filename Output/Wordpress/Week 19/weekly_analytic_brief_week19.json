    "Executive branch: consolidates power via executive orders, immigration machinery, politicized pardons, and targeted funding decisions, increasingly substituting decree for negotiated policy.",
    "Judiciary: issues a flurry of injunctions against immigration, tariffs, and retaliatory orders, yet the Supreme Court simultaneously enables harsh immigration rollbacks, signaling a split and partial capture at the apex.",
    "Civil service and foreign policy apparatus: State and DHS are retooled toward deportation and ideological loyalty, with remigration plans, merit hiring guidelines, and office closures weakening traditional diplomatic and analytic functions.",
    "Media and education sectors: public broadcasters and elite universities are openly punished for perceived disloyalty, forcing them into defensive litigation and coalition-building to preserve autonomy.",
    "Civil society: decentralized protest movements (50501, Fox/Palantir/Tesla campaigns) and organized parent groups leverage existing laws and courts to contest authoritarian and illiberal policy moves."

  "summary": "This week shows an executive-centered project maturing into a system-wide challenge to liberal democracy. Trump\u2019s record pace of executive orders, floated suspension of habeas corpus, and aggressive use of clemency for corrupt allies deepen the sense that law is a weapon, not a limit. Immigration becomes the primary testing ground: daily arrest quotas, the planned Office of Remigration, visa freezes, and Supreme Court green lights for ending parole and TPS collectively stratify legal status by origin and ideology. Simultaneously, universities and public media are targeted as rival centers of authority\u2014Harvard is financially punished and surveilled, NPR and PBS defunded, while courts temporarily shield some of these institutions. Trade and foreign policy are bent toward personal and crony gain, with Vietnam\u2019s Trump projects and Boeing\u2019s treatment emblematic. Yet the judiciary, state attorneys general, universities, parents, and mass protest movements mount significant resistance, blocking some orders and exposing overreach. Structurally, the week intensifies pressures on executive dominance, civil service politicization, information control, and citizenship stratification, while also revealing that courts and civil society remain active, if embattled, counterweights.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Executive maximalism and legal brinkmanship: record executive orders, floated habeas suspension, mass pardons, and tariff fights push presidential power to and beyond constitutional edges, daring courts and Congress to respond.",
    "Immigration as core authoritarian laboratory: arrest quotas, remigration office plans, visa freezes, TPS and parole rollbacks, and social media vetting turn migration policy into a tool for mass exclusion and fear.",
    "Coordinated assault on knowledge institutions: Harvard, NPR, PBS, public radio, and universities face funding cuts, surveillance, and enrollment caps, while Oklahoma rewrites curricula with conspiracies and Christian nationalism.",
    "Crony capitalism and self-dealing in governance: Vietnam golf deals, Boeing\u2019s treatment, Bitcoin treasuries, and policy-linked investment products blur lines between public policy, private enrichment, and market manipulation.",
    "Countervailing legal and civic resistance: federal judges, state AGs, universities, parents, and nationwide protest networks repeatedly block or slow executive initiatives, showing institutional muscle but also growing strain."
