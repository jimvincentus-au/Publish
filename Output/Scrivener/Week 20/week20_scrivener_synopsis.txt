Week 20 of Trump’s second term registered almost no visible movement on the Democracy Clock, yet the underlying structure of power shifted further toward consolidation. Immigration enforcement became an overt instrument of political control: record ICE raids, collateral arrests, and the creation of an Office of Remigration turned status into a standing vulnerability, while National Guard and Marines were deployed against largely peaceful anti-deportation protests. A sympathetic Supreme Court expanded executive reach, upholding the firing of the NLRB chair, greenlighting a Musk-linked “efficiency” unit’s access to Social Security data, and allowing the termination of humanitarian paroles for hundreds of thousands. Simultaneously, budget bills and executive orders hollowed out the safety net, privatized veterans’ care, and weakened reproductive protections, even as tax cuts and crypto-friendly legislation favored elites. Public media, universities, and scientific agencies faced funding threats, censorship, and symbolic erasures. Courts, broadcasters, and civil society mounted pockets of resistance, but the week’s through-line was normalization: law as weapon, surveillance as infrastructure, and inequality as design.
