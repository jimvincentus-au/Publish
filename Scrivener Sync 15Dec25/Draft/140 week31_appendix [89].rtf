\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 31 Appendix: Emergency as Standing Rule\
\
This week shows an executive moving aggressively to consolidate personal and partisan power while hollowing out institutional checks. The most intense pressures fall on civil-military boundaries, rule of law, electoral integrity, and the status of immigrants and dissenters. Trump\'92s federalization and arming of D.C. police and National Guard, plus deployments to Los Angeles and threats to expand to other cities, normalize emergency-style governance and align security forces with regime preservation rather than public safety. Simultaneously, sweeping immigration crackdowns\'97mass visa revocations, continuous social-media vetting, expanded detention infrastructure, and Pentagon support for ICE\'97entrench a stratified citizenship regime. On elections, the drive to ban mail-in voting, Texas\'92s mid-decade gerrymander, and counter-gerrymanders in California together signal a shift from contesting voters to contesting maps and rules. Inside the state, loyalist appointments at DOJ, FBI, BLS, and ODNI, plus politicized prosecutions and raids on critics, deepen capture of the justice and intelligence apparatus. Information control and historical revision\'97attacks on Smithsonian exhibits, climate science rollbacks, and pressure on health authorities\'97round out a pattern of chaos and narrative warfare used to disable accountability.\
\
Week 31 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump pardoned individuals convicted or charged for January 6 Capitol riot offenses (2025-08-16): By pardoning roughly 1,500 January 6 offenders, the president removed legal consequences for an attack on the transfer of power, weakening deterrence against future assaults on electoral institutions and signaling impunity for politically aligned violence.\
\
2. President Trump announced plans and directed lawyers to draft an executive order to ban mail-in voting and certain voting machines (2025-08-18): The president\'92s move to end mail-in voting and restrict machines via executive order would centralize election control in the executive branch and curtail established voting methods, undermining state authority and access to the ballot.\
\
3. President Trump declared a public safety emergency and placed Washington, D.C., police under temporary federal control while deploying National Guard troops (2025-08-18): Federalizing D.C.\'92s police and deploying Guard troops despite falling crime rates concentrated policing power in the executive, normalizing emergency rule over a largely self-governing city and weakening local democratic control.\
\
4. President Trump called on state legislatures to end mail-in voting and move to paper ballots (2025-08-22): Urging state lawmakers to abolish mail-in voting and change ballot methods to benefit his party used presidential influence to reshape election rules for partisan gain rather than neutral administration.\
\
5. President Trump signed a directive authorizing military action against Latin American drug cartels designated as foreign terrorist organizations (2025-08-22): Authorizing military operations against cartels under a terrorism label expanded presidential war-making discretion, risking conflict without clear congressional mandate and straining international legal norms.\
\
6. President Trump ordered the removal of homeless people from Washington, D.C., streets under threat of fines or jail (2025-08-16): Directing punitive sweeps of homeless residents framed social policy as a policing problem, using state coercion against a vulnerable group rather than rights-based services and due process protections.\
\
7. President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer after an unfavorable jobs report (2025-08-18): Removing the BLS chief over a data release he disliked signaled that independent economic statistics must align with presidential narratives, pressuring technocrats to serve political interests over factual reporting.\
\
8. President Trump publicly called for the release of convicted former clerk Tina Peters and threatened harsh measures if she remained imprisoned (2025-08-21): Demanding freedom for an ally convicted of election-related crimes and hinting at retaliation challenged judicial independence and suggested loyalty to the leader can outweigh jury verdicts.\
\
9. President Trump threatened to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and called for her resignation over alleged mortgage fraud (2025-08-20): Pressuring a sitting Fed governor to resign under contested allegations risked politicizing an institution meant to be insulated from partisan control, potentially undermining monetary policy independence.\
\
10. President Trump announced support for Ukraine ceding the Donbas region to Russia to end the war (2025-08-16): Endorsing territorial concessions to Russia signaled U.S. willingness to trade another country\'92s sovereignty for expediency, weakening norms that protect smaller democracies from coercive aggression.\
\
11. President Trump joked that elections could be canceled in 2028 if the U.S. were at war (2025-08-18): Suggesting that war might justify canceling elections normalized the idea that emergencies could suspend core democratic processes, eroding taboos around regular, peaceful transfers of power.\
\
12. President Trump directed the launch of an official White House TikTok account while pausing a congressionally mandated ban (2025-08-20): Using a platform Congress had ordered sold or banned while delaying enforcement highlighted executive willingness to sidestep legislative security judgments when politically advantageous.\
\
13. President Trump signed an executive order creating the America by Design initiative to improve federal service design (2025-08-21): Establishing a centralized design office to modernize federal services aimed to improve usability and trust, modestly strengthening state capacity and citizen access to government programs.\
\
14. President Trump signed an executive order to expand access to mental health treatment for people in crisis (2025-08-21): Easing pathways into treatment for people experiencing mental health crises sought to address public safety and welfare through care rather than solely punitive responses.\
\
15. President Trump signed a tax bill restructuring federal student loan borrowing caps and repayment options (2025-08-21): Capping federal borrowing and eliminating some graduate loan programs shifted higher-education costs onto students, likely reducing access for lower-income borrowers and reshaping who can afford advanced degrees.\
\
16. President Trump signed a spending megabill repealing many Biden-era green energy incentives (2025-08-19): Rolling back clean-energy incentives through a large spending bill favored fossil fuel interests, raised energy costs, and weakened federal support for a lower-carbon economy.\
\
17. President Trump signed a directive ending paper-based federal payments, prompting FEMA\'92s email-only aid rule (2025-08-22): Eliminating paper payments and requiring digital access for disaster aid risked excluding people without reliable internet or email, especially elderly and disabled survivors, from timely relief.\
\
18. President Trump called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook\'92s resignation following a criminal referral (2025-08-20): Publicly demanding the resignation of the Fed\'92s first Black woman governor amid contested allegations risked chilling diverse participation in independent economic institutions and suggested political litmus tests for service.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Florida Supreme Court upheld a DeSantis-backed congressional map that reduced Black voting power in northern Florida (2025-08-16): By approving a map that diminished Black voters\'92 influence despite a state ban on partisan and racial gerrymandering, the court weakened constitutional safeguards for fair representation and entrenched partisan advantage.\
\
2. Texas Judge Megan Fahey issued a restraining order blocking Beto O\'92Rourke\'92s group from sending funds to Democrats outside Texas (2025-08-17): Restricting a political organization\'92s ability to move funds across state lines during a redistricting fight constrained opposition organizing and raised concerns about courts being used to limit partisan activity.\
\
3. Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi impaneled a grand jury to investigate alleged Obama-era treason during the 2016 election (2025-08-18): Launching a grand jury into baseless claims of a treasonous conspiracy by a prior administration used prosecutorial tools to legitimize political narratives, blurring law enforcement and partisan retribution.\
\
4. Newsmax settled Dominion Voting Systems\'92 defamation lawsuit for $67 million over 2020 election lies (2025-08-18): Paying a large settlement for false claims about voting machines underscored that courts can impose financial penalties on outlets that spread election disinformation, modestly reinforcing accountability for attacks on electoral integrity.\
\
5. Coalition of Democratic-led states and Washington, D.C. sued the Justice Department over efforts to tie Victims of Crime Act funds to immigration enforcement cooperation (2025-08-18): Challenging DOJ\'92s attempt to condition crime-victim funding on compliance with immigration crackdowns sought to defend state autonomy and prevent federal financial coercion of sanctuary policies.\
\
6. Federal courts issued mixed rulings on the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention facility, including restraining expansion and later ordering closure and relocation of detainees (2025-08-18): Judges first halted expansion and later ordered closure of a controversial detention center over rights and environmental violations, showing courts can still check abusive detention policies despite partial dismissals and state resistance.\
\
7. Federal judge in Illinois dismissed the Trump administration\'92s challenge to the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act (2025-08-19): Upholding Illinois\'92 workplace privacy protections against a federal immigration-law challenge preserved state authority to shield workers\'92 data and limited federal preemption claims tied to immigration enforcement.\
\
8. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blocked a Texas law requiring Ten Commandments displays in public school classrooms (2025-08-20): Enjoining mandatory religious displays in classrooms reaffirmed First Amendment limits on state endorsement of religion and protected pluralism in public education.\
\
9. U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that Alina Habba was unlawfully serving as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey (2025-08-20): Finding that a former Trump lawyer held a U.S. attorney post without lawful appointment exposed executive efforts to bypass Senate confirmation and underscored the importance of statutory procedures for prosecutorial offices.\
\
10. Federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status for certain immigrants while litigation continues (2025-08-20): Permitting TPS terminations to move forward during ongoing challenges exposed tens of thousands of long-term residents to potential removal, highlighting judicial deference to restrictive executive immigration policies.\
\
11. Federal appeals court in New York overturned a roughly $500 million civil fraud penalty against Donald Trump as excessive while leaving some business restrictions (2025-08-21): Reducing a massive fraud penalty against a former president while affirming misconduct raised questions about whether powerful defendants receive more lenient financial sanctions than ordinary litigants.\
\
12. Federal judge Richard Berman rejected the Trump administration\'92s request to unseal Jeffrey Epstein grand jury materials (2025-08-20): Keeping Epstein grand jury records sealed to protect victims and avoid diversionary disclosures balanced transparency demands against privacy and investigative integrity in a politically charged case.\
\
13. Federal judge ruled that the State Department cannot deny visas solely based on Trump\'92s travel ban for 19 countries (2025-08-21): Limiting visa denials tied directly to a broad travel ban narrowed executive discretion over affected immigrants and modestly restored individualized consideration in visa adjudications.\
\
14. New York Attorney General and courts oversaw class action lawsuits filed against Delta and United Airlines over windowless seats (2025-08-21): Passenger suits over allegedly misleading airline seating practices illustrated how civil litigation can be used to enforce consumer rights and corporate transparency in mass-market services.\
\
15. Department of Justice began investigating Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud following a referral (2025-08-21): Opening a criminal probe into a sitting Fed governor after a politically charged referral risked entangling central bank governance in partisan conflict, even as it nominally pursued equal enforcement of financial laws.\
\
16. Supreme Court of the United States partially granted a stay in NIH v. American Public Health Association, pausing restoration of certain grants but leaving voided guidance in place (2025-08-21): The Court\'92s split emergency order on NIH grant guidance shaped how quickly research funding rules could be reinstated, reflecting high-level judicial influence over scientific grant administration.\
\
17. Election Assistance Commission received and opened comments on a petition to require documentary proof of citizenship for federal voter registration (2025-08-21): Considering a rule to mandate citizenship documents for federal registration could impose new barriers for eligible voters lacking paperwork, shifting election access rules through administrative channels.\

18. House Oversight Committee began receiving and reviewing Jeffrey Epstein-related documents from the Justice Department (2025-08-21): Congressional review and planned release of Epstein files, with protections for victims, aimed to increase transparency around elite misconduct while navigating tensions with DOJ over pace and scope of disclosure.\
\
19. National Institutes of Health and Supreme Court had NIH grant directives partially stayed, affecting restoration of research funding (2025-08-21): The partial stay on NIH grant restoration delayed funding for some public health research, illustrating how emergency court orders can quickly reshape scientific support structures.\
\
\
Economic Structure\
\
1. Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee imports and raised duties on other coffee-producing countries (2025-08-16): Sharp coffee tariffs disrupted supply chains for U.S. businesses and consumers while pressuring foreign producers, using trade policy in ways that can raise domestic costs and strain international economic relations.\
\
2. Environmental Protection Agency under Trump appointees moved to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding for greenhouse gases (2025-08-18): Undoing the core legal basis for federal climate regulation weakened the government\'92s ability to limit emissions, favoring fossil fuel interests over long-term environmental and public health protections.\
\
3. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. terminated 22 federally funded mRNA vaccine development projects worth $500 million (2025-08-18): Canceling major mRNA research investments over ideological objections undermined evidence-based public health innovation and redirected federal resources away from proven vaccine platforms.\
\

\
5. U.S. government and Intel pursued converting Chips and Science Act funding into a non-voting equity stake in Intel (2025-08-19): Seeking an equity position in a major chipmaker marked a shift toward direct state ownership in strategic industry, raising questions about corporate influence, risk-sharing, and democratic oversight of industrial policy.\
\
6. Congress and President Trump enacted a budget reconciliation bill projected to trigger large automatic cuts to Medicare and Medicaid (2025-08-19): A deficit-increasing bill set up nearly $1.5 trillion in future cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, shifting fiscal burdens onto seniors and low-income people and shrinking core social safety nets.\
\
7. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a new policy requiring more subjective, holistic evaluations of citizenship applicants\'92 moral character (2025-08-19): Embedding broad behavioral and \'93societal norms\'94 tests into naturalization decisions increased discretion and the risk of bias, making access to citizenship more contingent on officials\'92 value judgments.\
\
8. Trump administration proposed a rule to bar Public Service Loan Forgiveness for employees of entities deemed to undermine national security or American values (2025-08-20): Tying student loan forgiveness eligibility to employers\'92 perceived alignment with national values politicized a financial benefit and could chill work at disfavored organizations.\
\
9. Immigration and Customs Enforcement planned to spend over $2.4 million on customized SUVs and militarized branding without open bidding (2025-08-20): Awarding noncompetitive contracts for militarized vehicles with propaganda-style slogans raised transparency concerns and illustrated how enforcement agencies can channel public funds into image-building.\
\
10.

\
11. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rescinded embargoes on importing civets, Lucky Bamboo in water, and Haitian goat-skin handicrafts (2025-08-22): Lifting long-standing health-related import bans in the name of deregulation reduced trade barriers but also shifted reliance onto updated science and other safeguards to manage disease risks.\
\
12. Trump administration clawed back over $12 million in federal grants from California\'92s public health program over alleged promotion of gender ideology (2025-08-21): Revoking health grants on ideological grounds punished a state program\'92s content choices, using federal funding leverage to enforce cultural preferences in public health services.\
\
13. Trump administration canceled union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers via executive order after a favorable appeals ruling (2025-08-22): Voiding collective bargaining agreements for about 400,000 federal employees weakened organized labor in the civil service and concentrated managerial power over working conditions.\

\
\
Civil Rights and Dissent\
\
1. U.S. State Department halted issuance of medical visas for children from Gaza seeking treatment in the United States (2025-08-16): Suspending humanitarian visas for sick children based on politicized security claims restricted life-saving care and signaled that immigration decisions can be driven by ideological pressure rather than individualized risk assessments.\
\
2. Texas House Democrats left the state to block a mid-decade redistricting vote and later returned under threat of fines, arrest, and surveillance (2025-08-16): Walking out to deny quorum, then returning under trooper monitoring and threat of civil arrest, highlighted extreme tactics around redistricting and the pressure placed on minority legislators resisting partisan maps.\
\
3. Texas House leadership and law enforcement locked Representative Nicole Collier in the chamber and threatened her with charges while imposing 24-hour surveillance protocols on Democrats (2025-08-18): Confining a lawmaker and assigning troopers to monitor colleagues to force attendance at a redistricting vote used coercive policing against elected officials, chilling legislative dissent.\
\
4. Trump administration and DHS leadership threatened to arrest leaders of Democratic cities that refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement (2025-08-17): Threatening local officials with arrest for sanctuary policies weaponized federal criminal power against political opponents and undermined local self-governance on policing priorities.\
\
5. Trump administration implemented sweeping policy changes restricting international students\'92 visas, status, and participation in activism (2025-08-18): Delays, revocations, expanded surveillance, and arrests targeting international students\'97especially those engaged in pro-Palestinian activism\'97made educational access and speech rights more precarious for noncitizens.\
\
6. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and State Department expanded continuous vetting and social media screening of tens of millions of visa holders and applicants for anti-American activity (2025-08-21): Monitoring 55 million visa holders\'92 behavior and online speech for ideological cues turned immigration status into a tool of political control, heightening surveillance and chilling expression among noncitizens.\
\
7. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted aggressive raids and detentions in schools and communities, including using hotels as ad hoc detention sites (2025-08-19): ICE operations that frightened families away from schools, seized workers in surprise raids, and held people in hotels blurred lines between civil enforcement and arbitrary detention, undermining trust in public spaces.\
\
8. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 18-year-old Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz in Los Angeles using masked agents and an unmarked vehicle (2025-08-20): The masked, unmarked-vehicle detention of a recent high school graduate resembled a kidnapping to witnesses, intensifying fear in immigrant communities and raising due process concerns.\
\
9. American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal petition challenging ICE\'92s continued detention of journalist Mario Guevara as retaliatory (2025-08-21): Arguing that ICE jailed a reporter to silence coverage of raids highlighted how immigration detention powers can be used to intimidate the press and suppress scrutiny of enforcement practices.\
\

\
11. North Carolina legislature advanced HB 781 to criminalize unauthorized camping and sleeping, effectively targeting homelessness (2025-08-20): Proposing to criminalize sleeping in public spaces turned poverty into a law-enforcement issue, exposing unhoused people to arrest rather than services and raising human rights concerns.\
\
12. City of Grants Pass, Oregon settled a lawsuit by agreeing to provide accessible camping spaces and services for unhoused people with disabilities (2025-08-20): Committing to designated camping areas, water, and ADA compliance after litigation showed local governments can adjust punitive homelessness policies in response to disability and civil rights claims.\
\
13.

\
16. North Carolina legislature advanced HB 958 to require full Social Security numbers for voter registration and restructure the elections board (2025-08-20): Mandating full SSNs for registration and altering a previously nonpartisan elections board risked deterring voters over privacy concerns and increasing partisan control of election administration.\
\
17. America First Legal Foundation petitioned the Election Assistance Commission to require documentary proof of citizenship for federal voter registration (2025-08-21): Seeking federal-level proof-of-citizenship requirements would add documentation hurdles that disproportionately burden naturalized citizens and low-income voters, narrowing the electorate under the banner of integrity.\
\
18. Election officials in Iowa certified Democrat Catelin Drey\'92s special election victory flipping an Iowa state senate seat (2025-08-19): A Democratic win that broke a Republican supermajority in the Iowa Senate showed competitive elections can still alter power balances and restore some checks on executive appointments.\
\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1. Trump administration officials left sensitive State Department documents on a public hotel printer and then falsely downplayed them as a lunch menu (2025-08-16): Mishandling and then misrepresenting sensitive diplomatic documents undermined basic information security and public confidence in the government\'92s candor about national security lapses.\
\
2. Bureau of Labor Statistics and White House saw the BLS commissioner fired and a loyalist nominee with January 6 ties put forward to lead the agency (2025-08-18): Replacing an independent statistics chief with a politically aligned figure signaled that official economic data may be curated to match leadership\'92s narrative rather than objective measurement.\
\
3. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the American Academy of Pediatrics of a pay-to-play scheme over its COVID-19 vaccine guidance (2025-08-19): Attacking a major medical society as corrupt for recommending vaccination undermined trust in professional health guidance and amplified skepticism toward evidence-based public health advice.\
\
4. President Trump and the White House criticized and ordered reviews of Smithsonian exhibits on slavery, race, trans identity, and immigration (2025-08-21): Targeting national museum content for focusing on slavery and marginalized histories signaled an effort to steer public memory away from structural injustice toward a more flattering national narrative.\
\
5. Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched a militarized social media recruitment campaign featuring aggressive imagery and slogans (2025-08-20): Branding ICE with combat-style visuals and slogans on social media framed immigration enforcement as a battlefield, shaping public perception and potential recruits\'92 attitudes toward migrants.\
\
6. State Department fired top press officer Shahed Ghoreishi after he drafted a statement opposing forced Palestinian relocations (2025-08-20): Removing a spokesperson over language critical of forced relocations suggested foreign policy messaging is tightly controlled to avoid positions disfavored by allies, narrowing the range of official discourse.\
\
7. Department of Justice released heavily redacted transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell interviews about Jeffrey Epstein\'92s associations (2025-08-22): Publishing curated Maxwell transcripts while halting broader Epstein disclosures shaped public understanding of elite networks around Epstein, balancing transparency with control over which connections were emphasized.\
\
8. President Trump and allied media continued promoting false claims that mail-in voting is fraudulent while settlements showed prior election lies were costly (2025-08-19): Persisting in unfounded attacks on mail-in ballots despite defamation settlements over similar lies kept disinformation central to election debates and eroded trust in legitimate voting methods.\
\
9. Trump administration used crime statistics narratives and investigations to justify federal takeover of D.C. policing despite low crime rates (2025-08-19): Questioning D.C. crime data and probing alleged manipulation while declaring an emergency allowed the administration to frame a low-crime city as dangerous, legitimizing expanded federal control.\
\
10.

\
2. President Trump announced plans for an executive order to end mail-in voting and restrict voting machines (2025-08-18): Trump\'92s plan to ban mail-in ballots and many voting machines via executive order would usurp state control of elections and restrict voting methods, undermining constitutional structures and access to the ballot.\
\
3. President Trump called on state legislatures to end mail-in voting and switch to paper ballots (2025-08-22): Urging legislatures to abolish mail-in voting and change ballot methods to favor his party uses political pressure to reshape election rules for partisan gain rather than neutral administration.\
\
4. President Trump declared a public safety emergency and federalized Washington, D.C.\'92s police (2025-08-18): Declaring an emergency despite falling crime and placing D.C. police under federal control concentrates policing power in the executive and sidelines local democratic governance.\
\
5. President Trump ordered large deployments of National Guard and federal agents to Washington, D.C. (2025-08-16): Sending thousands of Guard troops and federal agents into the capital for routine crime control blurs civil\'96military boundaries and normalizes military-style presence in civilian governance.\
\
6. President Trump deployed Marines and federalized California National Guard forces to Los Angeles (2025-08-17): Using Marines and federalized Guard troops in Los Angeles protests stretches domestic military deployment norms and raises risks of force being used to suppress dissent rather than protect rights.\
\
7. President Trump threatened harsh measures if convicted election clerk Tina Peters is not released (2025-08-21): Threatening unspecified harsh measures to secure release of a convicted election official pressures the justice system to favor allies and undermines respect for jury verdicts.\
\
8. President Trump called for the firing or resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook (2025-08-20): Pressuring a sitting Federal Reserve governor to resign under contested allegations threatens central bank independence and risks politicizing monetary policy for partisan advantage.\
\
9.

\
10. President Trump ordered the removal of homeless people from Washington, D.C. streets under threat of fines or jail (2025-08-16): Forcing unhoused residents off public streets under threat of punishment uses coercive state power to manage poverty, raising concerns about criminalizing vulnerable populations instead of providing services.\
\
11. President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over an unfavorable jobs report (2025-08-18): Removing the BLS chief after a report that contradicted presidential claims pressures statistical agencies to align data with political narratives rather than objective measurement.\
\
12. President Trump nominated E.J. Antoni, a loyalist and January 6 participant, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2025-08-18): Installing a partisan ally with a history of election denial to head BLS risks turning official economic statistics into tools of political messaging rather than neutral public information.\
\
13. President Trump criticized the Smithsonian for focusing on slavery and ordered legal review of its exhibits (2025-08-21): Directing lawyers to scrutinize museum exhibits on slavery and injustice uses executive influence to pressure cultural institutions\'92 historical narratives toward a more favorable view of the nation.\
\
14. President Trump signed an executive order creating the America by Design initiative (2025-08-21): Creating a centralized National Design Studio and Chief Design Officer to standardize federal service design can improve usability but also centralizes control over how citizens experience government interfaces.\
\
15.
