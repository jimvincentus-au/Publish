In the lit half, a large ornate clock reads 8:11, its glass cracked but still ticking. On the steps, suited figures exchange folders stamped with dollar signs and passports, while in the shadows, rows of riot police and immigration agents load people onto unmarked buses. In the background, digital billboards display censored economic charts with missing data, and distant cargo ships and LNG terminals glow on the horizon. Painterly, realistic style, moody, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 46 of Trump\u2019s second term registered almost no visible movement on the Democracy Clock, but the underlying structure shifted. The presidency turned clemency into a shield for corrupt elites and foreign power brokers, while a Reuters-documented retaliation campaign showed law used as a weapon against critics. Simultaneously, immigration policy hardened into group-based exclusion: threats to strip citizenship, a blanket asylum freeze, nationality-based re-reviews, expanded travel bans, and aggressive raids that sometimes ignored court orders. Security forces were pushed toward regime protection, from alleged war-crime-level narco-boat strikes to politicized FBI priorities and the rollback of protections for LGBTQ+ prisoners. Economic and foreign policy fused with Trump-family business interests, and key economic indicators were suppressed even as a \u201cmedia offenders\u201d site targeted critical outlets. Courts and Congress offered uneven resistance, and transparency around Epstein files and January 6 violence advanced, but the week\u2019s through-line was normalization of impunity and stratified citizenship.",
