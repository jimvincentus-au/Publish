These tariffs are expected to lead to higher prices for American consumers, particularly in the retail sector, as companies like Target and Best Buy anticipate passing on the increased costs to consumers. The tariffs have prompted retaliatory measures from Canada, which imposed its own tariffs on US exports worth C$30bn, and China, which plans to impose tariffs on US farm products.",

This move is intended to fund Donald Trump’s tax cuts, mass deportations, and defense investments. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that achieving these cuts without affecting Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) is impossible, as the committee oversees only $381 billion in spending outside these programs. The CBO's assessment highlights the potential impact on healthcare for millions of Americans.",
