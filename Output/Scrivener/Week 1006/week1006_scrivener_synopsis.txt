This chapter defines the Democracy Clock’s “moral floor” and argues that no constitutional design can survive leaders who lack basic civic ethics. The narrative traces how the American founding generation assumed a class of honorable officeholders, and how early voluntary restraints—from Washington’s retirement to Adams’s peaceful concession—stabilized the young republic. Over time, politics hardened into career and identity, shame eroded, and the law became a ceiling rather than a floor. The chapter distills six essential traits—character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship—as the cultural guardrails that keep power from becoming predation. Drawing on historical examples from the late Roman Republic to modern hollowed-out democracies, it shows how internal decay, not foreign conquest, usually kills republics. The Democracy Clock will measure breaches in this moral floor as accelerants of democratic collapse, setting a standard for what “noon” looks like before testing the model against real-world events.
