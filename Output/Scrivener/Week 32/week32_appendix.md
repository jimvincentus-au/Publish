# Week 32 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance

This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the executive moving aggressively on three fronts: militarized control of Democratic jurisdictions, weaponization of law enforcement and regulatory power against opponents and vulnerable groups, and structural attacks on labor, public health, and electoral fairness. Plans and orders to federalize policing and deploy National Guard units in Washington, Chicago, Baltimore, and sanctuary cities, plus creation of specialized Guard units, push traits 1, 5, 9, and 11 sharply toward entrenched emergency rule. Parallel DOJ and ICE actions—politically targeted investigations, coercive plea tactics, opaque transfers, and retaliation against detainees and whistleblowers—intensify law-as-weapon dynamics (trait 4) and stratified citizenship (trait 47). The firing of CDC director Susan Monarez, installation of an unqualified loyalist, and mass resignations at CDC mark a serious blow to civil service independence and science-based governance (traits 16, 22, 53). On the socioeconomic side, nationalization-lite of Intel, deep labor rollbacks, and tariff shocks embed crony capitalism and inequality (traits 16, 35, 36, 38). Simultaneously, redistricting maneuvers, threats to mail voting, and litigation over maps escalate structural manipulation of representation (trait 45), even as a few court rulings and state-level elections show residual democratic resistance.
