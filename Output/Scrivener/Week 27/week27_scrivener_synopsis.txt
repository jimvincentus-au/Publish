Across Week 27 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock inched from 8:06 to 8:09 p.m., a modest 2.6‑minute advance that masked a dense layering of structural change. Immigration enforcement hardened into a standing internal security system: ICE’s budget tripled, a 5,000‑bed Fort Bliss complex and tent camps expanded long‑term detention, Medicaid data on 80 million people flowed to ICE, and masked agents swept courthouses and streets, sometimes detaining citizens and journalists. Parallel moves re‑engineered the economic and informational chassis of the state. A new tax law deepened inequality, tariffs raised prices, and crypto and AI policy were written around insider interests, intertwining Trump’s wealth with federal strategy. Universities and media learned that grants, mergers, and press access now hinged on ideological compliance, while AI‑generated arrest videos, bot networks, and curated archives blurred truth and memory. Courts and state actors blocked some excesses, but mostly in reaction, as law, money, and information were repurposed to protect the regime rather than the public.
