Behind them, a brass clock reads 8:11. A faint shadow of barbed wire and a surveillance camera falls across the scene, suggesting law, memory, and enforcement under strain.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit Washington, D.C. streetscape in painterly realism: the Capitol dome dimly lit in the background, a large clock face hovering in the sky frozen at 8:11 p.m., federal office buildings with some windows dark and others glowing. In the foreground, a line of weary federal workers and immigrant families pass under surveillance cameras and armed officers, while a distant museum facade is being draped with a giant neutral banner, hinting at erased exhibits. The mood is tense and somber, with rich, realistic detail and dramatic lighting."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 43 unfolded as a consolidation of methods rather than a burst of new outrages. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:11 p.m., with a slight backward drift of 0.3 minutes, reflecting a system under mounting strain but not yet in free fall. The record\u2011length shutdown ended on the president\u2019s terms: agencies reopened and back pay flowed, yet core disputes over health subsidies and food assistance were deferred. Trump used the standoff to threaten unpaid air traffic controllers and stage\u2011manage national parks, turning public services into props. Immigration enforcement escalated from biometric tracking and abusive raids to extraterritorial detention in El Salvador, even as federal judges in Chicago and Illinois re\u2011imposed due\u2011process limits. Law and clemency were openly instrumentalized: a pardon for Binance founder CZ, politicized DOJ probes, efforts to dismantle the CFPB, and purges of housing watchdogs entrenched elite impunity. Simultaneously, the administration moved to sanitize Smithsonian exhibits and starve museums, while Congress and survivors forced a looming vote on releasing Epstein files, making transparency and public memory central battlegrounds.",
