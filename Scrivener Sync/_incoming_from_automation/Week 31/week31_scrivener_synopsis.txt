Week 31 traces a tightening loop in which the tools of the American state are turned inward to police belonging and entrench power. In Washington, D.C., a manufactured crime “emergency” justifies federal control of local police, armed National Guard patrols, and the insertion of military lawyers into civilian prosecutions. In Los Angeles, troop deployments face belated legal tests over whether any boundary still constrains domestic militarization. Immigration enforcement becomes both spectacle and business model: masked ICE raids, hotel detentions, branded “DEFEND THE HOMELAND” fleets, and plans for agency-owned deportation planes. The same logic reaches visas, citizenship, and education, as continuous social‑media vetting, mass visa revocations, and subjective “moral character” tests stratify status by origin and ideology. Elections are narrowed under the banner of “honesty,” with threats to mail voting and partisan gerrymanders enforced by troopers and permission slips. Law, data, and memory are bent toward regime narratives, even as scattered court rulings and local resistance show that not every lever has been captured. The Democracy Clock moves from 11:14 p.m. to 11:17 p.m., reflecting cumulative, systemic erosion rather than a single dramatic break.
