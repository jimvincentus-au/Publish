While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the static position of the Democracy Clock at 8:11 p.m.",
