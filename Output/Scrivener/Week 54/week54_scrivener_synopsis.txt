Week 54 of Trump’s second term is less a single crisis than a pressure system settling in. Operation Metro Surge turns Minneapolis into a de facto occupation zone, with ICE and Border Patrol conducting raids in homes, schools, and churches, killing Alex Pretti and Renee Good, and obstructing state investigations. Parallel abuses inside ICE detention, including deaths in custody and child deportations, reveal a national enforcement system where status and race shape who receives due process. Courts and advocates mount an ad hoc counteroffensive: emergency stays, class actions, and Judge Schiltz’s order cataloging ninety‑six ICE violations. In Washington, Congress uses DHS funding and hearings to probe ICE and Kristi Noem, even as Trump reshapes security leadership, redirects intelligence toward 2020 “fraud,” and elevates an election denier at DHS. AI propaganda, platform suppression of anti‑ICE tools, and corporate surveillance infrastructure fuse information control with enforcement. The Democracy Clock barely moves, not for lack of danger, but because resistance still slows the slide.
