This decision reverses his earlier promise that no existing infrastructure would be torn down. The demolition has been met with criticism from White House alumni and historians, who view it as a symbolic destruction of historical architecture. The project is privately funded by major corporations and individuals, and it proceeded without approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees such renovations.",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported significant staffing shortfalls at six major airports, including Los Angeles International Airport, which led to a ground stop affecting the southern California region. The shutdown has forced approximately 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 TSA officers to work without pay, exacerbating the staffing crisis. The situation has resulted in thousands of flight delays and increased pressure on air traffic controllers, who are now seeking additional employment to compensate for lost income.",
