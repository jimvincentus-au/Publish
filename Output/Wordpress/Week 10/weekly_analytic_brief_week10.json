    "The presidency asserted expansive control over elections and federal funding levers, using executive orders to dictate voter registration standards, ballot-counting rules, and punitive measures against states and contractors.",
    "The judiciary acted as a partial brake\u2014blocking some executive initiatives (DOGE data access, trans military ban, Alien Enemies Act use, RFE funding cuts) and upholding Sullivan\u2014but faced direct rhetorical and structural threats.",
    "The civil service and enforcement apparatus were further politicized, with mass-firing litigation, reassignment of agents to immigration crackdowns, controversial appointments, and DOGE\u2019s expanding role in voter and agency data.",
    "Regulatory and funding agencies (HHS, USAID, public health and research funders) were steered toward ideological and donor-aligned goals, cutting health, research, and terrorism-tracking programs while privileging favored industries.",
    "Media and information institutions saw mixed movement: public and international broadcasters gained temporary judicial protection even as the executive escalated delegitimization campaigns and threatened defunding."

  "oddities_or_open_questions": [
    "The pro-bono deals with major law firms to avert punitive executive orders blur lines between settlement, extortion, and policy; it remains unclear how these arrangements are structured legally and who oversees compliance.",
    "The administration\u2019s simultaneous use of Signal for sensitive military planning and its call to investigate Signal\u2019s security raises questions about whether the probe is about genuine security or about controlling communications channels.",
    "The scale and targeting logic of Yemen airstrikes, alongside domestic cuts to terrorism and hate-crime tracking, suggest a reorientation of what counts as \u2018security\u2019; the internal decision-making process is opaque."

  "summary": "This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with multiple fronts moving simultaneously. The most acute pressure fell on electoral access and federalism: the executive order mandating documentary proof of citizenship and empowering DOGE to access voter lists represents a major, potentially enduring shift toward voter suppression and centralized control over elections. Immigration and citizenship policy were weaponized through data-sharing between IRS and ICE, social media vetting, aggressive deportation tactics, and threats of offshoring detainees, deepening stratified citizenship. The executive also expanded its reach over the civil service, law enforcement priorities, and independent agencies, while using tariffs, funding cuts, and targeted executive orders to reward allies and punish adversaries, fusing crony capitalism with governance. Civil liberties came under rhetorical and practical attack as protesters were labeled \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d political speech was chilled, and surveillance expanded. Courts provided some counter-pressure\u2014blocking parts of the trans military ban, DOGE data access, Alien Enemies Act use, and preserving Sullivan and Radio Free Europe funding\u2014but these wins only partially offset a week dominated by executive overreach, structural voter suppression, and the normalization of law as a weapon rather than a constraint.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Centralization of executive power via sweeping orders on elections, immigration, funding, and personnel, often backed by emergency framing and threats to noncompliant states or institutions.",
    "Weaponization of law and bureaucracy against perceived enemies\u2014law firms, protesters, immigrants, universities\u2014while allies receive pardons, special deals, and protection from accountability.",
    "Structural voter suppression and stratified citizenship through proof-of-citizenship mandates, DOGE access to voter rolls, green card pauses, and aggressive, rights-blind immigration enforcement.",
    "Crony capitalism and regulatory capture as governing method, with tariffs, funding cuts, and bespoke executive orders used to discipline firms and sectors and extract pro-bono or political concessions.",
    "Information and civil-liberties pressure: attacks on media, expanded surveillance and data-sharing, use of encrypted apps to evade records laws, and rhetoric branding dissent as terrorism or disloyalty."
