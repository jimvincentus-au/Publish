\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 42 of Trump\'92s second term records a democracy held in tense equilibrium. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:59 p.m., but only because deepening executive impunity was offset by electoral and judicial resistance. At the center was Trump\'92s defiance of court orders to fully fund SNAP, using hunger amid a shutdown as leverage against Congress. A Justice Department memo quietly narrowed \'93hostilities\'94 to sidestep war\uc0\u8209 powers limits, while Trump mused about invoking the Insurrection Act beyond judicial review. Law doubled as shield and sword: 77 pardons for 2020 election subversion figures, clemency for Binance\'92s founder and a convicted agent for China, and pressure to prosecute critics contrasted with stalled Epstein inquiries and sealed records. ICE raids, expanded detention, and outsourced bounty hunters targeted immigrants and the unhoused, even as agencies like Medicare and the FCC delivered windfalls to insiders. Yet voters rejected suppression measures and elected governors and mayors promising competence and inclusion, and some judges insisted that court orders and due process still bind.\
