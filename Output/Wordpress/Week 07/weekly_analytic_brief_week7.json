    "Executive branch: Expanded use of unilateral tools (emergency arms sales, travel bans, tariff whiplash, crypto reserve, security-clearance retaliation) signals a presidency increasingly unmoored from routine oversight.",
    "Civil service and agencies: Mass RIFs, politicized reinstatements, and loyalist appointments at Education, VA, CFPB, IAF, State, and law enforcement reconfigure bureaucracy around loyalty and outsourcing rather than expertise.",
    "Judiciary: Federal courts and the Supreme Court repeatedly constrained executive freezes, illegal firings, and research cuts, but face escalating impeachment threats, intimidation campaigns, and selective noncompliance.",
    "Congress: The House functions largely as a stage for executive messaging and partisan discipline (budget instructions, Al Green censure), with limited substantive checking of trade, aid, or civil-rights policy.",
    "Universities and schools: Funding cuts, DEI threats, book-banning campaigns, and targeted investigations weaponize federal and donor power against academic freedom and inclusive curricula."

    "Cyber posture toward Russia is officially deprioritized even as multiple agencies deny or obscure orders; the true operational status of U.S. cyber defenses and election protection remains unclear.",

  "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of the civil service, and deepening fusion of crony capitalism with state policy. Trump\u2019s team used executive orders and agency directives to reshape foreign policy toward Russia, hollow out regulatory and social-welfare capacity, and advance ideologically driven attacks on immigrants, LGBTQ people, racial equity, and universities. Mass layoffs and buyouts across Education, Social Security, VA, IRS, USDA, State, and USPS, combined with the effective shutdown of CFPB and restructuring of USAID and IAF, exert major structural pressure on traits 1, 16, 22, and 38. Simultaneously, the creation of a crypto reserve and non-enforcement of anti\u2013money laundering rules entrench elite self-dealing and financial opacity. On the rule-of-law side, courts repeatedly checked executive overreach on foreign aid, firings, workforce cuts, and research funding, modestly strengthening separation-of-powers traits even as the administration retaliated against judges and prosecutors. Internationally, the U.S. moved further away from its democratic allies toward Russia, while pausing or weaponizing aid to Ukraine and South Africa. Civil society mobilization and some state-level protections for LGBTQ rights persisted, but were outweighed by systemic authoritarian drift.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Executive overreach plus judicial resistance: sweeping orders on foreign aid, cyber posture, immigration, and crypto met a flurry of injunctions and Supreme Court pushback, producing a volatile tug-of-war over separation of powers.",
    "Dismantling and privatizing the state: DOGE-driven layoffs, agency hollowing, and program cancellations at Education, Social Security, VA, CFPB, USPS, and IAF shift core public functions toward private or partisan hands.",
    "Crony capitalism and strategic corruption: the crypto reserve, halted prosecutions, deregulation, and donor-driven appointments embed financial self-dealing into federal policy architecture.",
    "Ideological targeting of vulnerable groups and institutions: immigrants, LGBTQ people, racial minorities, universities, and DEI infrastructure face coordinated legal, symbolic, and financial attacks to redefine citizenship and acceptable dissent.",
    "Foreign policy realignment and allied unease: downgrading Russia as a threat, pausing Ukraine aid, closing consulates, and trade wars with allies erode traditional democratic coalitions and invite authoritarian influence."
