Week 5 of Trump’s second term marked a shift from experimentation to consolidation. The Democracy Clock jumped twenty‑two minutes, from 8:25 to 8:47 p.m., as executive power moved with fewer effective checks. Thousands of civil servants were fired across health, land, safety, and science agencies, while courts largely declined to intervene. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency deepened its reach into IRS, Social Security, and communications systems, seeking sensitive data under inflated claims of savings. Independent regulators and the Justice Department were pulled closer to the White House: loyalists took over U.S. attorney posts and the FBI, corruption charges against a presidential ally were dropped under pressure, and new operations targeted critics. Abroad, support for Ukraine was tied to sweeping mineral concessions, while rhetoric at home normalized the idea of a third Trump term. Simultaneously, archives, curricula, and federal websites were scrubbed of disfavored histories. The week’s through‑line was clear: state capacity, law, and memory were repurposed to serve a narrow circle of power.
