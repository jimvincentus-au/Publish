\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 23 records no movement on the Democracy Clock, but the stillness masks a hardening order. The president launches major strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities without congressional authorization, then restricts briefings and intelligence access when the operation\'92s limits leak. Congress flirts with impeachment over war powers, then retreats. A 6\'963 Supreme Court majority curtails nationwide injunctions, narrows who can sue over Medicaid and education, and expands executive leverage over health policy, turning delay and fragmentation into tools of rule. The administration seizes this space: purging vaccine advisory panels, politicizing public health, and pressuring universities through investigations and settlements. Immigration enforcement becomes a laboratory for law with weaker rights\'97masked raids, record detention, deaths in custody, and plans to evade court orders\'97backed by National Guard deployments. Political assassination and denaturalization threats signal rising violence and conditional citizenship, even as scattered judges, a stubborn Senate parliamentarian, and insurgent electoral victories show that resistance persists, increasingly uphill.\
