  "long_synopsis": "Week 50 closes the year with a still Democracy Clock, holding at 8:11 p.m., even as underlying structures shift. The administration did not claim new formal powers; it used existing ones more aggressively. Immigration enforcement was industrialized and personalized through denaturalization quotas, origin-based freezes, warehouse detention, and a $100 million ICE recruitment blitz, all under a president who publicly asserted personal command over immigration, criminal law, and renditions. Law and courts further stratified rights, enabling defunding of Planned Parenthood and criminalizing a self-managed abortion, even as some judges protected due process and agency independence. Federal vetoes punished Colorado and the Miccosukee Tribe, the Kennedy Center was refashioned around Trump\u2019s name and appointees, and public assets like DC golf courses and Social Security services were destabilized. Security forces at home and abroad were framed as instruments of ideological and religious narratives. Information was curated through censored investigations, opaque Epstein files, visa bans on anti-disinformation advocates, and official disinformation. State climate laws, grassroots marches, and school-defense campaigns showed democratic resistance, but the week\u2019s dominant movement was consolidation of an already altered normal.",
