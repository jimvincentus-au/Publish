In Week 3 of Trump\'92s second term, the pattern that had been forming snapped into clearer view. Power no longer flowed only through the visible levers of office. It moved along private channels, through a new, informal ministry run by a single billionaire, and it moved through fear, as purges and threats reached deep into the civil service and law enforcement. The week\'92s events did not yet close the space for opposition, but they changed the cost of using it. They also changed who, in practice, could see and touch the machinery of the state. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 7:34 p.m., advanced to 7:35 p.m. The half\uc0\u8209 minute shift was small, but it marked a week when several guardrails were pierced at once and when the line between public office and private power grew thinner and harder to see.\
\
The previous week had left the clock at 7:34 p.m., with institutions strained but still recognizably within the frame of a constitutional republic. By the close of Week 3, the time was 7:35 p.m., a net move of half a minute toward midnight. The change came not from a single spectacular act, but from a cluster of structural moves. Inspectors general were removed from at least a dozen agencies. The Justice Department and FBI were purged of people tied to investigations of Trump and January 6. Elon Musk\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 gained access to federal payment systems and personnel databases that touch nearly every household and every civil servant in the country. At the same time, courts, unions, and some state governments fought back, blocking a freeze on federal funds, halting a coercive buyout of federal workers, and stopping an attempt to end birthright citizenship. The clock moved because the balance between these forces shifted. Executive power and its private partners gained new reach, while the institutions meant to watch and restrain them were weakened or forced into emergency posture.\
\
The most striking development of the week was the fusion of state power with a private operation centered on Elon Musk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted Musk\'92s team access to the federal payment systems that move roughly six trillion dollars a year in Social Security checks, Medicare reimbursements, tax refunds, and grants. Reporting and lawsuits showed that this access was not confined to harmless observation. DOGE operatives could see coded payment data and, in some accounts, cancel transactions they deemed wasteful, including a free online tax filing system. At the Office of Personnel Management, Musk\'92s associates installed a new server in a conference room, outside normal procurement channels and without a required privacy assessment. They gained broad access to databases holding medical histories, Social Security numbers, and performance records for millions of federal employees, while senior civil servants were locked out of the same systems. Similar incursions took place at the Small Business Administration, the Department of Education, NOAA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Department of Energy. In each case, the pattern was the same. A private team, loyal to the president but not answerable to Congress or the public, was allowed to reach into the core systems that make the state function.\
\
This shift in control over information and payments did not occur in a vacuum. It was paired with a campaign to thin out and intimidate the professional civil service that might have resisted it. OPM, under Musk\'92s influence, emailed all federal employees with an offer of \'93deferred resignation\'94: full pay and benefits until the end of September for those who agreed to quit. The fine print told a different story. Agencies could require employees to keep working, could refuse to rescind resignations, and workers waived their right to enforce the agreement in court. Around 20,000 accepted before a federal judge stepped in to pause the program\'92s deadline and call for a hearing on its legality. At the State Department, a hiring freeze led to the abrupt termination of personal services contractors who provided security and support at embassies. At USAID, two top security officials were placed on leave after they tried to block DOGE\'92s access to classified systems. The message was clear. Those who insisted on rules and clearances risked their jobs, while those who cooperated with the new order advanced.\
\
Oversight inside agencies was also stripped away. Trump removed inspectors general from at least twelve major departments, eliminating internal watchdogs whose job is to audit spending, investigate misconduct, and report to Congress. At the same time, a Wired investigation revealed that a young engineer with ties to Musk\'92s companies had direct access to Treasury systems that could, in theory, alter payments. The combination was stark. As private actors gained unprecedented reach into the state\'92s financial and personnel arteries, the officials designed to monitor such risks were dismissed. This was not a symbolic change. It altered the daily incentives of thousands of managers and contractors, who now had fewer reasons to fear internal scrutiny and more reasons to align with political directives. It also made any later effort to rebuild routine oversight slower and harder.\
\
The Justice Department and the FBI were reshaped in parallel. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firing of roughly two dozen prosecutors who had worked on January 6 cases and other prosecutions involving Trump. Acting Attorney General James McHenry carried out Trump\'92s personal instructions to dismiss more than a dozen special counsel prosecutors. At the FBI, at least nine high\uc0\u8209 ranking officials were forced out, and the bureau was told to compile lists of agents who had worked on the Capitol riot and Trump investigations. Thousands of employees received detailed questionnaires about their roles. The FBI complied in part, sending the Justice Department a list of employee numbers and job titles. Two groups of agents sued to block the release of names, arguing that the lists would be used for retaliation. A senior FBI official in New York wrote to staff describing a climate of fear. In the same week, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded the FBI\'92s Foreign Influence Task Force and dismantled the Justice Department\'92s foreign bribery and kleptocracy units, while scaling back white\u8209 collar enforcement. The law was being redirected: away from corruption and foreign interference, and toward culture\u8209 war targets and immigration.\
\
These moves were framed and justified through a new narrative about \'93weaponization.\'94 Trump signed an executive order directing the attorney general to produce a report on the supposed weaponization of the federal government, explicitly including the special counsel cases against him. Bondi launched a \'93Weaponization Working Group\'94 to review prosecutions of Trump and January 6 defendants. In this telling, prior efforts to hold the president and his allies accountable became abuses to be exposed and reversed. The same week, Trump issued blanket pardons for more than 1,500 January 6 participants, even as some, like Andrew Taake, were arrested on unrelated charges such as soliciting a minor. The combined effect was to recast the insurrection as a wrong done to loyal supporters rather than an attack on the peaceful transfer of power, and to signal that loyalty to the president could outweigh the law. It also sent a warning to future prosecutors and agents about the personal risks of pursuing cases that touch the ruling circle.\
\
While law enforcement was bent inward, the presidency reached outward through emergency powers and foreign policy. On February 1, Trump invoked national emergency authorities to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, citing drug trafficking and illegal immigration. The tariffs were broad\'9725 percent on most goods from Canada and Mexico, 10 percent on Chinese products\'97and they broke existing trade agreements. Markets fell, and allies protested. Canada, Mexico, and China announced retaliatory tariffs and WTO complaints. Within days, after hurried negotiations and symbolic concessions on border enforcement, Trump paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, but left the threat hanging. The Postal Service briefly halted parcels from China and Hong Kong, likely tied to changes in duty\uc0\u8209 free rules, before reversing course. The pattern was one of shakedown diplomacy: use economic shock to extract concessions, then declare victory.\
\
Foreign aid and multilateral engagement were treated in the same transactional spirit. Trump froze roughly $60 billion in USAID funding for a 90\uc0\u8209 day review and moved to fold the agency into the State Department, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio declaring himself acting USAID administrator. USAID\'92s headquarters was closed, its website and social media accounts went dark, and plaques were removed from its building. Musk called the agency a \'93criminal organization\'94 and boasted that his team was shutting down federal grants. Emails later showed that the freeze was not a mere technical review of payment systems, as the administration claimed, but a deliberate halt to humanitarian programs in places like Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine. Labor unions representing USAID staff sued Trump, Rubio, and Bessent, arguing that dismantling the agency without congressional approval was unconstitutional and illegal. The administration also withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council and cut funding to UNRWA, the main agency serving Palestinian refugees, while ordering a review of all support to international organizations.\
\
The most radical foreign policy move came in Trump\'92s repeated statements about Gaza. In a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he announced that the United States would \'93take over\'94 the Gaza Strip, develop it, and resettle Palestinians elsewhere. He spoke of turning Gaza into a resort area under U.S. control. Pro\uc0\u8209 settler groups in Israel welcomed the idea. Lawmakers from both parties in Washington called it deranged and unworkable. Legal analysts described it as a proposal for ethnic cleansing. In the same week, Trump signed an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court for investigating alleged crimes by U.S. and Israeli personnel, and another halting aid to South Africa over claims\'97echoing Musk\'92s rhetoric\'97that white farmers\'92 land was being confiscated. He threatened to \'93take back\'94 the Panama Canal or do \'93something very powerful\'94 if Panama did not comply with U.S. wishes. He floated outsourcing U.S. prisoners to El Salvador\'92s mega\u8209 prison and threatened to obliterate Iran if it attempted to assassinate him. These statements and orders did not yet change borders, but they normalized talk of conquest and retribution as tools of American policy.\
\
At home, the administration used executive orders to reorder social hierarchies and civil rights. Trump revoked a 60\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old order that barred employment discrimination by federal contractors, and he directed agencies to treat many diversity, equity, and inclusion programs as illegal discrimination against white men. Federal employees were told to strip pronouns from email signatures. West Point disbanded twelve student\u8209 led clubs, including groups for women engineers, Latin culture, and LGBTQ cadets. The State Department suspended a Christian employee group that had promoted religious diversity. An order on antisemitism directed agencies to identify civil and criminal tools to use against campus protests, with a fact sheet suggesting deportation of international students who joined pro\u8209 Palestinian demonstrations. Another order banned gender\u8209 affirming care for people under nineteen at hospitals receiving federal funds, leading major institutions to suspend such services. A separate directive purged transgender service members from the military, ordered trans prisoners to be medically \'93detransitioned\'94 and moved to facilities matching their sex at birth, and barred trans women and girls from competing in female sports, with visa denials for trans athletes seeking to enter the United States. Federal judges in Washington and elsewhere stepped in to block the prison transfers and some aspects of the birthright citizenship and asylum orders, but the thrust of policy was clear. The state would now use its power to enforce a narrow vision of gender, sexuality, and belonging.\
\
Religion was drawn more tightly into this project. Trump signed an order establishing a White House Faith Office to coordinate with faith\uc0\u8209 based groups and ensure they could compete for federal funding. Another order created a task force to \'93eradicate anti\u8209 Christian bias\'94 in the federal government, chaired by the attorney general and including representatives from multiple agencies. These moves were framed as protecting religious liberty, but in practice they elevated one religious identity as especially deserving of state protection and attention. Combined with the antisemitism order\'92s focus on campus protest and the withdrawal from UN human rights bodies, they signaled a reorientation of rights discourse: away from universal protections and toward the defense of favored constituencies. They also gave the administration new tools to mobilize supporters and to cast critics as hostile to faith itself.\
\
Information itself became a contested field. CDC webpages on contraception, HIV, STIs, and gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care disappeared or reappeared in stripped\u8209 down form after Trump\'92s DEI order. Climate data at NOAA went missing after DOGE staff gained access to its systems. The National Science Foundation\'92s payment gateway suffered a five\u8209 day outage after executive orders disrupted federal grants, forcing a district court to issue a temporary restraining order to release blocked research funds. ICE quietly updated timestamps on years\u8209 old press releases about deportations, making them appear current in Google searches and stoking fear in immigrant communities. When a journalist exposed the practice, some of the updated dates vanished from search results. The Federal Communications Commission opened an investigation into a San Francisco radio station\'92s immigration reporting and reinstated a news distortion complaint involving a Kamala Harris interview, while the White House canceled millions of dollars in POLITICO subscriptions based on a conspiracy theory that the outlet was subsidized by USAID. Trump publicly called for CBS and \'9360 Minutes\'94 to be \'93terminated\'94 over alleged editing of that same interview. Meanwhile, Lara Trump moved from chairing the Republican National Committee to hosting a weekend show on Fox News. The effect was to tilt the media environment. Critical outlets faced pressure and loss of access, while a family\u8209 aligned platform gained a new voice.\
\
Against this backdrop, courts and civil society mounted a series of defensive actions. Federal judges in Washington and Seattle blocked Trump\'92s attempt to freeze grants and loans, citing a 1974 law that bars presidents from impounding funds appropriated by Congress. Another judge extended a pause on the administration\'92s funding freeze, warning of catastrophic impacts. Courts in multiple jurisdictions enjoined the birthright citizenship order, with one Reagan\uc0\u8209 appointed judge calling it \'93clearly unconstitutional.\'94 A district judge halted the federal employee buyout deadline, giving unions time to argue that the program was coercive and unlawful. The ACLU sued over an executive order that effectively suspended asylum law. Federal employee unions and three major unions representing civil servants filed suit to stop DOGE\'92s access to Treasury payment systems and to protect privacy rights. Two anonymous OPM employees went to court to shut down the servers Musk\'92s team had installed. Labor unions sued to reverse USAID cuts and the foreign aid freeze. In North Carolina, a judge found racial bias in a death row sentencing, and a class action was filed against a prison gynecologist accused of years of abuse. These cases did not reverse the week\'92s structural changes, but they showed that the judiciary and organized labor remained willing to confront executive overreach.\
\
States and localities also asserted themselves. California\'92s legislature approved $25 million to strengthen the state\'92s legal defense against the Trump administration and another $25 million for immigrant legal services. Governor Gavin Newsom met with Trump to seek wildfire aid for Los Angeles communities, while resisting conditions tied to water management, voter ID laws, and immigration enforcement. The state\'92s legislature funded legal challenges to federal climate and civil rights rollbacks. At the same time, the city of San Clemente chose to partner directly with Border Patrol on beach surveillance cameras, sidestepping California\'92s sanctuary law by relying on the fact that it has no municipal police force. In Louisiana, by contrast, state power was used to clear unhoused people from New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl, moving them to an unheated warehouse under a no\uc0\u8209 bid contract and denying press access. These divergent choices underscored how federal signals about acceptable uses of power can be amplified or resisted at the state level.\
\
Inside Congress, opposition remained real but structurally weakened. Democratic senators staged an all\uc0\u8209 night protest and filibuster against Russell Vought\'92s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget, warning that he would use the office to starve programs like Medicare and Social Security and to defy Congress on spending. They failed. Vought was confirmed on a party\u8209 line vote. Pam Bondi, a long\u8209 time Trump ally with a record of anti\u8209 LGBTQ and anti\u8209 immigrant positions, was confirmed as attorney general over civil rights groups\'92 objections. Efforts to require congressional approval for tariffs and to block Musk\'92s role in Treasury were introduced but faced long odds in a Republican\u8209 controlled legislature. Reports emerged that some representatives had been locked out of government buildings, and the attempt to remove the FEC chair while complaints against Trump were pending showed how even the formal tools of oversight could be turned against their users. Yet there were also signs of renewal. Ken Martin and David Hogg were elected to leadership roles in the Democratic National Committee, promising to rebuild party infrastructure and connect with younger and working\u8209 class voters.\
\
Public protest filled some of the space left by institutional constraint. Thousands gathered near the Capitol to denounce Musk\'92s access to taxpayer data and Trump\'92s broader agenda, joined by more than two dozen Democratic members of Congress. Crowds assembled outside the Treasury Department to object to DOGE\'92s control over payment systems. In North Carolina, activists organized demonstrations at Senator Thom Tillis\'92s office to oppose cabinet nominees like Russell Vought. Across the country, calls to Senate offices surged as news of Musk\'92s role and the Gaza proposal spread. Even some groups that had once supported Trump shifted. \'93Arab Americans for Trump\'94 rebranded as \'93Arab Americans for Peace\'94 after the Gaza announcement, signaling a break over foreign policy. These actions did not stop the week\'92s executive orders, but they showed that the moral floor of public life had not yet collapsed, even as it cracked.\
\
Looking ahead from the vantage of Week 3, several decisions already in motion promised to test the system further. The Supreme Court\'92s consideration of the nondelegation doctrine threatened to reshape the balance between Congress and regulatory agencies. The lawsuits over DOGE\'92s access to federal databases and payment systems, and over USAID\'92s dismantling, would determine whether private actors could remain embedded in the state\'92s core functions. The Gaza plan, sanctions on the International Criminal Court, and the withdrawal from UN human rights bodies set the stage for sustained conflict with international law. The reinstatement of the federal death penalty, the expansion of migrant detention at Guantanamo, and the dismantling of foreign influence and anti\uc0\u8209 kleptocracy units raised questions about how elections would be protected from foreign money and disinformation. Each of these threads was already on the docket of courts, legislatures, or international bodies. None required speculation. They were simply the next steps in a path already chosen.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock\'92s move to 7:35 p.m. captured a simple fact. The formal architecture of American democracy still stood: courts issued injunctions, Congress held hearings and passed bills, states asserted their own laws, and citizens protested in the streets. But the internal wiring of that architecture was being rerouted. Executive power was exercised with less restraint and more reliance on emergency claims. Law was used more often as a shield for allies and a sword against opponents than as a neutral limit. Appointments and access were granted on the basis of loyalty and wealth rather than competence. Oversight bodies, from inspectors general to the FEC, were fired, sidelined, or pressured. Core state functions\'97payments, personnel records, scientific data\'97were opened to an unelected private actor whose incentives were not those of a public servant.\
\
This week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly a republic can move from tension to rupture without a single dramatic break. The purges at DOJ and the FBI, the hollowing out of the civil service, the outsourcing of financial and data power to DOGE, and the use of religion and emergency rhetoric to justify new hierarchies all point in the same direction: a more personalized, more chaotic, and less accountable form of rule. At the same time, the injunctions against the funding freeze, the birthright citizenship order, and the federal worker buyout, along with the lawsuits over USAID and DOGE, show that resistance is still possible, though increasingly reactive and reliant on courts. The moral floor, as reflected in the week\'92s events, cracked across all six principles\'97character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship\'97but did not yet give way. The official end\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 period time remains 7:35 p.m. How far the hands move from here will depend on whether the remaining guardrails are strengthened, or whether they are treated, as so much else this week was treated, as obstacles to be bypassed.\
