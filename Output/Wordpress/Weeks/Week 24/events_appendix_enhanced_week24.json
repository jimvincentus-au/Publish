Instead of consulting the Parliamentarian, Republicans allowed Graham to unilaterally determine the budgetary impact, directing the Congressional Budget Office to assume the tax cuts would continue indefinitely. This manipulation was approved by a 53-47 vote, with all Republicans in favor. The maneuver effectively sidesteps the filibuster, which would otherwise apply.",

This loss stems from a provision in the bill that would impose a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits offering abortions and receiving substantial federal funding. The bill could lead to the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in blue states, affecting over 1.1 million patients. The bill is seen as a \"backdoor abortion ban\" by Planned Parenthood and its supporters, as it targets clinics in states that have protected abortion rights.",

This legislation, pushed through Congress by Republicans, significantly reduces funding for social programs while increasing the budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to levels comparable to the U.S. Army. The act is expected to lead to more frequent mass raids by ICE, as it provides the agency with substantial resources to expand its operations, including recruitment of new agents with incentives like signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness.",
