\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 14 captures a stark equilibrium: the Democracy Clock holds at 7:51 p.m., but only because judicial and civic resistance barely counterbalances accelerating executive aggression. The administration defies court orders on deportations, misuses the Alien Enemies Act, and sweeps even U.S. citizens into a punitive immigration system while shuttering detention oversight offices. Universities face weaponized funding cuts, intrusive investigations, and ideological accreditation orders, prompting lawsuits and coordinated public resistance. Health, disability, environmental, and foreign policy are recast through loyalist restructurings and emergency declarations, from Interior\'92s fast\uc0\u8209 tracked extraction permits to State\'92s hollowed\u8209 out human\u8209 rights capacity and a Ukraine \'93final offer\'94 that trades away sovereignty. Inside the Pentagon, unsecured communications and purges erode professional norms. Yet federal courts block sanctuary\u8209 city defunding, voter proof\u8209 of\u8209 citizenship rules, union\u8209 busting, and media shutdowns, while mass protests and local voting reforms expand participation. The hour does not advance, but the guardrails visibly strain.\
