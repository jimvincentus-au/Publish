In Week 15, the pattern that had been forming since the start of the term came into sharp relief. Power moved further toward a presidency that governs by decree, backed by a justice system bent to its will, a civil service stripped of neutrality, and an information sphere reshaped to favor the regime\'92s story. The week\'92s events did not just add more orders and more controversies; they showed how many levers of the state could be pulled at once to reward allies, punish critics, and redraw the boundaries of belonging. It was a week in which citizenship, law, and truth themselves were sorted into hierarchies, and in which the tools meant to guard against abuse were turned into instruments of it.\
\
At the start of this period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:38 p.m. By the end of Week 15, it read 7:43 p.m., a movement of just over four minutes deeper into the danger zone. That shift reflects not a single spectacular break, but a dense cluster of structural changes: emergency powers used as routine policy tools, the Department of Justice recast as shield and sword for the president, the civil service reclassified for loyalty, and independent media and universities brought under direct pressure. Courts, some state officials, and mass protests did push back in places, but their gains were defensive and narrow. The net effect was to make the new order harder to unwind.\
\
The most visible strand of the week was the further normalization of rule by emergency and executive order. Trump\'92s earlier declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, used to deploy troops and hardline policies, was now joined by a national \'93energy emergency\'94 to open more land and ocean to drilling, and by a sweeping use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods. These moves bypassed Congress and treated extraordinary powers as a standing toolkit for trade, immigration, and energy. When congressional Democrats tried to claw back tariff authority, Republicans in both chambers used procedure to block votes, leaving the emergency structure intact. The presidency grew more unilateral, and the legislature more performative. That was the point.\
\
Alongside these emergencies came a flood of orders that rewrote the basic terms of citizenship and status. Trump signed and defended executive orders aimed at ending birthright citizenship for many U.S.-born children of undocumented people, freezing refugee admissions, and preparing a vast migrant detention facility at Guant\'e1namo Bay. He used the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th\uc0\u8209 century wartime law, to justify detentions and deportations of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members, and he publicly embraced that use as a model. Courts did intervene: the Supreme Court blocked the deportation of a Venezuelan teenager, Javier Salazar, and a federal judge in Texas ruled that the Alien Enemies Act could not be stretched to cover such cases in peacetime. But the administration\'92s willingness to test and defy legal limits showed that, in practice, law was being treated as a weapon to be pushed until it broke. Limits held, but only where judges moved fast and were willing to confront the White House.\
\
The same logic appeared in the way federal power was turned against disfavored states and institutions. Sanctuary cities and states that resisted federal immigration demands were targeted by an order to list and punish them, with threats to cut off funds. Maine saw its child nutrition funds frozen when it refused to bar transgender girls from girls\'92 sports, and only a negotiated settlement restored the money. Michigan and Hawaii were sued by the Department of Justice to stop their climate lawsuits against oil companies, and Puerto Rico dropped its own climate case under pressure. Universities that resisted federal dictates on speech and diversity, such as Harvard and Chicago\'92s public schools, were threatened with the loss of billions in funding or subjected to civil-rights investigations. Federal power, once meant to equalize protection, was now used to discipline. It was a clear warning to any jurisdiction that stepped out of line.\
\
The Department of Justice sat at the center of this transformation. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, DOJ created a \'93weaponization working group\'94 whose very purpose was to frame investigations into Trump\'92s past conduct as partisan attacks. It closed its cryptocurrency enforcement unit after complaints from industry allies, paused prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for six months, and dropped investigations and lawsuits against 89 corporations, many of them donors. At the same time, it opened a politically charged investigation into ActBlue, the Democrats\'92 main online fundraising platform, on unproven allegations of foreign money, and pursued law firms that had successfully sued Fox News over election lies. The message was plain: enforcement would fall on opponents and inconvenient industries, while friends would see their liabilities erased. Law was no longer a neutral limit; it was a tool of selection.\
\
The president\'92s pardon power was folded into this pattern. In addition to the earlier mass pardons for January 6 defendants, which directed DOJ to dismiss remaining cases and signaled tolerance for political violence in service of the regime, new pardons wiped out more than a billion dollars in restitution owed by white\uc0\u8209 collar offenders. Figures convicted of fraud and embezzlement saw their debts to victims vanish; a cryptocurrency exchange had a $100 million fine erased. These acts did not just free individuals; they rewrote the financial consequences of elite crime. Combined with the halt in FCPA prosecutions and the closure of the crypto unit, they told a donor class that legal risk could be managed politically. Accountability became negotiable for those with the right ties.\
\
Beneath these headline moves, the neutral machinery of government was being hollowed out and repurposed. The Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk, continued its ideological purge of agencies under the guise of cost savings, even as its own program was projected to cost more than it saved. DOGE operatives with little experience were embedded in departments like HUD, where a college student used AI tools to scan and propose rewrites of regulations. At the National Park Service, a planned \'93reduction in force\'94 threatened to cut thousands of positions, adding to earlier losses. The Peace Corps offered buyouts to staff as part of a DOGE-driven restructuring. And in April, Trump signed an order reclassifying tens of thousands of civil service roles as political appointments, reviving and expanding the old \'93Schedule F\'94 concept. Together, these steps turned a professional bureaucracy into a patronage system and opened core state functions to private contractors and corporate partners. Neutral capacity gave way to loyal capacity.\
\
Nowhere was this fusion of business and governance clearer than in the realm of money and access. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump took stakes in an AI company poised to benefit from deregulation. The family and a major donor launched the \'93Executive Branch\'94 club in Georgetown, where a half\uc0\u8209 million\u8209 dollar membership fee bought proximity to cabinet members and senior advisers. The president himself promoted a $TRUMP cryptocurrency contest in which the largest holders would be invited to dinner and a VIP White House tour, even as he profited from transaction fees and price spikes. Senators asked the Office of Government Ethics to investigate these schemes as potential bribery and emoluments violations, but the administration pressed ahead. Policy outcomes\'97from tariff design to deregulation\'97were increasingly hard to separate from the financial interests of those closest to power. Crony capitalism and governance were becoming the same thing.\
\
The economic consequences of this model were already visible. Sweeping tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, Canada, and beyond, combined with \'93reciprocal tariffs\'94 of up to 49% on all goods, drove capital flight and raised borrowing costs for the U.S. government. Factory orders and shipments fell; manufacturers delayed investment; ports projected a 35% drop in shipping volumes. UPS announced layoffs of 20,000 workers and the closure of 73 facilities, citing tariff\uc0\u8209 driven declines in volume. Tesla raised prices in Canada, depressing demand. Tourism from overseas dropped sharply as deportations and trade wars made the United States seem hostile and expensive. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.3% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2025, the first in three years. Yet the White House insisted that tariffs were not to blame, and Trump publicly claimed any downturn was Biden\'92s fault. Economic data became another field to be spun.\
\
While the economic floor sagged, protections for workers and the poor were chipped away. Republicans advanced work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP, despite evidence that most recipients already work or cannot. Trump acknowledged that the $7.25 federal minimum wage was \'93very low\'94 but took no steps to raise it, instead proposing to end federal taxation on tips\'97a move that would do little for the lowest\uc0\u8209 paid workers and might encourage employers to rely more on tips and less on wages. The administration withdrew a salmonella safety rule for poultry after industry lobbying, exposing consumers to greater risk. Disaster relief policy was rewritten to shift more of the financial burden onto states, with the threat that non\u8209 compliant states\'97especially on immigration\'97could see funds withheld. Inequality was not an accident of these choices; it was their logic. Risk moved down the ladder, while gains stayed at the top.\
\
Civil rights and the basic terms of membership in the political community were also reordered. Immigration enforcement grew harsher and more arbitrary. ICE deported U.S. citizen children with serious illnesses alongside their undocumented mothers, sometimes without medication or medical consultation. Mothers and citizen toddlers were sent to Honduras after routine check\uc0\u8209 ins, without a chance to arrange custody or speak to lawyers. ICE resumed data\u8209 sharing with the Office of Refugee Resettlement to target unaccompanied children and their sponsors for deportation or prosecution, turning \'93welfare checks\'94 into intelligence\u8209 gathering. A green\u8209 card holder from Ireland was detained over a decades\u8209 old conviction she believed expunged. A Venezuelan migrant, Neiyerver Rengel, disappeared into a chain of detention and deportation to El Salvador, with his family left in the dark. In Oklahoma City, ICE agents raided the home of a U.S. citizen family by mistake, seizing phones and savings. These were not isolated errors; they were the predictable outcomes of a system that treated certain people as expendable.\
\
At the same time, the administration moved to stratify citizenship and rights by origin, religion, and identity. The birthright\uc0\u8209 citizenship order, though blocked, signaled an intent to narrow the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s guarantee. Refugee policy was frozen, with only case\u8209 by\u8209 case admissions allowed in the \'93national interest,\'94 while the administration considered special relief for Christian Afghan refugees after revoking their status, under pressure from religious leaders. English was declared the official language of the United States, and commercial drivers were required by order to read and speak English, measures that would fall hardest on immigrants. Executive orders ended federal benefits for undocumented immigrants and barred government and nonprofit employees from student loan forgiveness if they engaged in \'93improper activities\'94 tied to immigration or terrorism. Transgender minors saw their access to gender\u8209 affirming care cut off under federal programs, and transgender athletes were banned from women\'92s sports. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs were terminated across the government. Citizenship, in practice, was being sorted into tiers.\
\
Religion played a growing role in legitimizing this hierarchy. Trump hosted a National Prayer Day event in the Rose Garden, declaring that America must be \'93One Nation Under God\'94 and touting a White House Faith Office that operated from within the executive mansion. He signed an order to eliminate \'93anti\uc0\u8209 Christian bias\'94 in government and created a Religious Liberty Commission, populated by presidential appointees, to advise on policy and recommend further actions. In Oklahoma, a new social studies curriculum, crafted with heavy input from Christian nationalist activists, dramatically increased references to the Bible and Christian influence while omitting the separation of church and state. At the same time, the Kennedy Center\'92s Trump\u8209 appointed board canceled World Pride events, and the Pentagon\'92s Women, Peace and Security program was dismantled as \'93woke.\'94 Religion, in this configuration, was not a private matter; it was a tool of statecraft.\
\
The information environment was reshaped to match. Public broadcasting came under direct assault: Trump signed an order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and executive agencies to cut off funding to NPR and PBS, accusing them of bias, while a Project 2025\'96aligned FCC chair opened investigations that could further defund them. DOJ rescinded policies that had protected journalists from being forced to reveal sources, and Bondi\'92s department signaled a willingness to jail reporters for contempt. The White House barred the Associated Press from Oval Office events and the presidential pool, even after a court ruling in AP\'92s favor. At the same time, the administration launched \'93White House Wire,\'94 a news\uc0\u8209 style site on official servers that aggregated favorable coverage and official statements, and it held alternative press briefings with right\u8209 wing influencers who echoed its narratives. The goal was not just to attack hostile media, but to build a state\u8209 aligned alternative.\
\
Education and public memory were pulled into the same orbit. The Department of Education opened an investigation into Chicago\'92s Black Student Success Plan after a complaint that it discriminated by race, threatening federal funds. It also began dismantling the department itself by executive order, seeking to sidestep Congress. In Oklahoma, Superintendent Ryan Walters pushed through a 400\uc0\u8209 page social studies curriculum that embedded debunked claims of 2020 election fraud and other pro\u8209 Trump narratives, sending last\u8209 minute revisions to the state board just hours before a vote and falsely claiming a legislative deadline to force approval. The curriculum\'92s Christian emphasis and conspiratorial content were not incidental; they were the point. At the federal level, the administration fired Doug Emhoff and other Biden\u8209 era appointees from the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, replacing them with allies. Statutes, schools, and museums\'97the institutions that carry a nation\'92s memory\'97were being curated by power.\
\
Against this tide, there were pockets of resistance. Harvard University refused to accept federal demands to reshape its governance and admissions in exchange for funding, and then sued over threats to cut $9 billion in support. A federal judge ordered the administration to restore funds to Radio Free Europe, ruling that the executive could not simply refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress. Another judge in Vermont ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student detained for deportation, finding that his continued detention would chill protected speech. A federal appeals court upheld an injunction blocking DOGE from accessing Social Security records, and later refused to lift a block on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in Colorado. In Texas, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. permanently barred the use of that law to deport Venezuelans in his district, and the Supreme Court stepped in to protect individual migrants from immediate removal. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, speaking in Puerto Rico, condemned the administration\'92s rhetoric as designed to intimidate the judiciary. These were real checks, but they were scattered, and they did not stop the broader reconfiguration.\
\
Civil society, too, stirred. Millions had already marched in \'93Hands Off!\'94 protests earlier in April, and this week saw Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Cory Booker hold a 12\uc0\u8209 hour sit\u8209 in on the Capitol steps against Republican budget cuts. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker called for mass protests and a more aggressive defense of due process and public services. Conservative Catholics mobilized to influence the coming papal conclave, while a fire at Memphis\'92s Clayborn Temple, a civil\u8209 rights landmark, reminded communities of the fragility of physical memory. On campuses, students protesting Israeli policies faced suspensions, derecognition of groups, and FBI raids on their homes. The right to protest formally remained, but the costs of exercising it rose.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 15, several processes were already in motion. The Religious Liberty Commission and White House Faith Office would begin issuing recommendations. The FCC\'92s investigations into NPR and PBS, and the administration\'92s order to cut their funding, would move through legal and administrative channels. DOGE\'92s attempt to gain access to Social Security records was before the Supreme Court on emergency appeal. The Senate was preparing to consider nominees like Russ Vought at OMB and Rodney Scott at CBP, whose views on executive power and enforcement would shape the next phase. State climate lawsuits faced active DOJ efforts to shut them down. And in classrooms, the new Oklahoma curriculum was set to take effect in the 2025\'9626 school year unless reversed.\
\
By the close of Week 15, with the clock at 7:43 p.m., the story of Trump\'92s second term had entered a new phase. The early months had shown a preference for executive action and a disdain for constraints; this week showed how far that preference could be carried when backed by a reengineered justice system, a politicized civil service, and a curated information order. Law was less a boundary than a set of tools to be repurposed. Citizenship and rights were less universal than contingent on origin, identity, and loyalty. Independent institutions\'97from courts to universities to public broadcasters\'97still stood, but they were under sustained pressure, and their victories were narrow. The movement of the Democracy Clock captures this shift: not a sudden lurch, but a steady tightening of the frame within which democracy must now struggle to breathe.\
