\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 4 of Trump\'92s second term marks a shift from improvisation to architecture. The U.S. Digital Service is repurposed into Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency, a parallel command structure empowered to fire, freeze, and rewire agencies from USAID to NIH. Mass layoffs, buyouts, and the abolition of training institutes hollow the civil service while loyalty appointments at OMB, HHS, and DNI consolidate ideological control. The Justice Department drops a detailed corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams and halts probes into Musk\'92s companies, even as Trump suspends enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and pardons Rod Blagojevich, turning law into a shield for allies. In parallel, DEI and health content vanish from thousands of federal pages, Pentagon schools pull books, Stonewall\'92s trans history is erased, and AP reporters are banned from core presidential spaces. Courts repeatedly block funding freezes, citizenship changes, and agency shutdowns, and civil society mobilizes in streets, lawsuits, and phone lines. The Democracy Clock stays at 7:40 p.m., but an internal advance of 0.3 minutes captures the tightening grip of an executive willing to act first and dare institutions to keep up.\
