In Week 41 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock edged from 11:24 to 11:25 p.m., a modest numerical shift that belies a dense structural turn. The federal government entered its fourth week of shutdown, with food assistance imperiled and workers unpaid, even as the East Wing of the White House was demolished for a donor-funded ballroom bearing the president’s imprint. Corporations and foreign investors financed monuments and crypto ventures that intertwined public power with private enrichment. Law enforcement and the Justice Department targeted critics and former investigators while pardons and claims for compensation insulated allies and family businesses. Immigration and security policy hardened into a hierarchy of belonging, with militarized raids, secret detention, and visa revocations aimed at dissenters and marginalized communities. Legislatures drifted into performance, emergency powers normalized, and agencies were hollowed or captured. Courts, states, and civil society mounted notable resistance—especially around SNAP benefits and voting rules—but their victories felt embattled, not routine.
