\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 38 Appendix: Law as Domestic Force\
\
This week shows an executive openly testing the outer limits of unchecked power while key guardrails strain but do not break. The Trump administration escalated domestic militarization\'97federalizing and cross-deploying National Guard units over state objections, floating Insurrection Act use, and justifying lethal force against drug boats\'97directly pressuring separation of powers, civil\'96military norms, and protest rights. Simultaneously, the Justice Department was aggressively weaponized: politically aligned prosecutors indicted Letitia James and James Comey, corruption probes were buried, and elite allies shielded, even as 282 former DOJ officials warned of institutional destruction. Congress remained largely performative, paralyzed by a shutdown that is being used to slash programs, punish Democratic jurisdictions, and threaten federal workers\'92 back pay. Information and public health systems were bent toward disinformation, especially around vaccines, while transparency over the Epstein files and other sensitive matters was actively obstructed. Courts provided some counterweight\'97blocking several Guard deployments and protecting journalists and protesters\'97but also enabled abuses in immigration detention and signaled potential retrenchment on LGBTQ+ and voting rights. Overall, structural pressure strongly worsened rule-of-law integrity, federalism, and the independence of law enforcement and administration.\
