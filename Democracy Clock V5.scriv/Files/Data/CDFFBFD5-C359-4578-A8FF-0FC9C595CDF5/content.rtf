\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 5 Appendix: The Neutral State Emptied Out\
\
This week reads like a concentrated blueprint for competitive authoritarianism. The Trump\'96Musk DOGE project accelerates into a full-spectrum assault on the neutral state: mass firings across health, environment, safety, foreign aid, and land agencies; cancellation of collective bargaining; and court rulings that green\uc0\u8209 light purges entrench a politicized, hollowed\u8209 out civil service. Simultaneously, executive orders and new doctrines centralize control over independent regulators, inspectors general, and the Justice Department, while loyalists like Kash Patel and Ed Martin are installed to redirect law enforcement toward regime priorities and away from elite allies. Information control and cultural engineering intensify: AP is banned and sues, DoD schools and federal websites are scrubbed of DEI and LGBTQ and Black history content, and symbolic moves like renaming the Gulf of Mexico and seizing the Kennedy Center signal a bid to curate national memory. Abroad, the administration edges toward a pro\u8209 Kremlin realignment, pressuring Ukraine to trade sovereignty for minerals and sidelining NATO. Courts and Congress still throw up pockets of resistance\'97blocking the birthright\u8209 citizenship ban, protecting some diversity staff, and probing DOGE\'92s data grabs\'97but the structural pressure this week is overwhelmingly toward entrenched personalist rule.\
\
Week 5 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump signed an executive order empowering Elon Musk\'92s DOGE committee to shrink the federal workforce (2025-02-11): By delegating sweeping workforce reduction authority to a non\uc0\u8209 statutory committee led by a private actor, the president concentrated executive power outside normal channels and weakened protections for neutral public administration.\
\
2. President Trump implemented and defended an illegal federal spending freeze (2025-02-16): Freezing congressionally appropriated funds in defiance of statutory obligations undermined legislative control of the purse and signaled willingness to ignore budget law to advance executive priorities.\
\
3. President Trump ordered mass firings of federal workers across multiple agencies (2025-02-21): Large\uc0\u8209 scale dismissals of probationary and other federal employees, often without regard to role or performance, weakened state capacity and signaled that civil service tenure depends on political favor.\
\
4. President Trump directed the Justice Department to fire remaining Biden\uc0\u8209 appointed US attorneys (2025-02-19): Purging prior\u8209 administration US attorneys en masse tightened presidential control over federal prosecutions and reduced institutional checks on politicized charging decisions.\
\
5. President Trump issued executive orders to centralize oversight of independent regulatory agencies under the White House (2025-02-18): Requiring independent regulators to route rules and priorities through OIRA and the White House eroded their statutory independence and expanded direct presidential control over regulation.\
\
6. President Trump signed deregulatory executive orders instructing agencies to rescind or ignore rules deemed unconstitutional or beyond statutory authority (2025-02-19): Telling agencies to unilaterally downgrade enforcement of disfavored regulations invited the executive branch to reinterpret law for itself, weakening legislative supremacy and judicial review.\
\
7. President Trump issued an order to reduce federal bureaucracy and shrink or terminate several public entities (2025-02-19): Targeting public institutions like the African Development Foundation and Institute of Peace for downsizing or elimination shifted resources away from public goods toward a leaner, more centralized executive apparatus.\
\
8. President Trump announced plans to disband the USPS governing board and place the Postal Service under the Commerce Secretary (2025-02-20): Moving to dissolve USPS\'92s independent board and fold it into a cabinet department threatened the service\'92s quasi\uc0\u8209 independent status and increased scope for politicized control of a core civic infrastructure.\
\
9. President Trump suggested publicly that he might run for a third presidential term (2025-02-20): Floating the idea of a third term and questioning constitutional limits normalized discussion of extending personal rule beyond the two\uc0\u8209 term safeguard.\
\
10. Steve Bannon and allied activists promoted a constitutional change at CPAC to allow Trump a third term (2025-02-20): Organized advocacy to amend presidential term limits moved the notion of extended incumbency from rhetoric toward a concrete political project.\
\
11. President Trump signed executive orders reshaping NIH and cutting climate\uc0\u8209 related and diversity\u8209 related research funding (2025-02-20): Using executive power to freeze grants, fire staff, and bar certain research topics at NIH and in climate science redirected federal science toward political priorities and away from independent inquiry.\
\
12. President Trump signed executive orders declaring an energy emergency and fast\uc0\u8209 tracking fossil fuel projects (2025-02-19): Invoking an \'93energy emergency\'94 to accelerate hundreds of fossil fuel permits allowed the executive to bypass normal environmental review and public input in favor of rapid extraction.\
\
13. President Trump announced plans and took steps toward abolishing the Department of Education (2025-02-19): Calling for immediate closure of the Education Department and preparing an order to dismantle it threatened federal support for low\uc0\u8209 income and disabled students and removed a national counterweight in education policy.\
\
14. President Trump issued executive orders ending or restricting federal benefits for undocumented immigrants (2025-02-19): Directing agencies to cut off benefits and enforce eligibility checks against undocumented residents used federal spending to harden a tiered system of rights based on immigration status.\
\
15. President Trump threatened to cut federal funding to Maine over compliance with a transgender sports ban (2025-02-21): Using the prospect of withholding federal funds to coerce a state into adopting contested social policy pressured state autonomy and targeted transgender participation in public life.\
\
16. President Trump denied Georgia\'92s request to extend the deadline for federal disaster assistance applications after Hurricane Helene (2025-02-15): Refusing to extend a disaster aid deadline for a hard\uc0\u8209 hit state signaled willingness to use federal relief discretion in ways that can penalize disfavored jurisdictions and communities.\
\
17. President Trump issued an executive order ending federal support for school COVID\uc0\u8209 19 vaccine mandates (2025-02-15): Barring discretionary federal funds from supporting schools with COVID\u8209 19 vaccine requirements shifted public\u8209 health decision\u8209 making toward parental and religious claims and away from expert guidance.\
\
18. President Trump signed a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and declaring Gulf of America Day (2025-02-09): Unilaterally renaming a major body of water and tying media access to use of the new term used symbolic power to enforce a preferred national narrative over geographic convention.\
\
19. President Trump ordered the cancellation of collective bargaining agreements and rescinded protections for federal workers and contractors (2025-02-18): Unilaterally voiding labor agreements and rolling back contractor protections weakened organized labor within the federal workforce and increased executive leverage over employment conditions.\
\
20. President Trump oversaw mistaken firings and partial reversals of critical national security staff (2025-02-16): Erroneous dismissals of NNSA and bird\uc0\u8209 flu response staff, followed by hurried reversals, showed how politicized purges can inadvertently degrade core safety and security functions.\
\
21. President Trump directed the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams (2025-02-17): Ordering prosecutors to abandon a high\uc0\u8209 profile corruption case in exchange for policy cooperation blurred the line between legal judgment and political bargaining.\
\
22. President Trump pardoned and publicly celebrated January 6 Capitol attackers (2025-02-20): Granting clemency to and honoring individuals convicted for attacking the transfer of power signaled tolerance for political violence carried out on behalf of the incumbent.\
\
23. President Trump ordered the US Marshals Service to deputize Elon Musk\'92s private security guards (2025-02-20): Empowering a private security detail to act as armed federal officers on government property blurred boundaries between public law enforcement and private loyalty to a presidential ally.\
\
24. President Trump removed Joint Chiefs Chair CQ Brown Jr. and other top military officials (2025-02-21): Firing senior military leaders, reportedly over their support for diversity initiatives, politicized command appointments and risked aligning the armed forces more closely with ideological preferences.\
\
25. President Trump reassigned ICE leadership to increase arrests and deportations (2025-02-21): Shuffling ICE\'92s top officials to accelerate removals emphasized numerical enforcement targets over due\uc0\u8209 process concerns and reinforced a hard\u8209 line approach to immigration.\
\
26. President Trump announced a plan to abolish the Department of Education and disparaged it as a con job (2025-02-16): Calling for immediate closure of the Education Department and delegitimizing its mission framed federal support for equal educational opportunity as expendable.\
\
27. President Trump signed an executive order expanding access to in vitro fertilization (2025-02-18): Directing policy work to lower IVF costs and protect access modestly expanded reproductive options, though without immediate binding changes to coverage or funding.\
\
28. President Trump signed an executive order to end COVID\uc0\u8209 19 vaccine mandates in schools tied to federal funding (2025-02-15): Conditioning federal education funds on the absence of vaccine mandates shifted school health policy toward political and parental pressures rather than public\u8209 health standards.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Federal courts and the Trump administration clashed over executive defiance of orders restoring funding and halting certain policies (2025-02-16): The administration\'92s refusal to comply with multiple federal court orders on funding freezes and other actions strained separation of powers and raised the risk that judicial checks would be ignored in practice.\
\
2. DC Circuit Court of Appeals refused to hear Trump\'92s appeal seeking to fire Hampton Dellinger (2025-02-15): By leaving in place an injunction protecting the head of the Office of Special Counsel, the court temporarily preserved an independent whistleblower watchdog from politically motivated removal.\
\
3. Trump administration Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court to uphold firing of the Office of Special Counsel head (2025-02-17): Seeking high\uc0\u8209 court approval to dismiss the whistleblower\u8209 protection chief framed independent oversight as an impermissible constraint on presidential authority.\
\
4. Federal courts allowed the Trump administration to proceed with mass federal worker firings and USAID furloughs (2025-02-21): Judicial refusals to block large\uc0\u8209 scale layoffs and furloughs at USAID and other agencies enabled rapid restructuring of the civil service despite union objections.\
\
5. Federal appeals courts denied emergency requests to reinstate Trump\'92s birthright citizenship ban (2025-02-21): By keeping injunctions against an executive order ending birthright citizenship in place, appellate courts upheld Fourteenth Amendment protections for children of non\uc0\u8209 citizens.\
\
6. Federal judge in Missouri struck down a discriminatory licensing requirement for abortion providers (2025-02-15): Invalidating special licensing rules that singled out abortion clinics enforced Missouri\'92s new constitutional protection for abortion and restored access to services.\
\
7. Federal judge temporarily blocked firing of diversity staffers at CIA and ODNI (2025-02-18): Protecting DEI staff from immediate dismissal preserved some internal capacity for diversity initiatives while the legality of the purge is litigated.\
\
8. Federal judge declined to block DOGE access to Education Department data systems (2025-02-17): Allowing DOGE to proceed with accessing sensitive education data endorsed expanded executive reach into agency information systems despite privacy concerns.\
\
9. Federal courts issued mixed rulings on DOGE\uc0\u8209 related workforce and data actions (2025-02-19): Courts upheld Musk\'92s voluntary buyout plan for federal workers and declined to halt mass firings, while unions and states continued to challenge DOGE\'92s legality, reflecting contested but often permissive judicial oversight.\
\
10. Justice Department leadership pressured and confined Public Integrity lawyers to choose who would dismiss the Eric Adams indictment (2025-02-14): Forcing career prosecutors to pick a colleague to withdraw a corruption case or face firing exemplified direct political coercion inside DOJ and undermined prosecutorial independence.\
\
11. Public Integrity Section lawyers and SDNY leadership resigned in protest over orders to drop charges against Mayor Eric Adams (2025-02-14): Multiple resignations, including the acting US attorney, signaled internal resistance to perceived political interference in corruption prosecutions but also depleted institutional capacity to resist future pressure.\
\
12. Federal judge Dale E Ho questioned DOJ\'92s motion to dismiss the Eric Adams indictment on policy grounds (2025-02-19): Judicial scrutiny of DOJ\'92s rationale for dropping the Adams case highlighted concern that prosecutorial discretion was being used to serve political bargains rather than legal merits.\
\
13. Federal courts handled climate\uc0\u8209 related lawsuits challenging Trump environmental rollbacks (2025-02-19): New suits and notices of intent to sue over offshore drilling and expedited permits positioned the judiciary as a key arena for contesting executive climate deregulation.\
\
14. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission moved to dismiss gender\uc0\u8209 identity discrimination cases citing a binary\u8209 sex executive order (2025-02-16): Abandoning pending cases involving transgender workers reoriented federal civil\u8209 rights enforcement away from protecting gender\u8209 identity claims and toward a narrower reading aligned with executive policy.\
\
15. House Budget Committee and allied Republicans advanced budget blueprints with deep cuts to social programs and extended tax breaks (2025-02-16): Proposed budgets that slash Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition aid and other safety\uc0\u8209 net programs while extending high\u8209 end tax cuts would structurally shift resources away from vulnerable populations.\
\
16. Congressional Democrats and allied officials coordinated legal, legislative, and protest responses to Trump and Musk\'92s dismantling of federal structures (2025-02-17): By organizing lawsuits, oversight efforts, and demonstrations, opposition actors sought to use remaining institutional tools to slow or reverse executive\uc0\u8209 driven deconstruction of the administrative state.\
\
17. North Carolina legislature advanced SB 58 to limit the state attorney general\'92s power to challenge presidential actions (2025-02-19): Restricting the attorney general\'92s authority to litigate against illegal or unconstitutional federal acts would weaken a key state\uc0\u8209 level check on national executive overreach.\
\
18. Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren demanded information from the IRS about DOGE\'92s access to taxpayer data (2025-02-17): Senate oversight letters pressed the IRS to explain and justify DOGE\'92s reach into sensitive tax systems, highlighting congressional concern over potential politicization of data access.\
\
19. Congress previously enacted a law requiring Senate approval for any presidential withdrawal from NATO (2023-12-01): Statutory limits on unilateral NATO withdrawal bolstered legislative control over alliance commitments and constrained future presidents from exiting without broad consent.\
\
20. Federal Election Commission scheduled a closed Sunshine Act meeting on enforcement and litigation matters (2025-02-25): The FEC\'92s planned closed meeting on compliance and civil actions reflected ongoing, if opaque, enforcement of campaign\uc0\u8209 finance and election laws.\
\
21. National Archives and FOIA Advisory Committee announced a public FOIA advisory meeting (2025-02-18): A scheduled FOIA advisory meeting with public participation supported continued refinement of transparency practices and open\uc0\u8209 records policy.\
\
22. Joshua Fisher, Director of the Office of Administration told a court that Elon Musk is only a senior advisor without formal decision authority (2025-02-19): Characterizing Musk as an informal advisor in litigation sought to shield his extensive operational role from constitutional scrutiny and Senate confirmation requirements.\
\
23. Senate Republicans and President Trump clashed over competing budget strategies amid shutdown risk (2025-02-15): Trump\'92s endorsement of a House budget over the Senate plan complicated negotiations and increased the risk of a shutdown, using fiscal brinkmanship as leverage over Congress.\
\
24. Federal and state actors pursued and defended climate superfund laws and related litigation (2025-02-18): States like New York and Vermont advanced climate superfund statutes while red states and industry sued to block them, testing federalism boundaries in environmental accountability.\
\
25. Federal judiciary handled high\uc0\u8209 profile criminal and civil cases involving Luigi Mangione and IVF disputes (2025-02-21): Ongoing murder, terrorism, and IVF\u8209 related malpractice cases illustrated the courts\'92 role in adjudicating severe criminal liability and emerging bioethical conflicts.\
\
\
Economic Structure\
\
1. Trump administration moved to impose new tariffs despite inflation and trade\uc0\u8209 war risks (2025-02-16): Preparing additional tariffs risked retaliatory trade measures and job losses, using trade policy as a blunt instrument with broad economic consequences.\
\
2. Trump administration froze funding for EV subsidies and CHIPS Act implementation (2025-02-20): Halting congressionally approved support for electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing undercut industrial policy aimed at technological competitiveness and climate goals.\
\
3. Trump administration and DOGE canceled or misrepresented billions in federal contracts as waste reductions (2025-02-19): Inflated claims about canceling $16 billion in contracts, including a misvalued $8 billion item, obscured the real fiscal impact of DOGE\'92s cuts and complicated accountability for procurement decisions.\
\
4. Trump administration proposed deep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food assistance (2025-02-21): Plans to reduce core entitlement and nutrition programs would shift economic risk onto older, disabled, and low\uc0\u8209 income Americans while preserving advantages for wealthier groups.\
\
5. House Republicans and President Trump advanced and endorsed budget resolutions mandating large cuts to Medicaid and other safety\uc0\u8209 net programs (2025-02-19): Budget targets that effectively require slashing Medicaid and related programs would narrow access to healthcare and education for vulnerable populations.\
\
6. Department of Government Efficiency and allied officials implemented budget cuts causing mass federal job losses, including in Alaska (2025-02-20): DOGE\uc0\u8209 driven cuts that eliminated many federal positions, while some lawmakers claimed powerlessness, shifted economic pain onto local communities and weakened public\u8209 sector employment.\
\
7. Elon Musk called for defunding the International Space Station after disputes over astronaut returns (2025-02-19): Advocating to cut ISS funding amid a commercial\uc0\u8209 government dispute highlighted tensions between private space firms and publicly funded international research infrastructure.\
\
8. Trump administration moved to revoke federal approval for New York City\'92s congestion pricing program (2025-02-19): Intervening to block a local congestion\uc0\u8209 pricing scheme undermined a city\'92s chosen tool for managing traffic and pollution and signaled federal hostility to urban environmental finance innovations.\
\
9. Elon Musk\'92s DOGE and allied agencies sought and defended access to IRS and SSA taxpayer and beneficiary data systems (2025-02-17): Efforts to obtain detailed tax and Social Security records for \'93efficiency\'94 reviews concentrated sensitive economic data under a politically aligned unit, raising risks of targeted enforcement or favoritism.\
\
10. USDA and FDA leadership fired staff reviewing Elon Musk\'92s Neuralink and other regulated technologies (2025-02-17): Removing regulators overseeing Neuralink and related devices weakened independent scrutiny of a politically connected company\'92s products and suggested regulatory capture.\
\
11. SpaceX and FAA officials conducted a review visit to the FAA command center overseeing air traffic control (2025-02-17): Allowing a regulated launch provider to review core FAA systems raised conflict\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 interest concerns about industry influence over safety and regulatory decisions.\
\
12. Trump administration moved to fast\uc0\u8209 track fossil fuel permits through the Army Corps of Engineers (2025-02-20): Creating an emergency permit track for hundreds of fossil projects prioritized rapid development over environmental review, benefiting energy interests while externalizing ecological costs.\
\
13. Elon Musk and DOGE claimed large savings from canceling federal contracts that were later debunked (2025-02-19): Overstated reports of contract cancellations distorted public understanding of fiscal policy and masked the real distributional effects of DOGE\'92s cuts.\
\
14. University of Michigan survey researchers reported a sharp drop in consumer confidence linked to tariff concerns (2025-02-20): Falling consumer sentiment in response to tariff policy signaled public anxiety about economic management and potential demand\uc0\u8209 side weakness.\
\
15. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered Pentagon leaders to plan for an 8% defense budget cut over five years (2025-02-20): Directing substantial defense reductions while publicly backing higher spending created uncertainty about long\uc0\u8209 term military capacity and industrial planning.\
\
16. Trump administration proposed repealing tariffs on China in exchange for purchase commitments (2025-02-20): Considering removal of China tariffs for promised purchases risked repeating past deals where commitments were not met, potentially advantaging Chinese producers without durable gains for US workers.\
\
17. Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered Ukraine support in exchange for half its mineral resources (2025-02-12): Linking wartime assistance to a demand for 50% of Ukraine\'92s mineral wealth fused foreign policy with extractive economic interests and raised concerns about economic colonialism.\
\
18. Trump Media & Technology Group reported large financial losses and minimal revenue (2025-02-15): Continuing heavy losses at Trump\'92s media company underscored the financial fragility of a partisan platform closely tied to a political figure.\
\
19. Tesla sued Chinese car owners, bloggers, and media over complaints and criticism (2025-02-15): Aggressive defamation and consumer suits in China, where Tesla wins most cases, illustrated how corporate actors can leverage authoritarian legal systems to silence critics.\
\
20. Drug Enforcement Administration and multiple pharmaceutical firms processed applications to manufacture or import controlled substances for research and commerce (2025-02-18): DEA notices on bulk manufacturing and import of controlled substances like psilocybin, MDMA, and opioids reflected ongoing regulation of lucrative and sensitive drug markets.\
\
21. Occupational Safety and Health Administration extended approval for MDA construction safety information collection (2025-02-18): Renewing data collection on hazardous chemical exposure in construction maintained regulatory oversight of workplace health risks.\
\

\

\
24. Environmental Protection Agency withdrew a direct final rule on Utah\'92s hazardous waste program and extended comment periods on PFAS and sludge assessments (2025-02-21): Adjusting rulemaking timelines and responding to comments preserved opportunities for public input on hazardous waste and water\uc0\u8209 quality standards.\
\
25. Federal Communications Commission finalized rules improving accessibility of video programming interfaces (2025-02-21): Requiring easy access to closed\uc0\u8209 caption settings expanded media accessibility for deaf and hard\u8209 of\u8209 hearing viewers, modestly broadening inclusive participation in information flows.\
\
\
Civil Rights and Dissent\
\
1. Trump administration threatened and moved to end legal protections and benefits for Ukrainians and other TPS holders (2025-02-15): Pausing U4U decisions and reviewing TPS for 17 countries injected uncertainty into the legal status of hundreds of thousands of residents, weakening protections for refugees and migrants.\
\
2. Trump administration cut and then restored legal aid for unaccompanied immigrant children (2025-02-18): Briefly stripping legal representation from unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings exposed a highly vulnerable group to navigating complex courts without counsel.\
\
3. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump detained immigrants at courthouses and mandatory check\uc0\u8209 ins, including DACA recipients (2025-02-18): Arresting people as they complied with legal obligations at courts and check\u8209 ins blurred lines between civil process and enforcement, discouraging participation in the justice system.\
\
4. Department of Justice fired more than two dozen immigration judges and candidates amid a case backlog (2025-02-15): Removing immigration judges and new hires during a heavy caseload risked longer detentions and slower adjudication for migrants seeking legal resolution.\
\
5. Trump administration and DOGE pursued mass firings and furloughs of veterans and public\uc0\u8209 health workers during disease outbreaks (2025-02-21): Laying off veterans and health staff at agencies like USDA, CDC, VA, and FAA during crises weakened services for vulnerable groups and reduced capacity to manage emergencies.\
\
6. National Endowment for the Arts under Trump canceled grants and barred programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (2025-02-16): Defunding DEI\uc0\u8209 oriented arts projects used cultural funding levers to marginalize minority voices and constrain inclusive artistic expression.\
\
7. National Park Service under Trump removed references to transgender people from Stonewall National Monument materials (2025-02-16): Erasing transgender references from a landmark of LGBTQ+ history diminished recognition of a marginalized group\'92s role in civil\uc0\u8209 rights struggles.\
\
8. Department of Defense Education Activity ordered censorship of DEI and gender\uc0\u8209 related content in military schools, including book removals and curriculum changes (2025-02-18): Purging materials on women, minorities, and LGBTQ people from DoD schools narrowed students\'92 exposure to pluralistic history and identities, reshaping civic education for military families.\
\
9. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ordered destruction and removal of workplace safety publications flagged in a DEI purge (2025-02-17): Trashing safety documents, many unrelated to DEI, reduced workers\'92 access to official guidance and showed how culture\uc0\u8209 war directives can erode practical protections.\
\
10. Trump administration removed references to Black Americans from some federal websites during Black History Month (2025-02-19): Scrubbing mentions of Black people from official sites during Black History Month diminished public recognition of Black contributions and reinforced perceptions of racial exclusion.\
\
11. Protesters and civil society groups organized demonstrations against LGBTQ+ erasure, DOGE cuts, and broader administration policies (2025-02-16): Street protests at Stonewall, DOD schools, Tesla dealerships, SpaceX, and nationwide rallies signaled active public resistance to perceived rollbacks of rights and public services.\
\
12. Department of Justice and DC US Attorney Ed Martin launched Operation Whirlwind to investigate perceived threats against officials, including inquiries to members of Congress (2025-02-19): A new initiative to probe \'93threats\'94 following criticism of Musk\'92s DOGE team risked conflating sharp political speech with criminal conduct, chilling dissent.\
\
13. Department of Justice sent a letter accusing Rep. Robert Garcia of threatening Elon Musk over critical comments (2025-02-17): Treating a legislator\'92s criticism of a powerful ally as a potential threat signaled use of law\uc0\u8209 enforcement tools to intimidate elected opponents.\
\
14. Trump administration and ICE leadership fired and reassigned ICE officials for insufficient deportation numbers (2025-02-20): Tying leadership tenure to deportation metrics incentivized more aggressive enforcement, with implications for due process and humane treatment of migrants.\
\
15. Criminal justice authorities in New York charged five individuals with the murder of transgender man Sam Nordquist (2025-02-16): Prosecuting a brutal killing of a transgender man underscored both the severity of anti\uc0\u8209 trans violence and the role of the justice system in addressing such hate\u8209 motivated crimes.\
\
16. Trump administration and EEOC aligned federal employment policy with a binary definition of sex, limiting protections for transgender workers (2025-02-16): Reinterpreting sex discrimination law to exclude gender identity narrowed workplace protections for transgender employees and signaled official disfavor toward their claims.\
\
17. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary continued anti\uc0\u8209 vaccine advocacy and launched a review of the childhood vaccine schedule during a measles outbreak (2025-02-19): Questioning established vaccine schedules from a top health post during an outbreak risked undermining public confidence in immunization and increasing preventable disease.\
\
18. Trump administration ended federal benefits for undocumented immigrants through executive action (2025-02-20): Curtailing access to federal benefits for undocumented residents deepened stratification of rights and social protections based on legal status.\
\
19. Trump administration and National Labor Relations Board fired NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox and weakened labor enforcement (2025-02-18): Removing a pro\uc0\u8209 worker NLRB member reduced the board\'92s capacity to protect organizing and collective bargaining, tilting the field toward employers.\
\
20. Trump administration canceled collective bargaining agreements and rescinded contractor protections for federal workers (2025-02-18): Voiding union contracts and protections for federal contractors eroded workers\'92 ability to negotiate conditions and defend against arbitrary treatment.\
\
21. Trump administration and DOGE pressured agencies to share sensitive personal data, prompting resignations (2025-02-19): Efforts to obtain SSA and Notify.gov data, and the resulting resignations, highlighted risks that personal information could be used to target or monitor specific groups.\
\
22. Trump administration and DOJ pursued selective enforcement and pardons benefiting allies while investigating corporate fraud at UnitedHealthcare (2025-02-21): Simultaneous leniency toward political allies and scrutiny of a major insurer illustrated uneven application of legal power across different powerful actors.\
\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1. Elon Musk\'92s DOGE committee gained access to sensitive health\uc0\u8209 agency systems and sought IRS and SSA data (2025-02-15): Allowing a politically aligned quasi\u8209 agency to tap into CDC, CMS, IRS, and SSA systems concentrated vast personal and financial data under opaque executive\u8209 adjacent control.\
\
2. White House and State Department under Trump banned Associated Press journalists from key venues and ordered cancellation of non\uc0\u8209 mission\u8209 critical media subscriptions worldwide (2025-02-16): Excluding AP from briefings, the Oval Office, and Air Force One, and cutting embassy media subscriptions, punished independent reporting and narrowed diplomats\'92 information sources.\
\
3. Elon Musk called for imprisonment of journalists over critical coverage of the administration (2025-02-16): Publicly urging jail time for reporters signaled hostility toward investigative journalism and could intimidate media outlets covering government actions.\
\
4. President Trump misrepresented the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s purpose regarding birthright citizenship (2025-02-16): Falsely claiming the Fourteenth Amendment was only for formerly enslaved people undermined public understanding of constitutional citizenship guarantees.\

\
9. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump administration negotiators offered Ukraine support in exchange for half its mineral resources and pursued similar leaked plans (2025-02-12): Linking security assistance to large stakes in Ukraine\'92s mineral wealth framed foreign aid as a vehicle for resource extraction rather than solidarity with a besieged democracy.\
\
