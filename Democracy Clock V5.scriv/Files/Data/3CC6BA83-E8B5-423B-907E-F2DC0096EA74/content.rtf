\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 5 of Trump\'92s second term marks a shift from testing limits to rewiring the state. The Democracy Clock moves from 7:40 to 7:43 p.m., a modest numerical change that masks a dense cluster of structural blows. Through Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency, the administration orchestrates mass firings across health, environmental, land management, foreign aid, and tax agencies, while courts largely decline to halt the purge. Executive orders pull independent regulators under White House review and normalize emergency-style governance. At the Justice Department, prosecutors are coerced into dropping a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, January 6 offenders are pardoned and celebrated, and loyalists like Kash Patel and Ed Martin take command of key law-enforcement posts. Simultaneously, military schools, OSHA, the National Park Service, and the Kennedy Center are conscripted into a project of ideological education and symbolic control. Abroad, U.S. policy tilts toward Russian narratives on Ukraine and transactional mineral-rights deals. Pockets of judicial and state-level resistance persist, but the week\'92s through-line is consolidation: law, bureaucracy, and memory bent toward personal rule.\
