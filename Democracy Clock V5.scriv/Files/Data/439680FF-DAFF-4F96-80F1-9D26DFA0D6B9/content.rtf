\
*A quiet week in which tariffs, detention, and funding levers deepened executive dominance while courts, campuses, and data were bent toward loyalist rule.*\

Week 28 unfolded as a week of consolidation rather than shock. The surface picture was one of continuity: the same president, the same Congress, the same courts. Yet beneath that surface, the architecture of power shifted another notch toward a system in which law, money, and information serve the executive first and the public only incidentally. The week\'92s events did not hinge on a single spectacular order or crisis. Instead, they formed a dense web of moves\'97tariff decrees, funding freezes, detention practices, and appointments\'97that together made it harder to see where neutral governance ended and personal rule began. The state\'92s basic promises\'97equal citizenship, independent courts, a professional civil service\'97were not abolished. They were bent further to fit the needs of one man and his circle.\
\
At the close of Week 27, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:53 p.m., already deep into the evening of the constitutional day. By the end of Week 28, the public time remained 7:53 p.m., yet the underlying measure crept forward by 0.2 minutes. The face of the clock did not move, but the mechanism did. That small internal advance captures the character of the week. There was no single break that would force the hand to jump. Instead, there was a thickening of patterns already present: law used as a weapon rather than a limit, citizenship stratified by ancestry and status, the civil service and judiciary filled and disciplined for loyalty, universities and media brought to heel through money and regulation, and emergency economic tools normalized as instruments of routine policy. The system still resembled a democracy in form. In function, it edged further toward something else.\
\
The most visible strand of that shift ran through the law itself. Across the week, the administration treated statutes and legal tools less as constraints than as flexible instruments for punishing enemies and managing risk. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a relic from the early republic, was invoked to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties without hearings or warrants. Justice Department lawyers argued that the Act allowed raids and removals without court review, and planes carrying deportees continued to El Salvador despite a federal judge\'92s order to return them. At the same time, a new detention camp in the Everglades\'97nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz\'97held hundreds of people without charges, access to lawyers, or bond hearings. When civil rights lawyers sought emergency relief, they were told the court lacked jurisdiction. In both cases, the message was the same. For certain categories of people, law would not be a shield; it would be the language in which their exclusion was justified.\
\
This instrumental view of law extended beyond immigration. The Department of Justice filed a misconduct complaint against a federal judge, James Boasberg, for public comments about the administration, signaling that judges who spoke candidly about executive conduct could face formal discipline. At the same time, the attorney general\'92s office pressed courts to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases, while other parts of the federal apparatus ordered Trump\'92s name redacted from related files and pressured the FBI records chief who objected into retirement. The administration floated the possibility of a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell and sent a senior deputy attorney general to interview her, even as victims and lawmakers demanded assurances that no clemency would be offered. Law, in this pattern, became a set of levers: secrecy here, selective transparency there, discipline for a critical judge, leniency for a well-connected defendant.\
\
Citizenship itself was narrowed in theory and in practice. Vice President J.D. Vance used a speech at the Claremont Institute to argue that American citizenship should be rooted in blood and soil, suggesting that those whose ancestors fought in the Civil War had a greater claim to the nation than more recent arrivals. The Department of Homeland Security amplified this vision by posting the 19th-century painting \'93American Progress,\'94 with a caption celebrating a \'93Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending,\'94 and by repurposing a contemporary religious painting without the artist\'92s consent to evoke nationalist sentiment. These symbolic gestures were matched by policy. The administration moved to strip legal status from more than a million immigrants by terminating the CHNV parole program and ramping up arrests, urged DACA recipients to \'93self-deport\'94 despite no regulatory change, and announced SNAP changes that would shift costs to states and tighten eligibility for non-citizens. In detention, a double-amputee from Liberia was placed in solitary confinement for refusing to enter a flooded area that threatened his prosthetic legs. Together, these actions hardened a tiered system in which ancestry, nationality, and identity determined not only one\'92s chances in life, but the degree of protection the law would offer.\
\
The civil service, long designed as a buffer between politics and administration, came under sharper partisan control. The week saw the firing of the Commissioner of Labor Statistics after a weak jobs report that the president denounced as \'93rigged.\'94 She was to be replaced by a political appointee, signaling that official economic data would henceforth be judged not by methodological rigor but by whether it flattered the White House narrative. At the Food and Drug Administration, the top vaccine and gene therapy official resigned after a public campaign against him led by a right-wing activist, and the head of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness resigned after revealing he had never been formally appointed at all. The Office of Personnel Management issued guidance allowing federal employees to pray publicly at work and to persuade colleagues of their religious views, blurring the line between personal faith and public duty. In the national security sphere, the top lawyer at the National Security Agency was fired after right-wing media labeled her a \'93far-left Democrat activist\'94 based on her past work for Senate Democrats. These moves did not abolish the civil service. They bent it, making clear that tenure and expertise offered less protection than ideological alignment.\
\
The judiciary, too, moved another step away from independence. The Senate confirmed Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney and senior Justice Department official, to a lifetime seat on the federal appeals court by a 50\'9649 vote. This came despite whistleblower allegations that he had urged colleagues to ignore court orders regarding migrant flights and misled Congress about dropping corruption charges against the mayor of New York. More than eighty judges and multiple whistleblowers had raised concerns about his fitness. The confirmation went forward anyway, with the Republican majority treating loyalty as a credential rather than a warning sign. At the same time, the Justice Department maneuvered to keep loyal U.S. attorneys in place by designating interim prosecutors as acting just before their statutory terms expired, preventing district judges from appointing replacements. In New Jersey, questions about the legality of Alina Habba\'92s appointment as acting U.S. attorney led to the cancellation of federal criminal proceedings. The pattern was clear. Prosecutorial power would remain in trusted hands, and the bench would be stocked with those who had already demonstrated a willingness to bend law to executive needs.\
\
Against this backdrop, Congress looked smaller and more reactive. In Washington, House Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned the chamber early to avoid a vote on releasing Epstein files, even as members of both parties called for more transparency. In Missouri, a Republican supermajority moved to repeal or weaken multiple voter-approved measures on Medicaid expansion, marijuana, abortion rights, and animal welfare, prompting a bipartisan backlash from citizens who saw their votes being undone. In North Carolina, the General Assembly overrode the governor\'92s vetoes on bills easing environmental rules for a major utility, tightening immigration enforcement, and restricting recognition of gender identities beyond male and female. The same legislature rescheduled a hearing on a voter suppression bill to a time that would limit public attendance. In Texas, Republicans unveiled a congressional map designed to give their party five additional seats, targeting districts with large minority populations. These were not isolated acts of partisanship. They were pieces of a broader pattern in which legislatures functioned less as deliberative bodies and more as instruments for entrenching power, often at the expense of direct democratic decisions and fair representation.\
\
Universities and schools became central battlegrounds in this struggle over power and narrative. The administration froze $108 million in federal research funding to Duke University over alleged racial discrimination in affirmative action, and reached a settlement with Columbia University that required a $221 million payment and a pledge not to consider race, color, sex, or national origin in hiring in order to restore $1.3 billion in previously withheld funds. At the same time, the Department of Education and other agencies mandated antisemitism trainings at universities, designed by pro-Israel groups and criticized for equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, as a condition for federal funding. These trainings were rolled out at Northwestern, Columbia, Harvard, and other campuses under the threat of investigations and funding cuts. The Department of Justice sent letters to Duke and George Mason University scrutinizing diversity and equity policies, and the administration launched an investigation into the Duke Law Journal over alleged race-based preferences. In Oklahoma, the state schools chief announced that teachers from \'93liberal\'94 states would have to pass a \'93MAGA Exam,\'94 developed with a conservative media outfit, to be certified. Together, these moves used money, accreditation, and regulatory scrutiny to narrow the range of acceptable ideas in education, not by banning dissent outright, but by making it costly.\
\
The executive\'92s reach into economic life widened through a series of tariff orders and fiscal maneuvers that blurred the line between emergency and routine policy. Over the course of the week, the president declared a national emergency over Brazil\'92s treatment of Jair Bolsonaro and imposed an additional 40 percent duty on certain Brazilian imports, suspended duty-free treatment for all low-value imports, and issued an order \'93further modifying\'94 reciprocal tariff rates on multiple trading partners. New tariffs of 10 to 25 percent were announced on goods from India, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, and others, often tied to grievances over trade deficits, energy purchases from Russia, or foreign policy positions such as Canada\'92s recognition of Palestinian statehood. A separate order raised tariffs on Canadian goods from 25 to 35 percent and imposed a 40 percent levy on transshipped goods, citing both drug trafficking and political disagreements. These measures were justified under emergency and national security statutes, particularly the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, even as a federal appeals court heard arguments that such use of IEEPA exceeded congressional intent. In practice, they allowed the president to rewire global trade flows and raise consumer prices without new legislation, while claiming credit for \'93deals\'94 whose terms were often vague or misrepresented.\
\
At the same time, domestic fiscal tools were repurposed to concentrate power. The administration explored \'93pocket rescissions\'94 to withhold funds Congress had already allocated by sending rescission requests late enough that the money would expire before lawmakers could act. A rescissions package signed earlier in the term had already cut previously appropriated education funds, testing the limits of the Impoundment Control Act. National Institutes of Health research grants were impounded and then partially restored after internal pushback, demonstrating how scientific work could be stalled or advanced at the pleasure of the White House. The Treasury secretary described new \'93Trump accounts\'94 created by budget reconciliation as a \'93backdoor for privatizing Social Security,\'94 signaling a long-term strategy to shift a core public pension program into market-based accounts without a direct vote on privatization. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was restructured so that states would shoulder 75 percent of administrative costs by 2027 and a share of benefits thereafter, while work reporting requirements were expanded and non-citizen eligibility narrowed. These changes did not abolish the welfare state. They hollowed it, moving risk and cost downward to households and states while preserving federal discretion and donor-friendly tax cuts.\
\
Regulatory agencies, formally designed to balance public and private interests, were further drawn into the orbit of executive and corporate priorities. Staff at the newly created Department of Government Efficiency deployed an AI tool\'97the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool\'97to generate a \'93delete list\'94 of federal regulations, with a goal of eliminating half of all rules by January. The tool had already been used to drive decisions at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Its criteria were opaque, its operation shielded from public input. At the Environmental Protection Agency, leadership moved to revoke the 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding, which underpinned federal authority to regulate climate pollution, and issued an interim rule extending compliance deadlines for emissions standards in the oil and gas sector. The Interior Department ended subsidies for wind and solar energy, arguing that renewables had enjoyed \'93preferential treatment.\'94 The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a gun company backed by Donald Trump Jr. to trade publicly shortly after the new Trump-appointed chair attended a launch party for another Trump Jr. venture. The Federal Communications Commission approved a major media merger on the condition that the new entity avoid civil rights programming and install a political bias monitor. In each case, the formal processes of rulemaking and review remained. But their direction tilted: away from environmental and consumer protection, toward the interests of industries and insiders close to the president.\
\
Information and memory\'97what the public is told, what is recorded, what is forgotten\'97were contested as fiercely as law and money. The president called for revoking the broadcasting licenses of NBC and ABC, labeling them \'93an arm of the Democrat Party,\'94 and attacked individual commentators who criticized his policies, including a Fox News personality who had argued for stricter gun laws. An FCC commissioner warned that the administration was \'93weaponizing\'94 licensing power, noting that the threat of regulatory retaliation could induce self-censorship in newsrooms. Axios published a glowing account of the first six months of the second Trump term, describing it as highly successful and relying heavily on input from Trump aides, while omitting major controversies such as mass deportations, Medicaid cuts, and pardons related to January 6. Popular Information documented how Sinclair\'92s lead national anchor had resigned over right-wing bias and how corporate headquarters pushed propaganda disguised as local news. At the same time, investigative outlets exposed and helped reverse a Social Security plan to limit phone service, corrected a North Carolina election outcome by uncovering wrongly invalidated ballots, and revealed a Tennessee House speaker\'92s secret home purchase and misuse of per diem funds. The week thus showed both sides of the information struggle: a state leaning on regulators and friendly outlets to shape narratives, and independent journalists still able, in specific cases, to force corrections.\
\
On the ground, the security apparatus continued to align more with the preservation of power than with the protection of people. FEMA launched a $608 million grant program to fund temporary migrant detention facilities, effectively expanding the infrastructure for mass confinement under the banner of emergency management. Private prison operator CoreCivic, already under FBI investigation for staff-facilitated drug trafficking and overdose deaths at its Cibola County facility, sought to expand its immigrant detention operations there. In Georgia, a disabled detainee was placed in solitary confinement for three days without water or power for his prosthetic legs after refusing to enter a flooded area. In Florida, a lawful permanent resident known locally as the \'93mushroom man\'94 faced deportation over a decades-old drug arrest he had failed to disclose on a citizenship application. A South Korean scientist with a green card was arrested at San Francisco International Airport by immigration officials and denied access to an attorney, with no public explanation. Meanwhile, the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of most National Guard troops from Los Angeles, who had been deployed to manage protests against immigration policies, leaving a smaller contingent to guard federal assets. The partial pullback eased one visible sign of militarization. The broader pattern of harsh enforcement and detention remained.\
\
Civil society did not stand still in the face of these shifts. Protesters in North Carolina packed a legislative hearing room to oppose HB 958, a bill seen as undermining electoral integrity, and their presence drew local media coverage. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including elected officials, were arrested at Senator Chuck Schumer\'92s office in New York while demanding an end to bombing and the admission of aid into Gaza. In New Orleans, the city government launched a municipal ID program to give undocumented and homeless residents access to services and proof of identity, a local attempt to mitigate the exclusionary effects of federal policy. State attorneys general and governors from Democratic states sued to block Planned Parenthood funding cuts and to challenge an executive order threatening hospital funds for providing gender-affirming care to youth. Senator Ron Wyden called for an inspector general investigation into reports that agents were being reassigned from child exploitation cases to immigration enforcement. These acts did not reverse the week\'92s structural changes. They did show that pockets of institutional and civic resistance remained, even as the costs of such resistance rose.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 28, several processes were already in motion that would shape the months to come. The federal appeals court\'92s review of the president\'92s use of IEEPA for tariffs would test whether the judiciary was willing to place meaningful limits on emergency economic powers. The lawsuits over the Alien Enemies Act deportations, Alligator Alcatraz, and the use of Cecot prison in El Salvador would determine whether due process protections could be restored for targeted migrants. State and federal courts would have to decide whether Texas could project its abortion laws into New York, and whether shield laws protecting providers would hold. The multistate suit over transgender youth healthcare, the challenges to DEI bans and antisemitism trainings on campuses, and the investigations into media mergers and licensing conditions would all bear on how much space remained for dissent in education and information. The Texas redistricting map and California\'92s potential special election on redrawing its own districts would shape the balance of power in the House. None of these were hypothetical. They were already filed, scheduled, or announced.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock still read 7:53 p.m., but the sense of late hour deepened. The week mattered not because it introduced entirely new practices, but because it layered them. Emergency tariff powers were not only asserted; they were normalized and extended. Law was not only bent in one domain; it was used as a weapon across immigration, welfare, education, and the courts. Citizenship was not only rhetorically narrowed; it was materially stratified through deportations, benefit cuts, and detention regimes. The civil service and judiciary were not only criticized; they were reshaped and disciplined to favor loyalty. Universities and media were not only argued with; they were threatened with funding cuts, licensing action, and biased oversight. In this accumulation, the distance between the formal shell of democracy and the lived reality of power widened another small but measurable degree. The official time at the close of Week 28 remained 7:53 p.m. The mechanisms behind the dial, however, ticked forward, recording a republic that still held elections and courts and newspapers, but in which those institutions served the executive\'92s will more often than they constrained it.\
