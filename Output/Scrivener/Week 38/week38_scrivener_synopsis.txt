Week 38 of Trump’s second term saw the Democracy Clock hold at 8:08 p.m., moving only a tenth of a minute while underlying structures shifted. Immigration enforcement in Chicago and Portland became a pretext for militarized federal presence, with ICE agents using battlefield tactics against protesters and journalists and National Guard units deployed into Democratic-led cities over local objections. Governors and judges in Illinois, Oregon, and California fought back, winning partial limits on deployments and protest policing, yet enforcement and detention expanded as oversight offices were furloughed and controversial facilities like Alligator Alcatraz stayed open on fresh federal money.

In Washington, the Justice Department and FBI were further repurposed: anti-corruption units were gutted, the Homan bribery probe was closed, and Trump critics James Comey and Letitia James were indicted while elite-linked cases like the Epstein files remained shrouded. The shutdown became an instrument of partisan restructuring, as OMB canceled projects in Democratic areas and cast doubt on back pay for furloughed workers. Simultaneously, the White House tightened information control, promoted vaccine misinformation, and elevated Trump-centric symbols, even as civil society, professional associations, and scattered courts mounted reactive resistance.
