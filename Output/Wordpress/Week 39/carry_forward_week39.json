The administration weaponized law and bureaucracy against opponents (Antifa \u201cterrorist\u201d designation, Soros RICO probe, Bolton and Comey/James indictments, IRS targeting plans) while simultaneously purging and constraining the civil service through mass layoffs, a sweeping federal hiring freeze, and loyalty-driven purges. Federal power and money were openly used as partisan weapons: shutdown-driven layoffs and selective funding freezes hit Democratic regions hardest, while crony bailouts and foreign-policy quid pro quos with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina deepened emoluments-style corruption. Civil liberties came under pressure from militarized immigration raids, threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, domestic troop deployments, and a new NSPM redefining dissent as extremism. Press freedom and academic autonomy were attacked via Pentagon gag rules, defamation suits, campus compacts, and student-media censorship. At the same time, courts, states, universities, unions, and media mounted notable resistance\u2014blocking Guard deployments, layoffs, ICE abuses, H\u20111B fees, and Pentagon press rules\u2014highlighting that while structural pressure toward competitive authoritarianism is intense, countervailing institutions are still active but under strain.",
