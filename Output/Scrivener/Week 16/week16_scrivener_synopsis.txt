Week 16 of Trump’s second term left the Democracy Clock unmoved at 7:59 p.m., but the terrain beneath it thickened. Across immigration, media, and the civil service, existing tools were wielded more confidently to stratify rights and access. Emergency-style deportations, a freeze on ICE releases, deputized federal agents, and a massive detention budget push turned immigration into a standing quasi-emergency, even as rare court victories for detainees underscored how exceptional due process had become. Inside government, DOGE-led purges, hiring freezes, watchdog retreats, and cuts at EPA, USAID, and safety agencies hollowed out neutral expertise and shifted power toward loyalists and industry. Public and independent media were defunded, dismantled, or pressured, with Voice of America replaced by partisan content and the FCC probing CBS. Universities, arts funding, and even geographic names were leveraged to reward compliant narratives. Courts, state governments, and professional groups mounted scattered resistance, but their successes were reactive and partial.
