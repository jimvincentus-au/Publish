Week 11 of Trump’s second term marked a consolidation of trends that had been building for months. The White House invoked a self‑styled economic “Liberation Day” and a national emergency to impose sweeping tariffs, rattling markets while carving out protections for fossil‑fuel donors and firms tied to Elon Musk, whose “department of government efficiency” continued to drive mass civil‑service layoffs and agency closures. Law and emergency powers were repeatedly stretched: Trump floated “methods” for a third term, allies moved to amend presidential term limits, and immigration authorities used obscure provisions and a tattoo‑based “Alien Enemies” guide to detain and deport students and Venezuelan migrants until courts intervened. Universities, media outlets, and cultural institutions faced funding threats and investigations unless they curbed dissent. New voting rules and court decisions tightened access to the ballot even as a billionaire‑saturated Wisconsin race showed money’s reach. Resistance—from judges, state attorneys general, Booker’s marathon speech, and organized protest—persisted but could not offset the structural tilt toward personal rule and crony capitalism. The Democracy Clock advanced from 9:59 p.m. to 10:11 p.m.
