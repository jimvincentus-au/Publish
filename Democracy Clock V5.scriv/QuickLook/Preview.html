<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a sharp erosion of protections for vulnerable groups, especially immigrants and LGBTQ people. Trump’s assertion of direct control over U.S. Steel, repeated defiance or manipulation of statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delays, National Guard federalization, DHS oversight rules), and deregulatory favors to crypto and fossil-fuel interests...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week delivers a concentrated shock to multiple pillars of American democracy. The most acute pressure comes from unilateral war-making against Iran without congressional authorization, followed by a Supreme Court decision sharply limiting nationwide injunctions. Together they expand executive freedom of action while constraining judicial remedies, directly intensifying traits 1 and 4 (unchecked executive power and law as weapon). Simultaneously, ...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week marks a major structural lurch toward authoritarian governance, anchored by passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill and a cluster of Supreme Court decisions expanding executive impunity and constraining judicial checks. The bill simultaneously entrenches plutocratic tax policy, slashes the social safety net, and massively expands immigration enforcement and detention capacity, hardwiring inequality (trait 36) and stratified...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week reflects an acute phase of authoritarian consolidation centered on executive overreach, weaponized law, and the hollowing out of the professional state. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling and its greenlighting of mass federal layoffs, combined with Trump’s unilateral use of emergency powers for tariffs, war-making, and immigration crackdowns, sharply weaken checks on the presidency (Traits 1, 4, 5, 13, 14).

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, centered on three converging fronts: weaponization of the immigration and security apparatus, politicization and hollowing-out of the civil service and justice system, and a coordinated squeeze on independent information and public goods.

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was an exceptionally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive consolidating power across law enforcement, regulation, information, and social policy. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fell on rule-of-law traits (4, 9, 22, 51), as DOJ and ICE were further politicized and expanded, consent decrees and police reforms were rolled back, and a new Obama-focused “strike force” signaled overt use of prosecutorial power against political e...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with emergency authorities and trade tools stretched into quasi-permanent instruments of unilateral rule. Trump’s tariff blitz—via multiple executive orders and a sweeping de minimis suspension—recasts trade law as a personal lever, while courts simultaneously hear challenges to his IEEPA-based tariff authority. Judicial independence takes a major hit: Emil Bove’s confirmation despite whis...</p>
