Despite Columbia's compliance, the funding was not immediately restored, and the administration indicated ongoing monitoring of the university's adherence to the imposed policies.",

The vote on the resolution could occur soon, with potential Republican defections representing a significant rebuke of Trump by his party.

The tariffs include a 10% levy on UK imports and a 20% levy on other European imports, with varying rates on other countries. This move has caused concern among New York shopkeepers, who anticipate having to raise prices significantly, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and a recession. The tariffs are part of Trump's broader economic strategy, despite warnings from economists about potential negative impacts.",
