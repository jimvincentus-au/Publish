Across Trump’s fifty-third week in office, the Democracy Clock barely moved, but the machinery behind it shifted sharply. Minnesota became the showcase: 3,000 federal immigration agents flooded the state, operating under a memo that treated administrative removal orders as licenses for warrantless home entries. A U.S. citizen and schoolchildren were swept up; an ICE officer killed Renee Good, and the Justice Department refused to investigate even as prosecutors resigned. Parallel crackdowns in Maine and the termination of protections for Venezuelans and Iranians signaled that status and safety now turned on origin and ideology. Emergency powers framed immigration, tariffs, and foreign strikes as routine tools of rule, while threats to defund sanctuary cities and prosecute internal dissenters extended punishment to officials and bureaucrats. At the same time, crypto deregulation, the Genius Act, and a pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao rewarded aligned wealth. Civil society answered with national walkouts and strikes, and some courts and states pushed back, but their resistance lagged behind an executive increasingly comfortable governing through raids, emergencies, and patronage.
