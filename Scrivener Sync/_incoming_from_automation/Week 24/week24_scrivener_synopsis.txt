Week 24 of Trump’s second term fixed the Democracy Clock at 10:58 p.m., but only because damage and resistance canceled each other out. Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” locking in extended tax cuts for the wealthy, deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, and massive new funding for ICE, detention centers, and defense projects like the “Golden Dome” shield. Senate Republicans bent procedure, sidelining the parliamentarian and GAO, and rewriting budget baselines to hide trillions in deficits. On the ground, ICE raids, deaths in custody, and the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades made mass detention a visible fact of life, while denaturalization directives and TPS terminations threatened citizenship itself. The Supreme Court narrowed nationwide injunctions and allowed partial enforcement of Trump’s birthright‑citizenship order, fragmenting rights by geography. Yet federal judges blocked the asylum ban and TPS termination, states sued over data‑sharing and school cuts, regulators advanced some environmental protections, and protesters and dissenting Republicans pushed back. Structural harm deepened, but countervailing institutions kept the hands from moving closer to midnight.
