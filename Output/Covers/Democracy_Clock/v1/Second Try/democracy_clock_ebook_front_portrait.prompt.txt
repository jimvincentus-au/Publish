Democracy Clock — eBook cover background artwork (front cover only).
    ORIENTATION: portrait, optimized for eBook thumbnails and square-safe cropping.

    PALETTE + TONE (CANONICAL)
- archival artifact aesthetic; institutional, documentary, historically grounded
- richer, disciplined tones (not pale tan): deep slate blue, smoky steel, warm parchment, restrained amber highlights
- low saturation overall but with deeper midtones; moderate contrast; avoid both crushed blacks and washed-out beige
- soft diffuse light with gentle directional falloff; no theatrical spotlighting; no neon
- subtle archival grain / paper texture / film noise (NOT painterly brushwork; NOT flat vector illustration)
- mood: serious, authoritative, evidentiary; calm gravity rather than melodrama

    SUBJECT + MOTIF
    - archival artifact aesthetic tuned for small thumbnails: simple, authoritative, documentary
    - a single cohesive motif (choose one): partial clock rim OR institutional architectural silhouette OR archival paper layers
    - visual continuity cue with the print covers: implied circular falloff, partial clock rim shadow, or curved edge suggested through light and texture only (no full clock face)
    - cooler slate-blue and smoky steel midtones as the dominant base, with restrained warm parchment highlights layered secondarily; deeper midtone density to visually match the print covers
    - do not combine multiple motifs; keep it singular and thumbnail-strong
    - faint archival textures: paper grain, filing lines, ledger patterns (NON-readable, abstract)
    - avoid flat geometric iconography; avoid “logo-like” minimalism

    COMPOSITION
    - Central, stable composition with strong visual coherence.
    - Guarantee square-safe cropping: key motif stays within the central 60%.
    - Maintain generous negative space in upper and central areas for Canva text overlay.
    - Keep detail simple and bold enough to survive very small sizes.
    - Avoid heavy vignettes or edge-darkening that harms thumbnail clarity.
    - Tonal balance must visually align with the 6x9 and 7x10 print covers when viewed side-by-side; avoid warmer overall temperature or flatter contrast than the print editions
    - Documentary/archival-photographic feel; not cartoonish; not vector.

    GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- Aim for documentary realism / archival-photographic feel; avoid cartoonish, cute, or graphic-illustration styles
- Avoid flat iconography, vector shapes, or simplified clip-art geometry
- NO text, NO letters, NO numbers, NO words, NO logos, NO seals, NO signage, NO watermarks
- Avoid plaques, banners, etched stone, carved inscriptions, newspapers with readable headlines
- NO modern campaign graphics; NO partisan iconography
- Do not depict identifiable real people; crowds may be implied/silhouetted
- Avoid gore, violence, weapons, or explicit confrontation
- Composition must read at thumbnail size
- Maintain negative space for later Canva title/subtitle overlay
