\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 29 Appendix: Data and Campuses Under Command\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarian governance. The executive branch expanded its reach through a barrage of executive orders, aggressive immigration and policing initiatives, and politicized use of trade, health, and education policy. Multiple moves targeted core guardrails simultaneously: independent data production (BLS firings, crime and vaccine data manipulation), neutral administration of justice (purges and politicized probes at DOJ, FBI, and state AGs), and fair representation (mid\uc0\u8209 decade gerrymanders, census manipulation, and coercive use of law enforcement against legislators). Universities and civil society came under coordinated financial and regulatory pressure, while immigration enforcement infrastructure and detention capacity were rapidly expanded and partially militarized. Economic policy was reoriented around tariffs, crony contracts, and regulatory favors for donors, deepening inequality and embedding crony capitalism. Information and memory systems were also contested: official records and human-rights reporting were altered or withheld, while media and higher education were disciplined. A few countervailing actions\'97judicial checks on the Everglades jail, voting-rights legislation, redistricting walkouts, and oversight subpoenas\'97show institutional resistance, but they are outweighed by the breadth and entrenchment of authoritarian-style practices.\
