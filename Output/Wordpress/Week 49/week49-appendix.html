<h1>Week 49 Appendix: Files As Instruments of Power</h1>
<p><em>A week when transparency laws, courts, and agencies kept their formal shape while their inner workings bent toward secrecy, loyalty, and selective punishment.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an executive increasingly willing to defy legal constraints while building a punitive, loyalty-based state. The most intense structural pressure falls on transparency and archival integrity, as the Justice Department’s noncompliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, selective redactions, document removals, and politicized messaging collectively normalize lawbreaking to shield elites. Simultaneously, immigration enforcement is scaled up into a semi-permanent infrastructure of mass detention and militarized control, with record ICE detentions, warehouse-style facilities, National Guard deployments to cities, and dehumanizing official rhetoric. Agencies are repurposed to serve ideological and economic allies: environmental and renewable energy programs are dismantled in favor of fossil interests; the VA is ordered to end abortion care; DOJ sues to preempt local gun regulation while dropping crypto probes amid conflicts of interest. Civil service and diplomacy are hollowed out through politicized recalls and job cuts, while symbolic projects like the Trump-Kennedy Center and Trump-class battleships redirect public resources toward personal glorification. Courts and some legislators push back—blocking Guard deployments, funding retaliation, and the Kennedy Center name change—but the net effect is a sharp tilt toward unaccountable, personalized executive power.</p>
