Immigration enforcement is overtly repurposed to punish pro\u2011Palestinian activism, with Khalil\u2019s detention under a foreign\u2011policy pretext, visa revocations, family detention, and plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Simultaneously, the administration seeks to end birthright citizenship, normalize emergency powers around tariffs and the border, and retaliate against disfavored law firms. Internationally, the US abandons climate and anti\u2011corruption leadership, escalates trade wars with allies, flirts with NATO withdrawal, and aligns more openly with Russian aims. Civil society mobilizes\u2014mass protests, town halls, watchdog tools like the Musk Watch tracker\u2014but faces surveillance, subpoenas, and delegitimization as \u201cterrorists.\u201d Structurally, this is a high\u2011pressure week of authoritarian drift, partially checked by an increasingly assertive judiciary.",
