Week 42 traces a government that no longer bothers to disguise whom it serves. The Democracy Clock moved from 11:25 p.m. to 11:26 p.m.—a modest numerical shift driven by a dense pattern of self‑dealing and defiance. Mass pardons for election subversion figures and controversial allies, alongside pressure on prosecutors to pursue critics, turned law into a shield for insiders and a weapon against opponents. The administration ignored and attacked court orders to fund SNAP, using hunger during a record shutdown as leverage, even as judges insisted on payments and senators postured instead of governing. Regulatory favors flowed to a well‑connected medical firm that secretly financed a new White House ballroom, while the East Wing was demolished and tribal climate funds remained frozen. ICE raids, plans for private bounty hunters, and a vast detention build‑out aligned security forces with elite preservation. Yet voters in multiple states rejected suppression, defended ballot access, and elected officials promising institutional repair, and some courts pushed back. The week captures a democracy still functioning, but increasingly organized around crony capitalism, stratified citizenship, and a moral floor treated as optional.
