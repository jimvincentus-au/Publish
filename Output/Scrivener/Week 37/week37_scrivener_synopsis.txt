Week 37 unfolded without a single constitutional rupture, yet the circuitry of American democracy was quietly rewired. The administration used the shutdown and a Deferred Resignation Program to force more than 100,000 federal workers out, threaten mass firings, and politicize immigration courts by replacing judges with military lawyers. OMB canceled or froze billions in climate and transit funding, disproportionately in Democratic-led cities, while economic data releases were delayed and foreign bailouts continued. Immigration and protest spaces became laboratories for harsher governance: militarized raids in Chicago, deportations of long-settled refugees and a journalist, and rules tying victim aid to immigration status deepened a tiered system of rights. Simultaneously, Trump framed domestic politics as war, floated strikes in Venezuela, and labeled Antifa terrorists. Deepfakes, pseudoscientific health claims, partisan agency emails, and the suspension of Voice of America showed the state itself becoming a disinformation engine. Courts, unions, and some states pushed back, but mostly slowed rather than reversed the drift.
