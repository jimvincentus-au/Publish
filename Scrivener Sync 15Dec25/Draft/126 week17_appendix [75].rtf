\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 17 Appendix: Borders and Money as Weapons\
\
This week shows an administration moving from illiberal drift toward a more openly authoritarian operating model, with countervailing resistance from courts, some state governments, and civil society. Structurally, the heaviest pressure falls on rule-of-law constraints, immigration-based stratification of rights, and the fusion of foreign money with presidential decision-making. The Qatar jet and Trump Organization\'92s Gulf deals intertwine personal enrichment, arms sales, and U.S. policy, sharply intensifying crony capitalism and foreign influence. Simultaneously, DOJ and DHS are repurposed against perceived enemies\'97prosecutors, judges, immigrants, students, and former officials\'97while openly musing about suspending habeas corpus and naming-and-shaming political opponents. New executive orders weaponize immigration law against ideology and speech, as ICE and FBI resources are redirected from white-collar crime to mass deportation. Yet federal courts repeatedly push back, blocking fast-track deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and ordering releases of students detained for pro-Palestinian activism. Congress is divided: Republicans advance tools to strip nonprofits\'92 tax status and cut Medicaid, but internal fractures stall Trump\'92s megabill. Overall, the week deepens institutional corrosion and normalization of emergency-style governance, even as judicial decisions and public protest keep some guardrails intact.\

\
13.
