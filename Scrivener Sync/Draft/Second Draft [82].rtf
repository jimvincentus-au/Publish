\f1\b0\fs28 \
\
The United States did not begin as a democracy. It began as a collection of experiments\'97some hopeful, some harsh, all incomplete\'97in which communities tried to govern themselves under conditions they barely understood. What we now call the founding era was not the birth of a republic but the slow accumulation of habits, institutions, exclusions, and contradictions that shaped the country that followed. To look backward through the Democracy Clock is to measure not what the United States was, but what it was becoming: a political culture carrying democratic potential and authoritarian inheritance in equal measure.\
\
The first colonies were not designed for equality. They were designed for survival, commerce, or the enforcement of religious orthodoxy. Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the other colonies each brought their own structures of power, but all shared a common asymmetry: authority flowed downward, not upward. Governors answered to distant monarchs or private owners. Assemblies, when permitted, represented only property-holding men. Courts often reflected the will of executives rather than the law. These were not deviations; they were the architecture of the age. Yet within these constraints, traditions of local autonomy\'97town meetings, community covenants, and elected councils\'97took root. The contradiction would shape everything that followed.\
\
Colonial life was structured around hierarchy. Wealth determined access to justice, representation, and security. Religion regulated belonging. Race defined humanity itself. Enslavement was not a peripheral practice but central to economic and political life from the Chesapeake to New England. Indigenous peoples were treated as obstacles to be displaced or conquered. Women were legal dependents of fathers or husbands. These patterns were not simply moral flaws. They were the structural expression of authoritarian traits\'97exclusion, stratification, and coercion woven into daily life. Long before the Revolution, the colonies displayed the majority of the tendencies that the Democracy Clock now identifies as symptoms of decline.\
\
Crises revealed the vulnerabilities of colonial governance. King Philip\'92s War militarized civil society and normalized emergency rule. The Salem trials showed how fear could overpower institutions. The Dominion of New England demonstrated how easily self-government could be dissolved by executive decree. The French and Indian War exposed the limits of accountability when decisions were made an ocean away. Each event left a mark: a lesson about how power behaved when unrestrained and how fragile the idea of consent could be.\
\
Information was tightly controlled, yet resistance found ways to circulate. Printing presses required licenses. Seditious libel laws punished unauthorized expression. Dissenting clergy and printers faced retaliation. Loyalist publishers were attacked; patriots were censored in turn. The idea of a free press existed in imagination long before it existed in practice. When newspapers flourished, it was often because they operated just beyond the reach of authority, testing the boundaries of permissible criticism.\
\
By the eighteenth century, colonial assemblies had gained experience but remained subordinate to governors and the Crown. Judges served at the pleasure of executives. Economic regulation favored imperial interests. Elections were narrow and shaped by property requirements, social pressure, and elite agreement. Ballots were cast in public, subject to coercion. Political participation was limited by design. The most basic democratic principle\'97that the governed should choose those who govern\'97was present more in rhetoric than in law.\
\
The Revolution illuminated contradictions rather than resolving them. Calls for liberty coexisted with the preservation of slavery. Demands for representation coexisted with the exclusion of most of the population. Revolutionary committees enforced loyalty through intimidation and confiscation. Property seizures blurred the distinction between justice and revenge. State constitutions expanded participation modestly but preserved elite dominance. Independence changed the sovereign but not the underlying structure of society. The habits of hierarchy endured.\
\
Yet the Revolution introduced a transformative idea: that legitimate authority originates in the people. It was a principle inconsistently applied but impossible to ignore. It created a conceptual space in which a more expansive democracy could eventually emerge. The Confederation period tested that principle through instability. Without a strong national government, states drifted toward factionalism, economic distress, and institutional fragility. Shays\'92 Rebellion revealed that weak legal structures and unequal economic power could undermine the legitimacy of self-government itself.\
\
The debates of 1787 were shaped as much by these lived experiences as by political theory. The framers approached the Constitution aware that unchecked authority could produce tyranny, but that fragmented authority could produce collapse. They sought a structure capable of balancing ambition with restraint, power with accountability, and national unity with local authority. They succeeded imperfectly. Many exclusions remained. Many injustices persisted. Yet the framework they created could evolve in ways they did not foresee.\
\
Through the lens of the Democracy Clock, the signing of the Constitution marks the end of an era shaped more by authoritarian inheritance than democratic practice. By 1787, fifty-seven of the sixty destabilizing traits were present to some degree, and several were deeply entrenched. Exclusion based on race, gender, property, and religion remained central. Surveillance, coercion, and militarization had not disappeared. Inequality was not remedied. The new republic began not near noon but in the long afternoon of a society that had only begun to imagine equality.\
\
The Constitution did not create democracy. It created the scaffolding from which democracy could eventually be built. It established institutions that could strengthen over time, even if they began weak. It allowed representation that could widen, even if it began narrow. It permitted rights that could expand, even if they began constrained. Most importantly, it embedded a principle that would reshape the nation across centuries: that government derives its authority from the people, not from inherited power.\
\
Seen this way, the end of the era is not a moment of triumph but a point of departure. The United States at ratification was neither democratic nor authoritarian in the modern sense. It was something more unstable: a republic with democratic potential and authoritarian structure existing side by side, each capable of shaping the future. The next two centuries would determine which would prevail.\
\
On the Democracy Clock, the state of the republic at the signing of the Constitution registers as 305 points\'975:05 p.m. A nation far from noon, far from midnight, standing at the threshold of a long contest between its ideals and its inheritance.\
