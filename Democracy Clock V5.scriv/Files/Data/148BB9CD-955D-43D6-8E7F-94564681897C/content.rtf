\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 35 shows a maturing pattern of authoritarian governance operating across law, welfare, and information. Immigration enforcement became both more brutal and more stratified: military-style ICE raids, lethal force, reopened prison units, and abusive detention conditions coexisted with a new million\uc0\u8209 dollar \'93Gold Card\'94 visa and six\u8209 figure H\u8209 1B fees, making status contingent on wealth and ideology. Executive power pressed past checks through emergency threats to seize local police, National Guard deployments in low\u8209 crime cities, an unauthorized strike off Venezuela, and defiance of statutory TikTok deadlines, even as courts sporadically blocked overreach. Public health and climate governance were hollowed out by purging vaccine experts, firing the CDC director, gutting EPA\'92s climate authority, and slashing Medicaid, CHIP, and labor protections. Simultaneously, the administration and allies disciplined media and memory: regulatory threats helped sideline Jimmy Kimmel, defamation suits harassed critical outlets, far\u8209 right violence data disappeared, and slavery exhibits were stripped from national parks. Courts, Congress, and civil society mounted partial resistance, but the Democracy Clock still edged 0.1 minutes toward nightfall, remaining at 7:58 p.m. in public time.\
