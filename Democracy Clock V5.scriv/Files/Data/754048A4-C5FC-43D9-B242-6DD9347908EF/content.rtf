\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 16 Appendix: Silence and Spectacle as Governance\
\
This week shows an administration accelerating a multi-front restructuring of the state toward personalized, loyalty-based rule, while courts and some state actors mount scattered but meaningful resistance. The heaviest pressures fall on civil service neutrality, media independence, immigration enforcement, and scientific/public health capacity. DOGE\'92s mass firings, new ease of dismissing probationary employees, EPA and NIH purges, and targeted removals at FEMA, NTSB, and HHS collectively hollow out expertise and replace it with ideological or patronage appointments. Simultaneously, the White House escalates its campaign against independent media\'97defunding NPR/PBS, dismantling USAGM/VOA, contracting OAN, and weaponizing the FCC against CBS\'97while Bondi rolls back press protections. Immigration policy becomes a central vector of authoritarian drift: massive ICE funding, deputized federal agents, constraints on releases, and high-profile arrests of a mayor and threats against members of Congress signal law as weapon, not limit. Yet federal courts in North Carolina, immigration cases, and the Perkins Coie ruling demonstrate that judicial checks remain partially functional, even as the Supreme Court greenlights the trans military ban and signals vulnerability to politicization.\
