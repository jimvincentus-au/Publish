\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 19, spanning 24\'9630 May 2025, records a draw on the Democracy Clock but not in the balance of power. The public time stays at 7:51 p.m., with only a 0.1\uc0\u8209 minute shift beneath the surface, because authoritarian pressure and institutional resistance rise together. The administration accelerates an exclusionary migration regime\'97ICE arrest quotas, the planned Office of Remigration, TPS and parole terminations, and punitive visa policies\'97while revoking humanitarian parole for a dying child and targeting Chinese students. Harvard becomes a test case as the White House strips foreign\u8209 student privileges and federal contracts, prompting injunctions and a broader academic backlash. Public media face retaliatory funding cuts even as the administration scrubs speech transcripts and curates the record. Crony capitalism and impunity deepen through Boeing\'92s non\u8209 prosecution deal, Trump\u8209 linked foreign projects, and pardons for corrupt allies. Lower courts, universities, public broadcasters, parents, and decentralized protest movements push back, but the Supreme Court and politicized agencies increasingly align with executive and corporate interests.\
