The sky is heavy and overcast, suggesting unease, and subtle American flags hang limp along the facade."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 5 of Trump\u2019s second term compressed a structural transformation of the American state into seven days. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:50 to 7:51 p.m., a 1.3\u2011minute shift that belied the depth of change. A Musk\u2011led Department of Government Efficiency emerged as a parallel power center, driving mass layoffs across health, safety, environmental, and foreign\u2011aid agencies while courts mostly declined to intervene. Executive orders froze congressionally appropriated funds, invited agencies to nullify regulations, and pulled independent regulators and the Postal Service toward direct White House control. The Justice Department coerced prosecutors to drop a corruption case, purged Biden\u2011appointed U.S. attorneys, and paired selective enforcement with mass pardons for January 6 attackers. Immigration and labor policy hardened into tiered systems of rights, while DOGE sought sweeping access to IRS, Social Security, and education data. Simultaneously, curricula, monuments, arts funding, and federal websites were scrubbed of DEI, Black history, and LGBTQ+ content. Protests, resignations, lawsuits, and a handful of court rulings signaled resistance, but the week\u2019s net effect was to normalize a government that serves power first.",
