\
The second week of Trump\'92s return to power reads less like the settling\uc0\u8209 in of a new administration and more like the opening phase of a coordinated campaign. The actions are varied on the surface\'97immigration raids in Chicago, a memo about federal grants, a renaming of the Gulf of Mexico\'97but they share a common aim: to move the center of gravity away from law, institutions, and shared facts, and toward the will of one leader and his circle. The Democracy Clock registers that shift. At the start of the week it stood at 7:45 p.m. By the end, it had jumped forward to 7:56 p.m., an eleven\u8209 minute lurch that reflects not a single shock but the cumulative effect of many blows, each aimed at a different pillar of democratic life.\
\
The previous week had already seen the first wave of orders and appointments. This week, the pattern hardened. The clock\'92s move from 7:45 to 7:56 p.m. captures three linked changes. First, executive power began to operate with far less effective oversight, as inspectors general and prosecutors were removed in clusters. Second, the law itself was bent into a shield for allies and a weapon against opponents, from blanket pardons for January 6 rioters to the closing of cases against Trump\'92s former co\uc0\u8209 defendants. Third, the neutral machinery of the state\'97civil servants, archives, research agencies, even the language on federal websites\'97was pulled into open political service. The eleven\u8209 minute jump is the system\'92s way of saying that these are not isolated abuses. They are structural moves that make future abuses easier and resistance harder.\
\
The most visible line of attack ran through the oversight system that is supposed to keep executive power in check. Over the course of the week, Trump fired or moved to fire at least seventeen inspectors general, including those at Defense, State, Health and Human Services, and other major departments. Some were dismissed by late\uc0\u8209 night email, others through letters that ignored a recent law requiring written reasons and thirty days\'92 notice to Congress. The firings were not tied to performance or scandal; they were tied to independence. The chair of the Council of Inspectors General warned that the actions likely violated the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022. Senators from both parties asked for explanations that did not come. In the trait table, the presence of \'93inspectors general are fired or ignored\'94 jumped sharply, and the difficulty of repair stayed high. Once watchdogs are removed and their offices chilled, it is not simple to rebuild a culture of fearless audit.\
\
The same logic of purge and replacement ran through the Justice Department and the FBI. Acting Attorney General James McHenry fired more than a dozen federal prosecutors who had worked on criminal cases against Trump, saying they could not be trusted to implement the president\'92s agenda. On the same theme, the department closed the case against Trump\'92s former co\uc0\u8209 defendants in the classified documents investigation. Reports then emerged of plans to fire FBI agents who had worked on January 6 and other Trump\u8209 related matters, followed by actual staff cuts that hit at least five top FBI officials and dozens of agents. The FBI Agents Association warned that these moves would undermine national security and criminal enforcement. In the Democracy Clock\'92s language, \'93law is a weapon, not a limit\'94 and \'93elite donor crimes concealed, not prosecuted\'94 both moved toward midnight. The law was not being abolished; it was being repurposed, so that some people would live under it and others above it.\
\
The pardons and commutations for January 6 rioters formed the moral backdrop to this legal reshaping. Trump had already issued a blanket pardon or commutation for roughly 1,500 people involved in the Capitol attack. This week, Vice\uc0\u8209 President JD Vance defended those pardons as a correction of supposed due\u8209 process abuses, even as Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called them a mistake that could incite more violence. One rioter, Jason Riddle, publicly rejected his pardon, saying his actions were \'93not pardonable,\'94 while another, Andrew Taake, walked free from his insurrection sentence only to remain a fugitive on an older charge of soliciting a minor. A third, Emily Hernandez, who had been pardoned for her role in January 6, received a ten\u8209 year sentence for a drunk\u8209 driving crash that killed a woman and injured her husband. The pattern is not that all pardoned rioters reoffended; it is that the state\'92s response to an attack on its own legislature was recast as mercy for \'93patriots,\'94 while the machinery of prosecution was turned toward other targets.\
\
If oversight and law were being bent, the civil service was being hollowed out. The Office of Personnel Management, now under the influence of Elon Musk\'92s team, sent nearly three million federal workers an email titled \'93Fork in the Road.\'94 It offered them a \'93deferred resignation\'94 effective September 30, 2025, with the suggestion that they could keep their pay while avoiding in\uc0\u8209 person work. The fine print, revealed in an OPM memo, made clear that administrative leave was not guaranteed and would depend on agency discretion. In parallel, another message offered buyouts to almost all federal employees, urging them to resign by early February. Senator Tim Kaine took to the Senate floor to warn that the offer was a trap that could leave workers jobless and without promised benefits. At the same time, OPM issued guidance on a new \'93Schedule Policy/Career\'94 category that would strip tens of thousands of civil servants of their protections and make them easier to fire for disloyalty. The trait \'93civil service politicized or privatized\'94 rose accordingly. The goal was not simply to shrink government; it was to replace a nonpartisan bureaucracy with a loyal one.\
\
These moves were reinforced by targeted attacks on specific agencies. USAID leadership was accused of trying to circumvent the foreign\uc0\u8209 aid freeze and dozens of career officials were placed on administrative leave. The National Labor Relations Board\'92s chair, Gwynne Wilcox, and its general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, were fired, leaving the agency without a quorum and unable to issue major decisions. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, the directors of the Center for Women Veterans and the Center for Minority Veterans were dismissed. Each of these actions could be defended on narrow grounds, but together they point to a strategy: disable or capture the parts of government that protect workers, regulate employers, or serve marginalized groups, while leaving intact those that enforce order or move money.\
\
Immigration policy became the sharpest edge of this new alignment between security forces and executive power. Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, normalizing a state of exception that allows the reallocation of funds and the deployment of troops. Kristi Noem, newly confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security, appeared in tactical gear in New York and promised to \'93remove criminals from the streets.\'94 ICE launched raids in Chicago and other cities, with quotas set at 75 arrests per day in one operation and 1,800 per day nationwide by \'93deportation czar\'94 Tom Homan. Raids reached into homes, workplaces, and, under a new DHS order, churches and schools\'97spaces that had previously been treated as sensitive. In Milwaukee, ICE agents arrested a three\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old child, his mother, and grandmother, all U.S. citizens, before releasing them with an apology. In Colorado, Buckley Space Force Base opened its gates to ICE as a staging and detention site, blurring the line between military and immigration enforcement. The trait \'93security forces protect power, not people\'94 moved sharply upward, as did \'93surveillance of citizens increases; elite crimes opaque.\'94\
\
The administration\'92s immigration agenda extended beyond enforcement to detention and status itself. Trump signed an executive order to prepare a facility at Guant\'e1namo Bay capable of holding up to 30,000 migrants, explicitly linking them in rhetoric to \'93the worst criminal illegal aliens.\'94 Another order, the Laken Riley Act, mandated detention for undocumented immigrants charged\'97not convicted\'97with theft\uc0\u8209 related crimes and gave state attorneys general the right to sue the federal government for perceived lax enforcement. A separate order allowed ICE to enter schools and churches, and yet another sought to deport international students who had taken part in pro\u8209 Palestinian campus protests. On his first day in office, Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented parents. A federal judge in Seattle called the order \'93blatantly unconstitutional\'94 and issued a temporary block, and a coalition of twenty\u8209 two state attorneys general filed suit. For now, the courts held the line on citizenship, but the attempt itself signaled a willingness to redraw the basic boundary of belonging.\
\
The same impulse to redefine who counts as fully human and fully protected appeared in orders targeting transgender people. An executive order titled \'93Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\'94 barred individuals whose gender identity diverged from their \'93biological sex\'94 from serving in the armed forces, revoking prior policies that had allowed service by people with gender dysphoria. Another order, \'93Restoring America\'92s Fighting Force,\'94 abolished diversity, equity, and inclusion offices in the Defense Department and Homeland Security, and banned the teaching of certain \'93divisive concepts\'94 in military education. A third, \'93Protecting Children From Chemical And Surgical Mutilation,\'94 cut off federal funding for gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care for minors and ordered agencies to rescind policies based on professional medical guidance. In federal prisons, a separate order \'93defending women from gender ideology extremism\'94 led to transgender women being isolated, transferred to men\'92s facilities, and cut off from hormone treatments. Legal advocates sued, and one transfer was temporarily blocked, but the trait table recorded a rise in \'93dissent reframed as disorder or treason\'94 and \'93civic education hollowed out,\'94 because these orders did more than change policy. They taught the public that certain identities are suspect and that expertise can be brushed aside when it conflicts with ideology.\
\
Education more broadly became a battlefield. Trump signed \'93Ending Radical Indoctrination in K\uc0\u8209 12 Schooling,\'94 directing federal agencies to cut funding for schools that promote what the order called \'93discriminatory equity ideology\'94 and to \'93protect parental rights.\'94 A companion order on \'93Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families\'94 pushed federal funds toward private and faith\u8209 based schools. Another order threatened to cut federal funding from schools that teach about \'93critical race theory\'94 or \'93gender ideology.\'94 At the same time, the State Department\'92s Foreign Service Institute suspended more than 2,100 DEI\u8209 related training items, and the Air Force removed lessons on the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots from its training materials. The IRS, under direction from the White House, deleted references to \'93diversity,\'94 \'93equity,\'94 and \'93inclusion\'94 from its procedural handbook and set up a tip line for employees to report colleagues involved in DEI work. The Department of Agriculture was ordered to take down websites that referenced the climate crisis, including tools used by the Forest Service to plan for fires and drought. These were not just policy reversals; they were acts of erasure. The traits \'93textbooks and museums altered to erase dissent,\'94 \'93government archives sanitized,\'94 and \'93memory curated by power\'94 all moved toward midnight.\
\
The funding freeze was the week\'92s clearest example of chaos as a deliberate strategy. On January 27, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo freezing all federal grants, loans, and financial assistance, pending a review of \'93illegal DEI programs\'94 and clean energy spending. The freeze hit everything from Medicaid portals, which went down in all fifty states, to Meals on Wheels, to local law enforcement grants. Non\uc0\u8209 profits and states sued, arguing that the freeze violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and usurped Congress\'92s power of the purse. A federal judge issued an administrative stay, then an injunction, halting the freeze and warning of irreparable harm if funds were withheld. OMB then rescinded its memo, but the White House press secretary insisted in a briefing that the cuts were still in effect. Another memo, reported by multiple outlets, directed agencies to freeze all financial assistance until OMB could approve each program individually. The trait \'93chaos as strategy to disable accountability\'94 rose because the point of such conflicting signals is not efficient governance. It is to keep courts, states, and citizens off balance, unsure which rules apply and who is in charge.\
\
Even as the courts pushed back on the funding freeze and birthright citizenship, other judicial developments favored the powerful. A federal judge rescinded an order barring Stewart Rhodes, the former Oath Keepers leader, from entering Washington, D.C., after Trump commuted his sentence. The conditions of supervised release were effectively voided. On the same day, the Trump administration closed the case against his former co\uc0\u8209 defendants in the classified documents matter. In Louisiana, by contrast, a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter, was indicted for prescribing abortion pills online to a minor, one of the first cross\u8209 state criminal prosecutions of a doctor for providing abortion care after Roe\'92s fall. The sentencing of former Senator Bob Menendez to eleven years for bribery showed that some elite corruption still meets with serious punishment, but the trait table weighed that against the pattern of pardons, dropped cases, and politicized appointments. The net movement for \'93courts rule for donors and elites\'94 and \'93judicial independence eroded\'94 was toward greater risk.\
\
Appointments and confirmations filled out the picture of a government increasingly staffed for loyalty. Kristi Noem at Homeland Security and Pete Hegseth at Defense had already been confirmed. This week, Scott Bessent was confirmed as Treasury Secretary after promising to extend the 2017 tax cuts that heavily favored the wealthy. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nominated to lead Health and Human Services, faced a series of contentious hearings in which senators pressed him on his history of anti\uc0\u8209 vaccine rhetoric and his sudden alignment with Trump\'92s anti\u8209 abortion stance. He promised to resign from his anti\u8209 vaccine nonprofit if confirmed, but public health experts warned that his presence at HHS could undermine vaccine policy and trust. Kash Patel, nominated as FBI director, refused to clearly rule out investigating Trump\'92s political opponents and was questioned about his role in the classified documents case, where he had initially invoked the Fifth Amendment. Tulsi Gabbard, nominated as director of national intelligence, struggled to reassure senators about her past praise for foreign strongmen and her support for Edward Snowden. Senate Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Russell Vought\'92s nomination to run OMB, but Republicans advanced him anyway. The trait \'93appointments awarded by loyalty and wealth\'94 rose because these choices signaled that ideological alignment and personal loyalty mattered more than experience or independence.\
\
The week also showed how public tragedy could be folded into this project. An American Eagle flight and a U.S. Army helicopter collided over the Potomac River, killing all sixty\uc0\u8209 seven people on board. Trump responded by blaming diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration, claiming that prior administrations had lowered standards to favor \'93politics over safety.\'94 He signed an executive order on FAA staffing that framed his changes as a return to \'93merit\u8209 based recruitment\'94 and rolled back DEI efforts. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a memo prioritizing grants for communities with higher marriage and birth rates, tying infrastructure funding to demographic behavior. In the Democracy Clock\'92s terms, this was not just a policy debate about hiring. It was an example of crisis being used to justify ideological purges and to reward communities that fit a preferred social model.\
\
Internationally, the administration\'92s choices reinforced the sense that foreign policy and personal interest were entwined. Trump lifted Biden\'92s hold on 2,000\uc0\u8209 pound bomb shipments to Israel and invited Benjamin Netanyahu, under indictment by the International Criminal Court, to be the first foreign leader to visit the White House. He and his son\u8209 in\u8209 law Jared Kushner discussed plans to redevelop Gaza as a luxury resort once Palestinians were relocated, while Kushner\'92s private equity fund stood to benefit from such projects. Trump spoke openly of moving up to 1.5 or 2.2 million Palestinians out of Gaza, a policy that human rights law would recognize as ethnic cleansing. In a separate dispute, he launched a trade war with Colombia over deportation flights, imposing 25 percent tariffs on Colombian exports, revoking visas for Colombian officials, and canceling visa appointments at the U.S. embassy. Colombia threatened retaliatory tariffs on U.S. corn. These moves pushed the traits \'93policy driven by elite lobbying and money,\'94 \'93crony capitalism indistinguishable from governance,\'94 and \'93global democracy weakened\'94 further toward midnight.\
\
Against this backdrop, there were pockets of resistance and repair. Federal judges blocked the funding freeze and the birthright citizenship order, at least temporarily. Disability Rights Oregon sued Grants Pass over anti\uc0\u8209 camping rules that left unhoused people with no legal way to survive. A federal court kept the Flathead Warming Center in Kalispell open despite the city council\'92s attempt to close it. Quaker congregations and other religious groups sued DHS over ICE raids in churches, arguing that the policy violated religious freedom. Activists in North Carolina organized to defend Justice Alison Riggs\'92s election against a judge\'92s attempt to throw out votes. Siembra NC built \'93ICE watch\'94 programs to protect undocumented neighbors. A union representing 5,000 NIH researchers demanded bargaining over the funding freeze and communications blackout. Illinois\'92s governor banned January 6 participants from state employment. These actions did not move the clock back this week, but they mattered in another way: they showed that the moral floor had not collapsed everywhere at once.\
\
Still, the moral ledger for the week is stark. Character, in the sense of a basic commitment to serve the public rather than oneself, was eroded by the mass firings of watchdogs, the use of Guant\'e1namo for migrants, and the intertwining of foreign policy with private profit. Ethics were compromised as law was used to shield allies and target abortion providers, while public tragedies became occasions for deregulation and blame\uc0\u8209 shifting. Restraint gave way to normalized emergency powers, militarized immigration enforcement, and the use of the military in domestic detention. Truthfulness suffered as federal websites were scrubbed, climate and DEI information removed, and false claims about crime, Gaza funding, and aviation safety spread from the podium. Good faith in governance was undermined by the dismantling of DEI, the targeting of immigrants in churches and schools, and the bad\u8209 faith use of funding freezes to attack Congress\'92s role. Stewardship of institutions and history faltered as archives were sanitized, civil servants pushed out, and national memory curated to flatter the regime.\
\
Looking ahead, several fault lines are already in motion. Courts will have to decide whether the funding freeze, even in its rescinded form, violated the Impoundment Control Act, and whether the administration can lawfully condition grants on ideological criteria. Lawsuits over birthright citizenship, fast\uc0\u8209 track deportations, ICE raids in churches, and the treatment of transgender prisoners will test the resilience of constitutional protections. Senate votes on RFK Jr., Kash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard, and Russell Vought will determine whether key agencies are led by loyalists or by figures with at least some distance from the president. The planned expansion of migrant detention at Guant\'e1namo, the use of military bases for immigration enforcement, and the trade war with Colombia will shape both domestic rights and international alliances. None of these are hypothetical risks; they are scheduled hearings, pending rulings, and announced policies.\
\
By the end of the week, with the clock fixed at 7:56 p.m., the pattern is clear. This is not yet a midnight where elections are canceled and opposition banned. It is a twilight in which elections still occur, courts still issue injunctions, and protests still gather, but the ground under all of them is being quietly cut away. Oversight is weaker, law more pliable, the civil service more afraid, the information environment more curated, and the line between security and politics more blurred. The eleven\uc0\u8209 minute jump captures that acceleration. Each minute represents not just a measure of risk, but a shrinking margin for repair. If future weeks follow the template of this one\'97purge, decree, confusion, partial judicial check, then renewed push\'97the space in which democratic actors can still act will narrow further. For now, the record stands: Week 2 ends at 7:56 p.m., in a country where the forms of democracy remain, but their moral and institutional foundations have been visibly, deliberately weakened.\
\
## Week 2 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Donald Trump commuted or pardoned sentences of January 6 Capitol attackers (2025-01-26): Trump\'92s mass clemency for roughly 1,500 January 6 offenders weakened accountability for an attack on the transfer of power and signaled tolerance for pro\uc0\u8209 regime political violence.\
\
2. President Donald Trump pardoned Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes (2025-01-25): Pardoning Stewart Rhodes, convicted of seditious conspiracy, undercut consequences for organizing violent resistance to election results and emboldened extremist allies.\
\
3. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency at the southern border and reversed prior immigration policies (2025-01-26): Declaring a border emergency and expanding enforcement powers, including arrests in schools and churches, normalized emergency tools for ideological immigration crackdowns.\
\
4. President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to target undocumented immigrants (2025-01-28): Invoking the Alien Enemies Act against undocumented immigrants, based on misleading crime claims, expanded discretionary power to label residents as security threats and justify harsh measures.\
\
5. President Donald Trump ordered opening of a 30,000\uc0\u8209 person migrant detention center at Guant\'e1namo Bay (2025-01-30): Directing the Pentagon and DHS to prepare Guant\'e1namo for mass migrant detention blurred lines between immigration control and wartime detention, raising due\u8209 process and human\u8209 rights concerns.\
\
6. President Donald Trump issued executive orders dismantling federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and affirmative action (2025-01-25): Eliminating DEI and affirmative action across the federal government rolled back decades of anti\uc0\u8209 discrimination policy and reoriented state power away from protecting marginalized groups.\
\
7. President Donald Trump disbanded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2025-01-25): Abolishing the EEOC removed a central federal mechanism for enforcing workplace anti\uc0\u8209 discrimination laws, weakening legal recourse for workers facing bias.\
\
8. President Donald Trump froze federal grants, loans, and financial assistance nationwide pending ideological review (2025-01-27): Ordering a sweeping freeze of congressionally appropriated grants and loans to purge disfavored programs tested executive control over the purse and disrupted core public services.\
\
9. Office of Management and Budget under President Trump rescinded the memo freezing federal funding after judicial and public pushback (2025-01-29): Rescinding the funding freeze memo under pressure showed that courts and public backlash can still constrain aggressive executive attempts to control appropriations.\
\
10. President Donald Trump fired 15\'9618 federal inspectors general and other independent watchdogs without required notice (2025-01-27): Mass firings of inspectors general across key departments, without statutory notice, gutted independent oversight and signaled intolerance for internal scrutiny.\
\
11. President Donald Trump ordered dismissal of NLRB and EEOC Democratic members before their terms expired (2025-01-30): Removing sitting NLRB and EEOC members appointed by prior presidents undermined statutory protections for independent labor regulators and concentrated power over workplace rules.\
\
12. President Donald Trump issued executive orders stripping civil servants of protections and creating Schedule Policy/Career (2025-01-30): Redesigning civil\uc0\u8209 service rules to ease firing and require loyalty shifted the federal workforce from merit\u8209 based administration toward political patronage.\
\
13. White House personnel teams under President Trump screened agency job applicants for loyalty to the president (2025-01-25): Sending loyalty\uc0\u8209 screening teams into agencies politicized hiring for career roles, weakening the norm of a neutral civil service.\
\
14. President Donald Trump ordered mass resignation offers and buyouts to federal employees (2025-01-29): Offering deferred resignations and inducements to millions of federal workers, with implied threats of layoffs, pressured non\uc0\u8209 loyal staff to leave and opened space for loyalist replacements.\
\
15. President Donald Trump signed executive orders banning transgender military service and abolishing military DEI programs (2025-01-27): Banning transgender enlistment and dismantling DEI in the armed forces narrowed who may serve and aligned military culture with exclusionary ideology.\
\
16. President Donald Trump issued executive orders restricting gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care for minors and in federal programs (2025-01-28): Cutting federal funding and coverage for gender\u8209 affirming care for youth and dependents used state power to constrain medical decisions for a targeted minority group.\
\
17. President Donald Trump issued an executive order transferring transgender women in federal prisons to men\'92s facilities and halting their treatment (2025-01-30): Reassigning trans women to men\'92s prisons and ending gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care in custody exposed a vulnerable group to heightened risk and challenged constitutional protections against cruel treatment.\
\
18. President Donald Trump ended or sought to end birthright citizenship by executive order (2025-01-28): Attempting to revoke birthright citizenship by decree directly challenged the Fourteenth Amendment and threatened to create a hereditary underclass of non\uc0\u8209 citizens.\
\
19. President Donald Trump rescinded deportation protections and Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans (2025-01-29): Revoking TPS and other protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans exposed them to deportation despite ongoing instability, signaling a more stratified approach to humanitarian status.\
\
20. President Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act expanding mandatory detention and state standing on immigration enforcement (2025-01-29): Enacting the Laken Riley Act broadened mandatory detention for accused immigrants and empowered states to sue over federal enforcement, tightening punitive immigration policy.\
\
21. President Donald Trump ordered ICE to conduct raids in schools, churches, hospitals, and other sensitive locations (2025-01-26): Authorizing immigration arrests in previously protected spaces like schools and churches eroded long\uc0\u8209 standing humanitarian limits on enforcement and increased fear among targeted communities.\
\
22. President Donald Trump directed ICE to dramatically increase daily arrest quotas (2025-01-26): Imposing high arrest quotas on ICE prioritized numerical targets over individualized judgment, heightening risks of rights violations in immigration enforcement.\
\
23. President Donald Trump ordered deportation flights to Colombia to resume and used tariffs and visa sanctions to compel compliance (2025-01-28): Tying deportation flights to punitive tariffs and visa revocations leveraged economic and diplomatic pressure to enforce U.S. migration policy abroad.\
\
24. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accords and the World Health Organization (2025-01-26): Leaving the Paris agreement and WHO reduced U.S. participation in global climate and health governance, weakening cooperative responses to transnational threats.\
\
25. President Donald Trump halted almost all foreign aid except military assistance to select allies (2025-01-25): Freezing congressionally appropriated foreign aid while preserving military assistance to favored states reoriented U.S. leverage abroad and sidestepped legislative budget authority.\
\
26. President Donald Trump demanded NATO allies raise military spending to 5 percent of GDP (2025-01-25): Pressuring NATO members to sharply increase defense spending risked destabilizing the alliance and reframed security cooperation around unilateral U.S. demands.\
\
27. President Donald Trump directed resumption of large bomb shipments to Israel (2025-01-25): Lifting holds on heavy munitions to Israel reversed prior constraints on its Gaza operations and signaled a more permissive U.S. stance toward regional military escalation.\
\
28. President Donald Trump proposed relocating Gaza\'92s population to other countries (2025-01-25): Advocating mass relocation of Gazans to neighboring states disregarded self\uc0\u8209 determination norms and suggested support for demographic engineering as a policy tool.\
\
29. President Donald Trump issued executive orders declaring an energy emergency and diverting California water from environmental protections (2025-01-26): Using emergency framing to roll back appliance standards and override California\'92s water policies subordinated environmental safeguards and state authority to centralized executive preferences.\
\
30. President Donald Trump paused approvals for renewable energy projects on public lands and waters (2025-01-28): Blocking new wind and solar approvals on federal lands slowed the energy transition and favored incumbent fossil\uc0\u8209 fuel interests.\
\
31. President Donald Trump signed an executive order eliminating federal AI safety oversight (2025-01-28): Removing federal\uc0\u8209 level AI safety concerns prioritized rapid deployment over risk management, leaving powerful technologies with fewer public safeguards.\
\
32. President Donald Trump froze NIH funding and imposed new restrictions on health research programs (2025-01-30): Halting and constraining NIH funding disrupted ongoing medical research and signaled willingness to use health grants as leverage over scientific agendas.\
\
33. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on FAA staffing blaming prior diversity policies for a fatal crash (2025-01-31): Recasting FAA hiring around \'93merit\'94 while blaming diversity initiatives for a disaster politicized safety regulation and targeted inclusion programs without evidence.\
\
34. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (2025-01-31): Requiring repeal of at least ten regulations for every new one and imposing a negative cost cap reoriented federal rulemaking toward aggressive deregulation regardless of public benefits.\
\
35. President Donald Trump ordered removal of DEI language from IRS and other federal documents and created a DEI tip line (2025-01-31): Scrubbing DEI references from official materials and inviting reports on such content institutionalized hostility to equity efforts and altered the government\'92s own record of inequality.\
\
36. President Donald Trump ordered USDA to remove climate\uc0\u8209 crisis content from agency websites (2025-01-31): Forcing USDA to unpublish climate\u8209 related pages restricted public access to scientific information and sanitized records of environmental risk.\
\
37. President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America (2025-01-29): Renaming a major body of water by executive fiat used symbolic power to assert nationalist branding over shared geography, despite broad public opposition.\
