Week 25 of Trump’s second term marks a shift from episodic abuses to an integrated system of control. The Democracy Clock jumps 6.2 minutes, from 10:58 p.m. to 11:04 p.m., driven by converging moves in law, bureaucracy, force, and information. The Supreme Court expands presidential immunity, narrows nationwide injunctions, and clears mass civil-service purges, while upholding harsh deportation regimes. The executive leans on emergency powers for war and tariffs, threatens federal takeovers of disfavored cities, and politicizes national security and diplomacy through loyalty-based appointments and sweeping layoffs. Immigration enforcement becomes openly militarized, with National Guard and Marines in raids, squalid detention, and dismantled DHS oversight. A sprawling budget law locks in tax cuts for the wealthy, slashes Medicaid and food aid, and supercharges enforcement budgets, even as AI firms and media platforms deepen their grip on education and economic narratives. Pockets of resistance—judges blocking birthright changes, doctors and advocates suing, lawmakers demanding files—persist, but operate inside a landscape increasingly engineered to favor impunity at the top and precarity below.
