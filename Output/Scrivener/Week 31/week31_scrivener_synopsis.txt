Week 31 of Trump’s second term registered only a 0.2‑minute shift on the Democracy Clock, from 8:06 to 8:07 p.m., but the movement masked a deeper consolidation. In Washington, D.C., a manufactured crime “emergency” justified federalizing the local police, importing armed National Guard units, embedding military lawyers in civilian courts, and ordering prosecutors to seek maximum charges while relaxing some gun laws. Similar logics spread outward: immigration and visa systems became instruments of ideological sorting and fear, with continuous vetting of 55 million visa holders, mass student visa revocations, TPS rollbacks, and militarized, outsourced deportation infrastructure. Law was wielded to pardon January 6 offenders, pressure courts over loyal election criminals, impanel grand juries on debunked “treason” theories, and selectively manage Epstein records. Elections were re‑engineered through partisan maps, attacks on mail voting, and new registration hurdles. Meanwhile, unions, data guardians, climate and vaccine science, and even Smithsonian exhibits came under pressure to align with regime narratives. Courts, civil servants, and activists mounted important but fragmented resistance.
