    "square": "A symbolic still life in 1:1 format: a brass desk clock frozen at 8:08 sits atop a stack of redacted legal files stamped \"classified\" beside a gavel tipped on its side. A National Guard helmet and a folded federal worker pay stub marked \"furloughed\" rest nearby. In the background, a muted television screen shows a blurred podium with an indistinct figure, and a small American flag droops from the edge of the table. The lighting is moody and realistic, emphasizing paper textures, metal, and cloth, evoking quiet erosion of law and labor protections.",
    "wide": "A dusk cityscape of downtown Chicago blending into Portland streets, seen from above in cinematic 16:9. Federal agents in dark tactical gear and National Guard troops stand at intersections, their silhouettes backlit by police lights and the glow of shuttered government buildings. Protesters with signs are corralled behind metal barricades, journalists with cameras pushed to the margins. In the sky, a large, faint clock face hovers at 8:08, its minute hand barely shifted, while distant Capitol and courthouse domes recede into haze, suggesting weakened oversight. The mood is tense, realistic, painterly, with rich shadows and reflections on wet pavement."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 38 of Trump\u2019s second term saw the Democracy Clock hold at 8:08 p.m., moving only a tenth of a minute while underlying structures shifted. Immigration enforcement in Chicago and Portland became a pretext for militarized federal presence, with ICE agents using battlefield tactics against protesters and journalists and National Guard units deployed into Democratic-led cities over local objections. Governors and judges in Illinois, Oregon, and California fought back, winning partial limits on deployments and protest policing, yet enforcement and detention expanded as oversight offices were furloughed and controversial facilities like Alligator Alcatraz stayed open on fresh federal money.\n\nIn Washington, the Justice Department and FBI were further repurposed: anti-corruption units were gutted, the Homan bribery probe was closed, and Trump critics James Comey and Letitia James were indicted while elite-linked cases like the Epstein files remained shrouded. The shutdown became an instrument of partisan restructuring, as OMB canceled projects in Democratic areas and cast doubt on back pay for furloughed workers. Simultaneously, the White House tightened information control, promoted vaccine misinformation, and elevated Trump-centric symbols, even as civil society, professional associations, and scattered courts mounted reactive resistance.",
