# Week 26 Appendix: Loyalty as Operating System

This was an exceptionally heavy week of structural pressure toward authoritarianism, centered on three converging fronts: weaponization of the immigration and security apparatus, politicization and hollowing-out of the civil service and justice system, and a coordinated squeeze on independent information and public goods. ICE and DHS policies—ending bond hearings, rapid deportations, data-sharing from Medicaid and IRS, raids at workplaces and schools, and abusive detention conditions—push hard against due process, equal citizenship, and the idea that security forces protect people rather than power. Simultaneously, Schedule G, mass layoffs and purges at Education, State, DOJ, NIH, and VA, plus politicized judicial nominations and firings of ethics and prosecutorial officials, entrench a loyalty-based state and erode rule-of-law guardrails. Congress largely ratified executive priorities via the rescissions package defunding public broadcasting and foreign aid, while the Supreme Court’s emergency stay on Education layoffs and Florida’s voting-rights decision deepen institutional complicity. Information control appears in NASA climate suppression, BLS data degradation, Epstein-file opacity, and attacks on public media and critical outlets. There are countervailing sparks—courts blocking some refugee and TPS rollbacks, bipartisan pushes for Epstein transparency, robust protest and local violence-prevention innovations—but they are outweighed by systemic centralization of power and degradation of neutral institutions.

Week 26 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Donald Trump authorized ICE agents to use whatever means necessary for self-protection and ordered arrests of protesters who impeded raids (2025-07-12): Trump’s directive expanded permissible force and arrests during immigration operations, signaling willingness to use federal power aggressively against protesters and communities targeted by enforcement.

2. President Donald Trump announced 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico (2025-07-12): The steep unilateral tariffs reoriented U.S. trade policy toward confrontation, with potential knock-on effects for domestic prices, alliances, and the economic context in which voters assess government performance.

3. President Donald Trump claimed he was considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship (2025-07-12): Trump’s threat to strip a critic’s citizenship, though legally baseless, normalized rhetoric about using state power to punish dissenters and blur constitutional protections of birthright citizenship.

4. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem required her prior approval for FEMA expenditures or contracts of $100,000 or more (2025-07-12): Centralizing sign-off for mid-sized FEMA spending in the secretary’s office risked slowing disaster response and concentrated operational discretion over life-saving aid in a single political appointee.

5. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declined to renew FEMA call center contracts after Texas floods (2025-07-13): Allowing FEMA’s call-handling capacity to collapse during an active disaster weakened federal protection for affected residents and illustrated how executive choices can degrade core public safety functions.

6. Trump administration canceled a Biden-era civil rights settlement requiring Alabama to address Lowndes County sewage crisis (2025-07-13): Terminating the sanitation settlement removed federal pressure to remedy environmental injustice in a poor, largely Black community, signaling reduced federal commitment to using civil rights tools for basic public health.

7. Trump administration implemented mass layoffs at the State Department and closed the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (2025-07-11): Eliminating over 1,300 State Department jobs and shuttering a key human rights bureau weakened U.S. diplomatic capacity and its institutional commitment to promoting democracy abroad.

8. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the Justice Department to dismiss charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore over destroyed Covid vaccines and fake cards (2025-07-12): Dropping a high-profile pandemic fraud case mid-trial suggested political interference in prosecutorial decisions and signaled tolerance for conduct that undermined public health mandates.

9. President Donald Trump announced plans to increase ICE officers and detention facilities to drive undocumented immigrants out of the U.S. (2025-07-15): Expanding ICE personnel and detention capacity entrenched a more punitive immigration regime, increasing the state’s coercive reach over noncitizens and mixed-status communities.

10. Trump administration ordered the destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2025-07-15): Incinerating U.S.-funded child nutrition aid on security grounds prioritized a hardline posture over humanitarian obligations, undermining America’s moral standing and soft power.

11.

15. Department of Veterans Affairs leadership ended gender-affirming medical care for transgender veterans pursuant to a Trump executive order (2025-07-18): Terminating gender-affirming care for trans veterans withdrew a previously available health service from a vulnerable group, using executive authority to narrow equal access to public healthcare.

16. Department of Veterans Affairs leadership removed anti-discrimination language on marital status and political views from hospital bylaws (2025-07-18): Deleting explicit protections against discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation at VA hospitals opened space for viewpoint-based or status-based bias in veterans’ access to care.

17. President Donald Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release Epstein grand jury testimony (2025-07-18): Directing selective release of grand jury material showed the president personally steering disclosure in a politically charged case, blending legal process with factional pressure from his base.

18. Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans advanced Emil Bove’s appeals court nomination despite a Democratic walkout and whistleblower concerns (2025-07-17): Pushing Bove’s nomination forward without hearing a whistleblower who alleged he urged ignoring court orders underscored partisan control over judicial vetting and reduced incentives to investigate misconduct claims.

19.
