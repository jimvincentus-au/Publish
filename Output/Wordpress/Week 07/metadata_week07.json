In the background, an American flag is slightly out of focus and a filing cabinet drawer stands ajar. Painterly, realistic style, dramatic side lighting and deep shadows.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene inside a vast government office complex, rows of empty cubicles with dark computer screens stretching into the distance, a few lit offices high above where suited figures confer over glowing maps and financial charts. In the foreground, a large wall clock shows 7:52, its glass face intact while fine cracks spider through the walls around it. Outside the windows, faint silhouettes of protesters and courthouse columns are visible, separated by reflective glass. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors with sharp highlights on screens and clock."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 7 of Trump\u2019s second term registered only a half\u2011minute shift on the Democracy Clock, holding at 7:52 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked a deepening of habits. The administration widened unilateral control over foreign aid and cyber posture, bypassing Congress on a $4 billion emergency arms sale to Israel, attempting to impound Ukraine aid, and ordering Cyber Command to stand down against Russia. Courts forced compliance on spending and some firings, yet impeachment threats and targeted executive orders against judges, law firms, and prosecutors signaled growing hostility to legal limits. Inside the state, mass layoffs, buyouts, and loyalist appointments hollowed Education, Social Security, VA, CFPB, USPS, and foreign\u2011aid bodies, shifting capacity toward privatization and patronage. A new crypto reserve, halted anti\u2013money laundering rules, and a quashed fraud case fused public policy with donor enrichment. Immigration crackdowns, anti\u2011DEI offensives, and campus funding threats hardened hierarchies of belonging and speech. Information channels and archives were curated to fit regime narratives. Resistance from courts, inspectors, universities, and street protests slowed but did not reverse the drift.",
