Power and Authority

1. President Trump authorized the US military to control federal land at the southern border for immigration enforcement (2025-04-12): By assigning the military jurisdiction over federal border lands and detention authority for migrants, the president expanded direct military involvement in domestic immigration enforcement, blurring civilian–military lines and concentrating coercive power in the executive.

President Trump announced a new at-will firing regime and mass staff reductions at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2025-04-17): Moving to fire nearly 90% of CFPB staff under a court-limited authority to shrink the agency used executive power to hollow out a key consumer watchdog while formally preserving its shell.

25. Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants to El Salvador’s mega-prison despite court injunctions (2025-04-16): Continuing deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in defiance of injunctions and without individualized evidence turned an old statute into a tool for mass, extra-territorial detention beyond normal judicial oversight.

32. Trump administration announced plans to cut or consolidate major public health programs into a new super-agency (2025-04-16): Planning to fold and slash health programs into an “Administration for a Healthy America” would centralize control over disease prevention and health data, potentially weakening specialized expertise and oversight.
