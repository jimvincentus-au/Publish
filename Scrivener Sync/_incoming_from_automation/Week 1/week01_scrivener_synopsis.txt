Week 1 of Trump’s second term opened with a torrent of executive action rather than a single constitutional rupture. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:31 p.m., but only because the terrain being seized—emergency powers, politicized justice, crony enrichment, curated memory—was already dangerously elevated. Trump pardoned or commuted roughly 1,500 January 6 offenders and other ideological allies, signaling that violence and loyalty could outweigh law. Sweeping immigration orders declared a border “emergency,” militarized enforcement, dismantled humanitarian pathways, and directly challenged birthright citizenship, prompting rapid but fragile judicial resistance. Inside the state, civil servants, inspectors general, and DEI offices were purged, independent regulators pulled into the White House orbit, and a new DOGE unit, fronted by Elon Musk, embedded presidential loyalists across agencies. Health and science communications were blacked out, climate and public health commitments abandoned, and intimate rights for women and LGBTQ+ people narrowed. Courts, states, unions, and civil society pushed back, but the week’s deeper meaning lay in how quickly abnormal tools were normalized.
