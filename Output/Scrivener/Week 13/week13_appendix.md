# Week 13 Appendix: Law as Instrument, Not Limit

This week is a concentrated stress test of constitutional democracy, with the executive branch openly contesting judicial authority, weaponizing federal power against perceived enemies, and fusing policy with personal and partisan gain. The most acute structural pressure falls on the rule of law and separation of powers: the Abrego García and Alien Enemies Act cases show systematic defiance of court orders, attempts to evade contempt, and a theory of foreign-affairs immunity that would place deportations beyond judicial reach. Simultaneously, civil and political rights are narrowed through proof-of-citizenship voting rules, aggressive immigration enforcement against students and activists, and a coordinated anti-trans and anti-DEI campaign that uses funding threats against states and universities. Economic governance is destabilized by chaotic tariff policy and capital flight, while conflicts of interest proliferate around crypto deregulation and Trump-branded investment products. Information space and civic memory are reshaped via censorship in military schools, repurposing Covid.gov, attacks on public and private media, and closure of the State Department’s disinformation office. Courts, some states, and civil society mount significant resistance, but the week’s net effect is to normalize executive defiance and partisan control over core democratic infrastructure.

6. Trump administration lawyers argued that returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia would intrude on presidential foreign affairs powers (2025-04-13): By claiming foreign-affairs immunity from court orders in the Abrego Garcia case, administration lawyers advanced a theory of executive power that would shield deportation decisions from judicial review.

15. Trump administration implemented policies and rhetoric that stratified citizenship by origin, ideology, and gender identity (2025-04-18): Across deportations, visa revocations, trans bans, and proof-of-citizenship voting rules, the administration increasingly tied rights and security to heritage and beliefs rather than equal citizenship.

16. Trump administration planned to vet social media of all visa applicants who had visited Gaza since 2007 (2025-04-17): Requiring social media screening for Gaza-linked visa applicants expanded surveillance of political associations and could deter lawful expression among those seeking entry.

2. US Department of Justice argued in court that it was not legally obligated to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia despite prior orders (2025-04-13): DOJ’s position that it lacked duty or power to retrieve a wrongfully deported resident, even after Supreme Court intervention, challenged judicial enforceability and raised alarms about executive claims to detain people abroad without remedy.

US District Judge Paula Xinis opened a fact-finding inquiry into the administration’s failure to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia (2025-04-15): By launching a two-week discovery process and allowing depositions over noncompliance with her order, the judge used contempt tools to test whether courts can compel an uncooperative executive to remedy unlawful deportations.

4.

4.

16. Trump administration began firing nearly 90% of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau staff after a court allowed downsizing (2025-04-17): Mass firings at the CFPB, even if short of abolition, would severely weaken federal consumer-finance oversight, shifting power toward financial institutions and away from individual borrowers.
