In the foreground, a large analog clock reads just before 8 p.m. Streets below are filled with overlapping scenes: immigration agents leading people into unmarked vans, uniformed soldiers standing at a protest line, and anonymous office windows glowing as data streams and code reflections flicker across the glass. The atmosphere is tense but outwardly orderly, painterly realism, muted colors, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 20 of Trump\u2019s second term registered almost no visible movement on the Democracy Clock, yet the underlying structure of power shifted further toward consolidation. Immigration enforcement became an overt instrument of political control: record ICE raids, collateral arrests, and the creation of an Office of Remigration turned status into a standing vulnerability, while National Guard and Marines were deployed against largely peaceful anti-deportation protests. A sympathetic Supreme Court expanded executive reach, upholding the firing of the NLRB chair, greenlighting a Musk-linked \u201cefficiency\u201d unit\u2019s access to Social Security data, and allowing the termination of humanitarian paroles for hundreds of thousands. Simultaneously, budget bills and executive orders hollowed out the safety net, privatized veterans\u2019 care, and weakened reproductive protections, even as tax cuts and crypto-friendly legislation favored elites. Public media, universities, and scientific agencies faced funding threats, censorship, and symbolic erasures. Courts, broadcasters, and civil society mounted pockets of resistance, but the week\u2019s through-line was normalization: law as weapon, surveillance as infrastructure, and inequality as design.",
