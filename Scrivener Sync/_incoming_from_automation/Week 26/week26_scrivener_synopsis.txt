Week 26 of Trump’s second term marked a consolidation of power rather than a single dramatic break. The Democracy Clock advanced from 11:04 p.m. to 11:09 p.m. as multiple systems bent in the same direction. The Supreme Court cleared mass layoffs at the Department of Education, and Trump’s Schedule G order converted swaths of the civil service into at‑will political posts, deepening the purge of expertise at DOJ, NIH, and State. Law was wielded as a weapon: lenient sentencing requests in civil‑rights cases, dropped charges for a vaccine‑destroying doctor, and secrecy around Epstein files, capped by the firing of prosecutor Maurene Comey. Immigration enforcement hardened into a domestic security campaign, backed by new data pipelines from the IRS and Medicaid to ICE and lethal workplace raids. Simultaneously, gerrymanders and voter‑roll purges narrowed representation, while public broadcasting and global media were defunded. Courts and civil society mounted scattered defenses, but the week’s through‑line was structural: embedding partisan control into jobs, data, budgets, and memory.
