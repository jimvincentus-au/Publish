In Week 36, the pattern that had been forming for months came into sharp relief. The presidency was no longer merely leaning on institutions; it was reaching inside them, rearranging their wiring so that law, security, and information bent toward one man\'92s grievances and fears. The week\'92s events did not bring a single spectacular rupture. Instead, they showed how a democracy can be hollowed from within while its outer shell still stands. Courts still sit, elections still occur, agencies still issue rules. Yet the purposes those institutions serve are altered. Power is used less as a trust and more as a weapon. The Democracy Clock held at 7:58 p.m. in public terms, but the internal movement told a different story. The hands did not lurch forward, yet the gears that drive them slipped further out of alignment.\
\
At the close of the prior period, the Clock stood at 7:58 p.m. It remains there now, though the underlying measure crept forward by a tenth of a minute. That small numerical change masks the depth of the week\'92s shifts. The time did not move because the system collapsed; it moved because the system adapted to a more openly retaliatory presidency. Law was used more aggressively against critics and more gently toward allies. The civil service was treated less as a neutral workforce and more as a pool of loyalists and expendables. Economic and statistical tools were turned toward obscuring hardship and rewarding friends. At the same time, some courts, state governments, and legislators pushed back, slowing but not stopping the drift. The net effect was not a dramatic fall but a tightening of the vise: more pressure on dissent, more impunity for insiders, and less room for truth to stand on its own.\
\
The clearest line of movement ran through the justice system. The week opened with the story of Tom Homan, Trump\'92s \'93border czar,\'94 whose recorded acceptance of $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents had once been the core of a bribery case. Under Trump\'92s second term, that case was not merely closed; it was denounced by political appointees as a \'93deep state\'94 plot, and the FBI and Justice Department leadership declared there was \'93no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing\'94 despite the tape. Democrats in Congress tried to pry the matter open again, writing to watchdogs and demanding tax records, but they did so without subpoena power and against a Justice Department whose Public Integrity Section had been gutted from thirty-six lawyers to two. In a healthy system, such a case would test whether law applies equally to powerful insiders. In this system, it became a test of loyalty, and the answer was clear. Allies would be shielded, and those who pressed too hard would find doors closed.\
\
At the same time, the machinery of prosecution was turned against long-standing critics of the president. Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had reviewed evidence against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey and concluded there was no case. For that, he was first pressured to resign and then, by Trump\'92s own account, fired. In his place, the president installed Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, first as interim and then as nominee for a full term. Within days, Halligan\'92s office secured a grand jury indictment of Comey on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a proceeding\'97charges that career prosecutors had previously declined to bring and that many legal observers considered thin. The indictment did not just target one man. It sent a message to the entire law enforcement and intelligence community that crossing the president in the past could carry criminal consequences in the present.\
\
The pattern extended beyond Comey. The FBI searched the home and office of John Bolton, another prominent critic, over alleged mishandling of classified documents, even as Bolton\'92s lawyer insisted the materials had been declassified. The administration opened a criminal investigation into former CIA Director John Brennan for his role in the 2016 assessment of Russian interference. A senior Justice Department official instructed U.S. attorneys to draw up plans to investigate a Soros-funded group after Trump demanded action against the billionaire. In each case, the targets shared a common trait: they had challenged Trump\'92s power or narrative. The law, which in theory should limit the executive, was instead being used as an extension of his will. The trait the Clock tracks as \'93law is a weapon, not a limit\'94 deepened its presence, not through a single decree but through a week\'92s worth of aligned choices.\
\
Courts, which might have served as a counterweight, offered a mixed picture. On one front, they checked executive overreach. A federal judge ordered the restoration of $500 million in frozen grants to UCLA, rejecting what appeared to be a politically motivated punishment over alleged civil-rights violations. Another judge blocked the administration from withholding billions in emergency management grants from states that refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, calling the conditions unconstitutional and arbitrary. These rulings affirmed that some judges still saw their role as enforcing neutral rules against the executive, even when the stakes were high. They mattered. They also stood out as exceptions.\
\
The Supreme Court\'92s emergency orders told a different story. In Trump v. Slaughter, the Court granted a stay that kept Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic Federal Trade Commission commissioner found to have been illegally fired, out of her job while the case proceeds. The decision, by a 6\'963 vote, signaled deference to the president\'92s claimed power to remove leaders of independent agencies, tilting the balance toward executive control over regulators meant to stand apart from politics. In another case, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the Court allowed Trump\'92s Executive Order 14169 to stand while litigation continues, clearing the way for the administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already appropriated. Together, these orders strengthened the presidency\'92s hand over both domestic regulation and international spending, even as lower courts tried to hold the line elsewhere. The trait that measures whether courts rule for donors and elites edged upward, not because judges declared it so, but because their emergency choices made it easier for the executive to bend independent bodies to his purposes.\
\
If law was being reshaped, so too was the civil service that carries it out. The week brought a blunt directive from the Office of Management and Budget: in the event of a government shutdown, agencies were to prepare not for temporary furloughs, as in past standoffs, but for large-scale firings of workers whose programs did not align with the president\'92s priorities. OMB Director Russell Vought made clear that this was not just about saving money; it was about using the shutdown threat to reorder the federal workforce along ideological lines. At the same time, the administration signaled that it expected a shutdown and saw it as a way to hit Democratic constituencies hardest. The message to career officials was stark. Their job security no longer depended on neutral performance but on political usefulness. That is a different kind of government.\
\
Elsewhere, agencies were being repurposed from their statutory missions toward ideological goals. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whistleblowers described how the Office of Fair Housing had been downsized, staff reassigned or laid off, and gag orders imposed. Cases involving discrimination against domestic violence victims were dropped or altered under political pressure, and settlements shrank. The effect was to hollow out federal enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, particularly in cases that touched on race and gender. At the State Department, staff reported that more than half of ambassadorships were vacant and that new \'93fidelity\'94 metrics measured loyalty in ways that could affect promotions and job security. In immigration, the administration began recruiting military lawyers from the Judge Advocate General\'92s corps to serve as temporary immigration judges, blurring the line between civilian adjudication and military discipline in a system already under strain from a mass deportation push. These moves did not abolish the civil service; they bent it, making it more responsive to partisan direction and less anchored in professional norms.\
\
Immigration enforcement became a central theater where these shifts played out. Congress passed a bill allocating $170 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement over four years, with the explicit goal of deporting one million immigrants annually. This vast funding increase, coupled with the recruitment of JAG officers as immigration judges, signaled a structural commitment to high-volume removals. Newly released data showed that, for the first time in Trump\'92s second term, ICE was detaining more immigrants with no criminal record than those with one, contradicting the administration\'92s claim that it was focused on \'93bad hombres.\'94 The human cost of this approach surfaced in individual stories. Rodney Taylor, a double amputee from Liberia, was held for eight months in Georgia\'92s Stewart detention center despite serious medical needs. Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Mexican man, died after being transferred from an ICE facility to a hospital in California. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines public schools, was detained on a final removal order despite his role as a widely respected local leader. These were not abstractions. They were lives caught in a system that now treated status and identity as grounds for punishment.\
\
Inside the detention system, nineteen detainees at an ICE facility within Louisiana\'92s Angola prison launched a hunger strike, demanding basic medical care, necessities, and access to legal and religious services. Their protest drew attention to conditions described as unsafe and degrading. In Dallas, a gunman opened fire on an ICE field office from a nearby rooftop, killing one detainee and injuring two others before taking his own life. Shell casings and notes with anti-ICE messages were found, and the FBI treated the attack as targeted violence. The administration seized on such incidents to frame opposition to its immigration policies as a security threat. That framing would soon be codified in orders that reached far beyond the immigration system itself. The trait that tracks citizenship being stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage moved higher, as enforcement patterns and funding choices deepened a tiered system of rights.\
\
The week\'92s most consequential documents were two pieces of paper signed at the White House. The first was an executive order designating \'93antifa\'94 as a domestic terrorist organization. Though antifa is more a loose tendency than a structured group, the order described it as a militarist, anarchist enterprise seeking to overthrow the government and directed agencies to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle its \'93operations,\'94 including those who fund them. Legal experts noted that U.S. law provides no clear framework for labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations, precisely because of First Amendment concerns. Nonetheless, the order opened the door to using counterterrorism tools\'97surveillance, asset freezes, enhanced penalties\'97against people associated, however loosely, with left-leaning protest. It marked a shift from seeing protest as a political act to seeing it as a security problem.\
\
The second document was a presidential memorandum on domestic terrorism and political violence. Issued on September 25, it instructed the FBI\'92s joint terrorism taskforces, the Justice Department, and the Treasury to focus on what Trump called a radical leftwing \'93terror network\'94 fueling violence against ICE agents. It also directed the IRS to scrutinize tax-exempt entities that might be financing such activities. Civil liberties groups warned that the memo could be used to target nonprofits, activists, and community organizations that opposed administration policies, labeling them as security threats rather than political actors. Taken together, the order and the memo did more than respond to specific incidents. They reframed dissent itself\'97especially on the left\'97as a form of domestic terrorism, and they gave legal cover to treat protest, organizing, and even charitable work as potential crimes. The trait that tracks dissent being recast as disorder, treason, or terrorism rose sharply.\
\
This reframing did not occur in a vacuum. It was reinforced by rhetoric from elected officials and by the selective use of violence as a political talking point. In Arizona, state representative John Gillette posted that Representative Pramila Jayapal should be \'93tried, convicted and hanged\'94 for a video in which she discussed non-violent protests against the administration. Gillette had previously defended January 6 rioters and made derogatory remarks about Muslims. His call for execution did not carry legal force, but it showed how far the language of treason and punishment had seeped into mainstream politics. At the same time, shootings at ICE facilities and threats against law enforcement were highlighted as evidence of a leftwing terror wave, even as the administration\'92s own words and policies stoked anger and fear. The trait that tracks dissenters being labeled unpatriotic, subversive, or corrupt also moved upward, as calls for extreme punishment of critics became more normalized.\
\
Information and media, which might have countered these narratives, came under heavy pressure. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\'92s department issued a memo requiring journalists to sign a pledge not to gather or report \'93unauthorized\'94 information, even if unclassified, on pain of losing their press credentials. Reporters\'92 movements inside the building were restricted to specific areas, and escorts became mandatory. The stated justification was national security, but the effect was to make independent reporting on military affairs more difficult and to force journalists into a relationship of permission rather than scrutiny. The Pentagon\'92s move was echoed by the Federal Communications Commission, where Trump loyalist Brendan Carr threatened to revoke ABC affiliates\'92 broadcast licenses after late-night host Jimmy Kimmel criticized the administration\'92s response to the killing of Charlie Kirk. ABC suspended Kimmel\'92s show under that pressure, prompting public backlash, boycotts, and protests. After \'93days of thoughtful conversations,\'94 the network reinstated him, but major station groups Sinclair and Nexstar refused to air the program on their ABC affiliates. Independent media were squeezed while aligned outlets held the gate.\
\
The president himself escalated the conflict. He declared that negative coverage of his administration was \'93really illegal\'94 and called for the prosecution of critics, including comedians and hecklers. He later suggested that Kimmel\'92s show amounted to an illegal campaign contribution to Democrats and hinted at further action against ABC, citing a previous financial settlement. These statements did not change the First Amendment on paper, but they altered the climate in which media organizations operate. When the head of state labels criticism as criminal and regulators threaten licenses, editors and executives must weigh not only audience and ethics but also the risk of retaliation. The traits that measure whether investigative journalists are smeared or surveilled, and whether independent media are starved while state-aligned outlets thrive, moved upward in tandem.\
\
Truth itself was strained in other domains. In public remarks and at the United Nations, Trump claimed that acetaminophen use in pregnancy caused a \'93very increased risk of autism,\'94 despite decades of evidence to the contrary. He discouraged vaccines and promoted \'93natural\'94 motherhood, undermining trust in medical guidance. Former President Barack Obama called these statements \'93violence against the truth,\'94 and health officials in the United Kingdom urged women to ignore them. At the UN General Assembly, Trump delivered a 55-minute speech attacking green energy, calling climate change a \'93con job,\'94 and falsely claiming that London was moving toward sharia law. He urged nations to close their borders and expel foreigners, accused the UN of promoting a \'93globalist migration agenda,\'94 and boasted of ending wars and securing investments that independent fact-checkers said did not exist. His Treasury Secretary suggested that threats to European cities did not equate to threats to American cities, casting doubt on U.S. commitment to NATO. In parallel, the Energy Department announced it would return $13 billion in green project funds to the Treasury, dismissing prior climate initiatives as a \'93Green New Scam.\'94 The combination of falsehood and policy rollback did not just change the country\'92s stance on climate and migration; it rewrote the story the government tells about its responsibilities to the planet and to allies.\
\
The manipulation of information extended to economic data and archives. The Bureau of Labor Statistics postponed its annual consumer expenditures report, a key tool for understanding inflation, shortly after Trump fired the BLS commissioner over disappointing job numbers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture terminated its long-running annual report on household food security, even though the last report had shown 18 million households facing food insecurity. USDA officials called the reports \'93redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous.\'94 At the same time, the department canceled a national food insecurity survey and froze more than $10 million in food assistance to Kansas after the state refused to hand over personal data on beneficiaries. These moves made it harder for state and local officials to assess hunger and for the public to gauge the real cost of inflation and labor market shifts. They also showed how data could be used as leverage: withheld from the public, demanded from states, and deployed to punish those who did not comply. The trait that tracks economic data being selectively published, massaged, or ignored rose sharply.\
\
The National Archives, an institution meant to stand above politics, stumbled into the fray. A branch of the Archives released nearly unredacted military records of Representative Mikie Sherrill to an ally of her Republican opponent in the New Jersey governor\'92s race, including sensitive personal information. The release appeared to violate the Privacy Act and raised questions about whether archival processes were being politicized. At the same time, the Archives invited public comment on proposed records schedules, a routine but important step in deciding which federal records are preserved and which are destroyed. The juxtaposition was striking. On one hand, a formal process for public input on the fate of records; on the other, an improper disclosure that suggested those records could be weaponized in electoral contests. The trait that tracks whether government archives are sealed, sanitized, or misused edged higher, not because boxes were burned, but because the trust that underpins archival neutrality was shaken.\
\
Economic power, too, was used in ways that blurred public purpose and private gain. The State Department announced plans to redirect $1.8 billion in foreign aid toward \'93America First\'94 projects, moving away from long-standing bipartisan goals of promoting democracy and health. The Treasury and other agencies prepared a $20 billion support package for Argentina\'92s right-wing president, Javier Milei, a Trump ally, outside the usual appropriations process. The Treasury also sanctioned the wife of a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who had overseen Jair Bolsonaro\'92s prosecution, prompting Brazil to accuse the U.S. of undue interference. Domestically, Trump imposed steep tariffs on Brazilian goods, pharmaceuticals, furniture, cabinets, and heavy trucks, often citing grievances tied to foreign prosecutions or trade practices. He promised to use tariff revenues to bail out American farmers hurt by his own trade policies. Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expedited $11 million in disaster aid to rebuild a historic pier in Naples, Florida, after intervention by a political donor. Each decision could be defended on narrow grounds. Together, they showed a pattern: foreign aid, sanctions, tariffs, and disaster relief were being steered toward allies and donors, and away from neutral criteria, making crony capitalism harder to distinguish from governance.\
\
Amid these shifts, there were pockets of resistance and adaptation. In the realm of public health, seven Northeastern states and New York City formed a regional collaborative to coordinate vaccine guidance and emergency preparedness as federal recommendations grew more erratic. On the West Coast, governors of Oregon, Washington, California, and Hawaii issued their own winter vaccine recommendations, urging residents to stay current on Covid, flu, and RSV shots. AHIP, a major health insurance trade group, announced that its members would continue to cover all immunizations recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as of early September, even as national guidance wavered. These regional and private actions did not repair federal damage, but they showed how subnational actors could step into the vacuum, building parallel structures of trust and information. They kept some channels of truth open.\
\
In elections and representation, the week brought both strain and modest reinforcement. In Georgia, the state Republican Party barred Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger from qualifying as a Republican candidate and expelled former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, punishing them for rejecting Trump\'92s false claims about the 2020 election. Raffensperger nonetheless announced a run for governor, pledging fidelity to law and the constitution, while Duncan switched parties and entered the race as a Democrat, arguing for cross-party coalitions against extremism. Their candidacies underscored how loyalty tests within a party can narrow internal democracy, even as voters retain formal choices on the ballot. In Arizona, Adelita Grijalva won a special election to fill her late father\'92s House seat, becoming the state\'92s first Latina member of Congress. Her victory narrowed the Republican majority and provided the final signature needed on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on releasing government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. That petition, backed by members from both parties, challenged leadership efforts to bury records that might implicate powerful figures, including Trump and prominent donors. It was a small but concrete step toward transparency in a domain where impunity has long been the norm.\
\
What lies ahead is already partly visible. The executive order labeling antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and the domestic terrorism memorandum are not one-week stories; they will shape how law enforcement, the IRS, and the Treasury treat protests and nonprofits in the months to come. The Supreme Court\'92s stays in the Slaughter and foreign aid cases will influence how far the president can go in removing independent regulators and redirecting congressionally appropriated funds. The OMB memo on mass firings in a shutdown, and the administration\'92s stated expectation that a shutdown will occur and hit Democratic constituencies hardest, set the stage for a confrontation in which the livelihoods of civil servants become bargaining chips. The lawsuits against six states for voter data, and earlier suits against Maine and Oregon, will test how much control states retain over their rolls and how far the federal government can go in centralizing voter information. And the improper release of Mikie Sherrill\'92s records, if not treated as an aberration, could signal a broader pattern of using archives as tools in electoral combat.\
\
By the end of Week 36, the Democracy Clock still read 7:58 p.m., but the meaning of that hour had shifted. The week did not bring tanks to the streets or the cancellation of elections. It brought something subtler and, in some ways, more insidious: the normalization of practices that treat law as a cudgel, civil servants as pawns, data as propaganda, and dissent as terrorism. The moral floor, already cracked, showed deeper fractures across character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship. Yet the story is not one of unbroken descent. Courts blocked some overreaches. States formed health alliances. Legislators pressed for Epstein files and Homan tapes. Voters in Arizona sent a representative to Congress who pledged to uphold democracy and protect immigrants\'92 rights. These acts did not reverse the week\'92s damage, but they kept alive the idea that institutions can still serve the public rather than the powerful.\
\
The official end-of-period time remains 7:58 p.m. That constancy should not comfort. It reflects a system in which formal structures endure while their inner workings are repurposed. The week matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly that repurposing can accelerate once key thresholds are crossed: when prosecutors are fired for refusing political cases, when terrorism labels are applied to domestic opponents, when economic data and archives are trimmed to fit a narrative. In such a landscape, the distance between a functioning democracy and a managed one is measured less in minutes than in habits\'97of leaders, of institutions, and of citizens. Week 36 recorded a further erosion of those habits. Whether future weeks can rebuild them, or whether the hands will move closer to midnight, will depend on how these patterns are met, resisted, or accepted in the time that remains.\
