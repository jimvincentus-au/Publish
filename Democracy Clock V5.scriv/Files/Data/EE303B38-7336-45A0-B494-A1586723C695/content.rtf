\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 30 Appendix: Emergency as Method\
\
This was a structurally heavy week of authoritarian drift, centered on the federalization of Washington, D.C. policing and a broader pattern of weaponizing federal power against disfavored jurisdictions and vulnerable groups. Trump\'92s declaration of a crime \'93emergency,\'94 National Guard deployment, and attempted takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department\'97despite falling crime\'97directly hit traits around normalized emergency powers, executive overreach, and security forces aligned with regime preservation. Parallel moves in immigration enforcement, including aggressive ICE raids, threats against sanctuary cities, and expansion of detention infrastructure, deepened stratified citizenship and the use of law as a weapon. Economic governance showed accelerating state capitalism and cronyism: bespoke revenue deals with chipmakers, politicized control of statistical agencies, and court\uc0\u8209 enabled gutting of the CFPB. Information and memory politics advanced through politicized appointments, data manipulation, and efforts to ideologically vet the Smithsonian and reinstall Confederate symbolism. Countervailing forces\'97federal court rulings restoring transparency, protecting DEI and democracy funding, and successful pushback that partially rolled back the D.C. police takeover\'97demonstrate that judicial and state-level resistance remains active, but under mounting pressure.\
