This move is part of a larger downsizing effort affecting other intelligence agencies, including the NSA. The cuts will be implemented over several years, primarily through reduced hiring rather than layoffs. The CIA has stated that these changes align with national security priorities and aim to rejuvenate the agency. The administration has also eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies, although a judge has temporarily blocked the firing of 19 employees involved in these programs.",

This investigation mirrors a lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS, claiming the network's editing decisions constituted \"election interference.\" The FCC's actions mark a departure from its longstanding policy, which typically does not consider minor editing as distortion. Carr suggested that CBS's actions could lead to the revocation of its broadcast license. This investigation is unprecedented and raises concerns about government overreach into media operations.",
