Behind them, a window reveals a blurred line of soldiers and police lights. Warm, dramatic lighting, painterly realism, no faces or text.",
    "wide": "A dusk cityscape of Washington DC and Memphis blended together, streets lined with National Guard troops in muted uniforms alongside local police cruisers, floodlit checkpoints and barricades cutting across familiar neighborhoods, the Capitol dome and a distant White House glowing under a darkening sky. In the foreground, a large, old-fashioned clock reads just past 8:08, its glass slightly cracked. Billboards and building facades show faded traces where protest posters and historical plaques have been removed, leaving pale rectangles. The atmosphere is tense but quiet, painterly realism with rich shadows and cool blues, no recognizable politicians, no text."

The Democracy Clock inched from 8:07 to 8:08 p.m., a small numerical shift masking a dense pattern of erosion. National Guard deployments in Memphis and a federal takeover of Washington DC\u2019s police normalized militarized, centralized control over local policing. ICE raids, abusive detention, and speech-based visa revocations deepened a tiered system of citizenship, even as courts sporadically protected vulnerable immigrants. Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing became a pretext for elite security funding, loyalty tests, and media purges, while FCC pressure and corporate compliance sidelined critical voices and elevated regime-aligned programming. Inside government, vaccine advisory bodies were purged, climate science undermined, labor protections gutted, and watchdogs intimidated or reassigned. Courts, states, and civil society mounted real but fragmented resistance. The week\u2019s net effect was to make opposition costlier and executive power more insulated, with law and information increasingly bent toward preserving the regime.",
