  "long_synopsis": "Week 8 of Trump\u2019s second term registered only a 0.2\u2011minute shift on the Democracy Clock, leaving the public time at 7:52 p.m., but the machinery behind the face changed markedly. Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency consolidated veto power over agencies, driving mass layoffs, lease closures, and program dismantling while inflating unverifiable \u201csavings\u201d and stripping transparency. Executive orders hollowed non\u2011statutory components of agencies, defunded the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and terminated diversity programs, politicizing civil service roles and weakening civil\u2011rights enforcement. Immigration and emergency powers were repurposed to end birthright citizenship, revive family detention, and target pro\u2011Palestinian activists, turning nationality and perceived allegiance into conditions for rights. Law enforcement and clemency increasingly shielded allies and punished critics, even as courts forced DOGE disclosures and blocked some cuts. Universities, environmental protections, and public\u2011health information came under coordinated pressure, while civil society mobilized protests and voting\u2011rights efforts that remained visible but structurally outpaced.",
