Week 14 of Trump’s second term unfolded as a dense, structural tightening rather than a single dramatic break. The Democracy Clock barely moved, from 476.7 to 476.9 minutes, holding at 7:57 p.m., yet executive power pressed harder against legal and institutional limits. The White House signaled defiance of a unanimous Supreme Court order in the Kilmar Ábrego García deportation case, even as courts paused Venezuelan removals, blocked sanctuary-city funding threats, and restored Voice of America. Immigration enforcement grew harsher and less accountable, with wrongful citizen detentions, closure of detention oversight offices, and identity-based targeting of students and activists. Universities became central leverage points: billions in grants were frozen, tax status threatened, accreditation rules rewritten, and immigration tools deployed to chill protest. Simultaneously, civil-rights enforcement was narrowed through elimination of disparate-impact liability and deep Medicaid and disability cuts, while agencies like Interior, State, and DOGE were centralized, captured, or outsourced. Courts, state laws, and mass protests offered pockets of resistance, but the week’s net effect was to normalize a presidency that treats law as optional and institutions as instruments.
