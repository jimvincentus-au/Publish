<h1>Week 16 Appendix: Stratified Rights as Routine Governance</h1>
<p><em>With the clock frozen at 7:59 p.m., immigration, media, and the civil service are quietly retooled to sort who is protected, heard, and expendable.</em></p>
<p>This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive consolidating power across media, civil service, immigration, and regulatory domains while courts and some state actors mounted partial resistance. The most acute pressures fell on information and media pluralism (VoA shutdown and OAN outsourcing, NPR/PBS defunding, FCC’s CBS investigation, Bondi’s rollback of leak protections), civil service depoliticization (DOGE firings, EPA and NIH purges, hiring freeze, dismantling of safety and consumer agencies), and immigration enforcement (massive ICE build‑up, deputization of other agencies, detention policies, self‑deportation scheme). Crony capitalism and emoluments deepened through Trump family crypto and Gulf business deals, large institutional investments in Trump Media, and regulatory leverage over mergers and DEI. At the same time, federal courts in North Carolina and in the Öztürk case, state policies in New York and Hawaii, and mobilized lawyers in defense of rule of law provided meaningful counter‑pressures. Overall, the week shows an administration using chaos, symbolic nationalism, and selective law enforcement to entrench a patronage‑driven, media‑managed presidency, while institutional guardrails strain but have not yet broken.</p>
