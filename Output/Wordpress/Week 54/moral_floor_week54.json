    "narrative": "This week continued a troubling trend of ethical erosion observed in previous weeks, where federal power is increasingly wielded against dissenting voices and communities. The administration's actions reflect a systematic undermining of democratic norms, particularly in jurisdictions that oppose its policies. While there are signs of resistance from courts and civil society, the overall trajectory indicates a deepening of these issues, with the moral floor showing significant cracks.",
