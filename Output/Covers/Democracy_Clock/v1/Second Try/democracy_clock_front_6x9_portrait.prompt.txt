Democracy Clock — book cover background artwork (front cover only).
    ORIENTATION: portrait, designed for a 6x9 book cover.

    PALETTE + TONE (CANONICAL)
- archival artifact aesthetic; institutional, documentary, historically grounded
- richer, disciplined tones (not pale tan): deep slate blue, smoky steel, warm parchment, restrained amber highlights
- low saturation overall but with deeper midtones; moderate contrast; avoid both crushed blacks and washed-out beige
- soft diffuse light with gentle directional falloff; no theatrical spotlighting; no neon
- subtle archival grain / paper texture / film noise (NOT painterly brushwork; NOT flat vector illustration)
- mood: serious, authoritative, evidentiary; calm gravity rather than melodrama

    SUBJECT + MOTIF
    - dominant analog clock motif with Roman numerals; hands near midnight (sense of proximity, not spectacle)
    - archival-record overlays: faint docket lines, filings, timestamp textures, aged paper (NON-readable, abstract)
    - civic process is implied, not illustrated: soft silhouettes or a quiet queue as atmospheric presence (no literal booths)
    - optional, extremely faint institutional backdrop: courthouse columns / Capitol-like architecture, out of focus and secondary
    - overall emphasis: documentary record, institutional accountability, time pressure

    COMPOSITION
    - Preserve a clean title field: generous negative space in the upper 30% (smooth gradient, low texture).
    - Prefer asymmetry and editorial restraint: clock may be partially cropped or off-center to avoid “poster symbolism.”
    - Keep primary visual mass in the mid-to-lower half; avoid competing focal points.
    - Depth via atmospheric haze and layered archival textures; keep textures subtle in the title area.
    - Edges calm and low-frequency; avoid noisy borders.
    - Thumbnail test: the clock motif must still read clearly at small sizes.
