This move aims to bypass the need for congressional approval to formally close the department. Trump cited the department's increased budget and stagnant national test scores as reasons for the decision. The executive order has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue it could jeopardize federal funding for millions of low-income families and negatively impact public education.",
