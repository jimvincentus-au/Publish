      "summary": "Verizon has officially ended its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, as revealed in a letter from Verizon Executive Vice President & Chief Legal Officer Vandana Venkatesh to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The letter, dated May 15, 2025, states that Verizon will no longer maintain DEI teams, roles, or goals, and will remove DEI references from training materials and its website. The company claims these changes are due to Supreme Court rulings and federal mandates, although no such legal requirements exist. The move coincides with the FCC's approval of Verizon's $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications, which was contingent on ending DEI policies.",

Upon arrival, at least four individuals, including Subedi, were rejected by Bhutanese authorities and subsequently expelled to India, eventually ending up in a refugee camp in Nepal. This action has left them in a state of statelessness, as they had previously fled ethnic cleansing in Bhutan and were resettled in the US. The deportations have raised concerns about the safety and legal rights of these individuals.",
