# Week 34 Appendix: War Logic at Home

This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and security power, with courts and Congress increasingly enabling rather than constraining it. The Trump administration normalized military and paramilitary deployments into Democratic-led cities (DC, Chicago, Memphis) and immigration crackdowns (Hyundai raids, Operation Midway Blitz), while the Supreme Court repeatedly greenlit racial profiling and expanded presidential control over independent agencies and spending. Legislative moves—mandatory-minimum immigration sentencing, stripping DC’s budget, Senate rules easing confirmations—further hollowed deliberative checks. Simultaneously, federal agencies and courts advanced a hard-right social and economic agenda: cutting science and health funding, defunding Planned Parenthood and NSF grants, restricting immigrant access to services, and undercutting environmental and climate programs. Information control and memory politics intensified around Epstein, Charlie Kirk’s assassination, and immigration, with disinformation, secrecy, and symbolic glorification used to frame dissent as treasonous and to sanctify regime-aligned figures. There were pockets of resistance—state-level social programs, some protective court rulings, and large protests—but structurally the week entrenched authoritarian-style governance across security, immigration, economic regulation, and civic space.

Week 34 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Donald Trump signed an order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War (2025-09-06): Renaming the Pentagon as the Department of War signaled a more aggressive military posture and used symbolic executive power to reframe the role of the armed forces in national life.

2. President Donald Trump approved a covert 2019 Navy SEAL mission in North Korea without briefing congressional leaders (2025-09-06): Authorizing a lethal covert operation without notifying the Gang of Eight bypassed statutory oversight of intelligence activities and concentrated war-making authority in the presidency.

3. President Donald Trump hosted the inaugural "Rose Garden Club" dinner at the White House for loyal supporters (2025-09-06): Turning a public space into a loyalty-focused club event blurred lines between state property and personal patronage, reinforcing a politics of personal allegiance over institutional duty.

4. President Donald Trump threatened military action against Chicago in social media posts (2025-09-06): Publicly suggesting military action against a U.S. city used the symbolism of armed force to intimidate a political jurisdiction, normalizing threats of domestic military deployment.

5. President Donald Trump deployed approximately 2,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC and took control of the city’s police department (2025-09-06): Federalizing local policing and stationing troops in the capital shifted everyday public order from civilian to military-style control, weakening local self-governance.

11.

14.

Institutions and Governance

4. House Speaker Mike Johnson first suggested and then retracted a claim that Donald Trump had been an FBI informant in the Epstein case (2025-09-07): Issuing and walking back an unfounded claim about Trump’s role in the Epstein investigation showed senior leadership using sensitive law-enforcement narratives for political positioning.

12. U.S. Supreme Court paused a lower-court ruling that limited ICE stops based on race or language in Los Angeles (2025-09-08): Using the emergency docket to restore broad ICE stop powers signaled judicial tolerance for racial profiling in immigration enforcement and curtailed lower-court protections.

13. U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Donald Trump exceeded his authority in imposing sweeping global tariffs (2025-09-07): Finding that broad tariffs overstepped statutory limits challenged unilateral presidential control over trade policy and set up a major separation-of-powers test.

14. U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump’s appeal on the legality of his global tariffs and kept them in place (2025-09-08): Taking up the tariff case while allowing contested duties to continue preserved the status quo of expansive executive trade power pending final review.

15. U.S. Supreme Court temporarily allowed President Trump to withhold nearly $5 billion in foreign aid appropriated by Congress (2025-09-09): Letting a pocket rescission stand during appeal weakened Congress’s power of the purse and enabled executive non-spending of duly appropriated democracy and peacekeeping funds.
