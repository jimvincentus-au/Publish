# Week 17 Appendix: Citizenship as Leverage

*A week of near-static clock time in which law, borders, and money were quietly retooled to sort belonging and shield power from consequence.*

![Header image](image_wide_week17_appendix.png)

This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian pressure across multiple pillars of U.S. democracy. The most acute threats cluster around rule of law, immigration, and foreign influence. The administration openly toys with suspending habeas corpus and due process for migrants, weaponizes the Alien Enemies Act, and directs DOJ to "name and shame" political opponents while preparing investigations of prosecutors who charged Trump. Immigration enforcement is fused with political repression: ICE misleads courts to raid student activists, DHS floats classifying migrants as an "invasion," and National Guard deployment for immigration is explored. Simultaneously, a dense web of foreign money and arms deals—Qatar’s $400m jet, a $5.5bn Trump-branded golf project, massive Saudi and Qatari arms packages, and sanctions relief for Syria tied to Trump-branded real estate—pushes emoluments and crony capitalism to the foreground. Civil society and media are squeezed through mass firings at Voice of America, exclusion of reporters from Air Force One, campus crackdowns, and new tools to strip nonprofits’ tax status. Courts and some states push back on deportations, health cuts, and grant retaliation, but the net structural pressure is strongly negative.

President Donald Trump planned to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One and later his library (2025-05-11): Trump’s plan to accept a $400m jet from Qatar for presidential and later personal use blurred the line between public office and private enrichment, raising serious emoluments and foreign influence concerns.

3. President Donald Trump rarely attended in-person daily intelligence briefings during his second term (2025-05-10): Trump’s minimal participation in intelligence briefings reduced informed oversight of security agencies and weakened accountable decision-making on national security threats.

9. President Donald Trump promised Saudi Arabia $142 billion in advanced U.S. defense and security equipment (2025-05-13): Trump’s commitment to a massive Saudi arms package deepened security dependence on an authoritarian partner and tied U.S. defense policy to lucrative weapons exports.

11. Department of Justice weaponization working group head Ed Martin announced a policy to publicly name and shame political opponents who cannot be charged (2025-05-15): DOJ’s new practice of publicly stigmatizing uncharged political targets repurposed prosecutorial authority into a tool of reputational punishment outside normal legal process.

12. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired the National Intelligence Council chair and deputy after a report contradicted Trump’s claims on Venezuela (2025-05-15): Removing top intelligence analysts for producing findings at odds with presidential narratives signaled political control over intelligence and discouraged independent threat assessment.

12. House Republicans proposed a tax bill altering the child tax credit and excluding many low-income and undocumented families (2025-05-14): By conditioning full child tax credits on higher earnings and Social Security numbers, the bill would deny benefits to millions of poor and mixed-status families, embedding status-based inequality into the tax code.
