    "wide": "A dusk-lit panorama of Washington, D.C., with the Department of Justice, the Capitol, and federal office blocks looming under a heavy sky. In the foreground, a large clock face reads 8:08, its glass cracked but still ticking. One side of the scene shows shuttered food assistance offices and a darkened data center with blank screens; the other side shows rows of detention buses and riot police silhouettes facing a small group of protesters. The style is painterly and realistic, with muted colors and strong contrasts, no recognizable politicians, no text."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 36 of Trump\u2019s second term brought no single rupture, but a dense layering of moves that left the state feeling less like a shared instrument and more like a partisan weapon. The Democracy Clock held at 8:08 p.m., masking a volatile balance between deepening authoritarian practices and scattered resistance. At the Justice Department, the Public Integrity Section was quietly hollowed out while the Tom Homan bribery case was closed despite recorded evidence, even as prosecutors were pushed to indict James Comey and investigate John Brennan. A domestic terrorism order targeting Antifa and a memo casting left-leaning groups as a \u201cterror network\u201d re-aimed security powers at dissent, while Congress poured $170 billion into ICE as it detained more non\u2011criminal immigrants and faced hunger strikes over brutal conditions. Federal agencies froze Kansas food aid, punished trans\u2011inclusive schools, and sued states for voter data, even as USDA and BLS erased key hunger and inflation metrics. Pentagon press pledges, FCC license threats over Jimmy Kimmel, and politicized archival leaks tightened control over information and memory. Courts, states, and civil society won scattered victories, but the week\u2019s throughline was the normalization of law, hunger, and data as tools of leverage.",
