In Week 33 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock barely moved, inching from 487.2 to 487.3 minutes, holding at 8:07 p.m. on its public face. Beneath that apparent stillness, power became more personal, insulated, and punitive. The president openly declared a need for “authoritarian-style powers,” rebranded the Pentagon as a Department of War, and used executive orders to reshape trade, foreign aid, and even election rules, sidestepping Congress. National security tools were personalized: a CIA officer was outed and stripped of clearance, troops were deployed off Venezuela, and domestic Guard patrols turned parts of Washington into occupied space. Immigration hardened into a sprawling security regime, with mass ICE hiring, spyware contracts, bond denials, and targeted crackdowns on Palestinians, asylum seekers, and sanctuary cities. Inside the state, whistleblowers were punished, public health and environmental agencies were purged and defunded, and public media was hollowed out. Courts and some states pushed back on tariffs, deportations, and funding cuts, but their resistance only slowed, rather than reversed, the consolidation of rule by decree.
