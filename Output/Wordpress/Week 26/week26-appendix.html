<h1>Week 26 Appendix: Data and Force as Governance</h1>
<p><em>In a week without a single shock, immigration raids, civil service purges, and curated secrecy deepened a regime of control over bodies, data, and memory.</em></p>
<p>This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with converging pressures on rule of law, civil service independence, immigration enforcement, and information integrity. The administration deepened its project of politicizing the state: Schedule G and mass layoffs at Education and State, purges and retaliatory firings at DOJ, and ideological reshaping at NIH and VA all push the bureaucracy toward loyalty over competence (traits 1, 7, 22). Immigration policy hardened into a quasi-police-state architecture—ending bond hearings, rapid deportations, courthouse arrests, data-sharing from Medicaid and IRS, and lethal, highly visible raids—entrenching a two-tier citizenship regime (traits 4, 9, 45, 47). Simultaneously, Congress and the executive coordinated to defund public broadcasting and foreign aid while expanding border surveillance and tariffs, reinforcing crony capitalism and weakening independent media and alliances (traits 16, 26, 38, 43). The Epstein files saga crystallized information manipulation and elite impunity: DOJ opacity, retaliatory personnel moves, and partisan blocking of transparency collided with cross-partisan demands and court-ordered unsealing (traits 17, 21, 51, 60). A few countervailing moves—courts protecting some immigrants and refugees, bipartisan pushes for Epstein transparency, and robust protest mobilization—offered limited but notable democratic resistance.</p>
