In Week 23, the pattern that had been building since the start of the term came into sharp relief. Power moved on several fronts at once: outward, in the form of bombs dropped on Iran without the consent of Congress; inward, through masked raids and new detention camps that turned immigration enforcement into a tool of fear; and upward, as courts narrowed their own ability to restrain the executive even while controversial nominees with records of defying judges advanced. The week\'92s events did not introduce a new logic so much as they revealed the logic already at work: emergency as a way of governing, law as an instrument rather than a limit, and information as something to be managed rather than shared. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 8:00 p.m., moved to 8:01 p.m. This small shift in time masked a large shift in structure. It marked a further step away from a system in which power is checked, argued over, and justified, and toward one in which it is asserted, defended, and then wrapped in a story that cannot be questioned without risk.\
\
The previous week had closed at 8:00 p.m., already well into the evening of democratic risk. By the end of this week, the clock read 8:01 p.m., a net movement of 1.2 minutes. The change was driven less by a single spectacular act than by the way several acts locked together. The unauthorized strikes on Iran, carried out without a declaration of war or prior authorization, were the clearest breach of constitutional practice. But the strikes were followed by canceled briefings, restricted access to intelligence, and a campaign to discredit the very assessments that contradicted the president\'92s claims of \'93total success.\'94 At the same time, the Supreme Court narrowed the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, even as the Justice Department explored ways to ignore the injunctions that remained. Immigration enforcement, already harsh, became more openly a system of quotas, masks, and camps. And institutions that once mediated knowledge\'97public broadcasters, vaccine panels, universities\'97were purged or bent toward loyalist ends. The clock moved because these developments did not merely break norms; they made it harder for the next Congress, the next court, or the next generation to repair what had been damaged.\
\
The most visible development of Week 23 was the decision to bomb Iran\'92s nuclear facilities. On June 21, the president ordered large-scale airstrikes on three sites\'97Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan\'97using B\uc0\u8209 2 bombers and bunker\u8209 busting munitions. There was no congressional resolution, no formal declaration of war, and no serious attempt to secure authorization under the War Powers Resolution. The strikes were announced on social media and then in a televised address as a \'93spectacular military success\'94 that had \'93completely and totally obliterated\'94 Iran\'92s nuclear program. Intelligence assessments told a different story. The U.S. intelligence community had concluded in March that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and had not authorized such a program. After the strikes, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that the damage would likely set Iran back only a few months and that much of its enriched uranium stockpile had been moved before the bombs fell. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran retained hundreds of kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent. Yet the White House dismissed these findings as wrong and sidelined its own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, from Senate briefings in favor of more politically aligned officials. In this sequence, the president did not just act without oversight; he acted against the advice of his own intelligence services and then moved to control what Congress and the public could know about the consequences. That is a different order of risk.\
\
Congress did not accept this quietly, but its tools proved weak. Members from both chambers, including Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Sean Casten, declared the strikes unconstitutional and invoked the War Powers Resolution. A group of twelve House Democratic veterans backed a resolution to limit the president\'92s authority to wage war in Iran, citing the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan. Another Republican, Representative Thomas Massie, introduced his own War Powers measure and was promptly attacked by the president on social media as disloyal. Yet when articles of impeachment were brought to the House floor over the unauthorized strikes, only seventy\uc0\u8209 nine Democrats supported them, and the effort was tabled. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, showed little appetite to challenge the president\'92s war powers. Classified briefings that might have informed debate were canceled or postponed without explanation. When a Defense Intelligence assessment leaking to the press contradicted the president\'92s claims, the administration responded not by correcting the record but by announcing plans to restrict congressional access to classified information. In this way, the formal power of Congress to declare war and oversee national security was hollowed out in practice, even as the institution continued to meet, speak, and vote. The forms remained. The substance thinned.\
\
The courts, which in earlier years had often acted as a counterweight to executive overreach, also shifted in Week 23. The Supreme Court issued a series of decisions that narrowed the ability of lower courts to restrain federal policy. In a 6\'963 ruling, the justices held that nationwide injunctions\'97orders that block a federal policy across the entire country\'97likely exceeded the authority granted by Congress. The case arose from challenges to an executive order on birthright citizenship, but the reasoning applied more broadly. Going forward, injunctions would generally protect only the named plaintiffs, unless a class action was certified. In parallel emergency orders, the Court allowed the Department of Homeland Security to proceed with deportations to third countries, including conflict zones, and to implement policy changes that lower courts had tried to block. Another decision held that Medicaid beneficiaries could not sue to enforce their statutory right to choose their provider, clearing a path for states to exclude Planned Parenthood and similar clinics from Medicaid without facing private lawsuits. Together, these rulings shifted power away from individuals and district judges and toward the executive and its allied state governments. They did not abolish judicial review, but they made it slower, narrower, and less able to halt a policy before it did its work. That change in tempo matters.\
\
At the same time, the Justice Department itself was moving away from the role of neutral enforcer. A whistleblower, former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni, alleged that Emil Bove, a senior official and nominee for a federal appeals court seat, had suggested ignoring court orders that blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. According to Reuveni, Bove argued that deportation flights could proceed so long as planes left U.S. airspace before written orders were entered, even when judges had issued verbal restraints. Other reporting described Bove\'92s role in firing prosecutors and FBI agents who had worked on January 6 cases, and in seeking to dismiss bribery and conspiracy charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for cooperation on immigration policy. When Bove appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he denied these accounts, but the pattern they described was clear: prosecutorial discretion and respect for court orders were being bent toward political ends. The same week, the Justice Department sued the entire bench of federal judges in Maryland over an order that required a one\uc0\u8209 day pause before deporting immigrants who had filed legal challenges. In this confrontation, the executive branch did not merely argue that a judge was wrong; it argued that the judge had no right to stand in its way. That is a different claim about law itself.\
\
If the Iran strikes and the court decisions marked a shift in the formal architecture of power, immigration enforcement showed how that power was being used on the ground. In Los Angeles and other cities, ICE and DHS intensified raids aimed at meeting a target of 3,000 arrests per day. Agents, often masked and in plain clothes, detained people on the street, at workplaces, and even at courthouses. Many of those arrested had no criminal record. Some were U.S. citizens. A 32\uc0\u8209 year\u8209 old citizen, Andrea Velez, was seized outside her workplace in downtown Los Angeles; witnesses said agents did not ask for identification and appeared to target her based on appearance. A 68\u8209 year\u8209 old Mexican\u8209 born man, Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado, died while being transported by private contractors from a local jail to a federal detention center. A pregnant woman, Iris Dayana Monterroso\u8209 Lemus, lost her baby after reporting starvation and denial of medical care in a Louisiana detention facility. Narciso Barranco, a landscaper and father of three U.S. Marines, was tackled, beaten, and pepper\u8209 sprayed during an arrest in Orange County, his shoulder dislocated as agents in masks pinned him down. In New Orleans, Mandonna \'93Donna\'94 Kashanian, a 64\u8209 year\u8209 old Iranian woman who had lived in the United States for forty\u8209 seven years, was detained while gardening outside her home, one of eleven Iranians arrested nationwide in the days after the strikes. These were not isolated abuses; they were the predictable outcomes of a system that had been given quotas, emergency rationales, and political cover. Fear was not a side effect; it was the point.\
\
The geography of this enforcement was not random. Los Angeles, with its large immigrant population and visible protests, became a focal point. The administration ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city, ostensibly to protect federal buildings and support immigration raids. California\'92s leaders objected, and the state sued to block the federalization of its Guard. A district judge initially sided with the state, warning of the precedent set by using military forces in domestic protests. An appeals court, however, temporarily upheld the federalization order, allowing the deployment to continue while litigation proceeded. On the streets, the presence of soldiers and Marines alongside masked ICE agents blurred the line between policing and war. Community health centers reported that no\uc0\u8209 show rates for appointments had tripled, as patients feared leaving their homes. Street vendors and small businesses saw their income collapse. In this setting, the law did not appear as a neutral framework; it appeared as a moving line, backed by uniforms and guns, that could cross into any neighborhood at any time. That is how federal power becomes a weapon against disfavored places.\
\
Behind the raids and deployments stood a growing infrastructure of detention. In Florida, state and federal officials advanced plans for a massive new migrant camp in the Everglades, quickly dubbed \'93Alligator Alcatraz.\'94 The facility, designed to hold up to 5,000 people in tents, would be guarded initially by 100 National Guard troops and funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA. Governor Ron DeSantis seized a 39\uc0\u8209 square\u8209 mile site from Miami\u8209 Dade County under emergency powers, bypassing normal environmental and local\u8209 governance processes. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued in federal court, arguing that the project could not proceed without a proper environmental study and that it threatened the fragile Everglades ecosystem. At the same time, ICE partnered with CoreCivic to convert a shuttered 2,500\u8209 bed prison in California City into the state\'92s largest immigrant detention center, backed by an initial $10 million contract. These moves deepened the role of private prison companies and emergency declarations in the architecture of immigration control. They also tied local economies to the continuation of mass detention, making it harder to unwind the system even if policy changed. Once built, such camps do not easily close.\
\
The week also revealed how citizenship itself was being stratified. The Supreme Court\'92s emergency orders allowing deportations to third countries, including conflict\uc0\u8209 ridden states, signaled that non\u8209 citizens could be moved as policy demanded, with limited recourse. The administration announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status for more than half a million Haitians, giving them just over two months to leave or find another status. At the same time, the White House explored agreements with fifty\u8209 three countries to hold deported individuals, many of them with poor human\u8209 rights records. In Congress, Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee called for the denaturalization and deportation of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who had just won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor. Ogles labeled Mamdani \'93antisemitic\'94 and a \'93communist\'94 and cited a statute allowing revocation of citizenship for those who misrepresented support for terrorism. He also sent a letter to the attorney general urging action. The House Homeland Security Committee\'92s Democrats condemned these remarks as \'93racist drivel,\'94 but the episode showed how the threat of denaturalization could be wielded against political opponents, especially those from minority communities. In the same week, the administration floated a plan to resettle 1,000 Afrikaners from South Africa while continuing to bar refugees from countries under the travel ban. The message was not subtle: who belongs, and who may stay, depends increasingly on origin, ideology, and usefulness to the regime. Citizenship was becoming a graded status, not a shared floor.\
\
While the executive and enforcement arms pushed outward, knowledge institutions were being reshaped from within. In public health, the central figure was Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier in the term he had fired all seventeen members of the CDC\'92s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the panel that guides vaccine recommendations, and replaced them with eight appointees known for spreading vaccine misinformation. In Week 23, that reconstituted panel met and voted to restrict the use of thimerosal in seasonal flu vaccines, despite decades of evidence showing no harm from the preservative and its use in only about five percent of vials. The vote was five in favor, one abstention, one against. Pediatricians and public\uc0\u8209 health experts warned that the decision could reduce vaccine availability, especially in low\u8209 income countries that rely on multi\u8209 dose vials. At a House hearing, Representative Kim Schrier accused Kennedy of lying to Senator Bill Cassidy about his plans for the committee during his confirmation. Kennedy denied making promises and defended deep budget cuts and office closures across the public\u8209 health bureaucracy as efforts to eliminate \'93duplicative\'94 functions. The same week, the Supreme Court decided Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, affirming the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\'92s preventive\u8209 services mandate but clarifying that the health secretary could remove members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at will and review their recommendations. In effect, the Court confirmed that a politically appointed skeptic of mainstream science now held sweeping power over the bodies that define preventive care for millions. Expertise was no longer a shield; it was subject to loyalty tests.\
\
The attack on independent knowledge did not stop at health. The Trump administration moved to dismantle Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, authorizing the termination of 639 employees in a single day. Since March, 1,400 positions had been eliminated, leaving the agency with just 250 staff. The administration had long derided VOA as \'93leftist propaganda\'94 and signaled its desire to fold its functions back into the State Department, where messaging could be more tightly controlled. A federal judge criticized the administration for failing to comply with an injunction related to earlier firings, questioning its commitment to statutory obligations. Yet the layoffs went forward, and the president called on Republican lawmakers to defund VOA entirely. At the same time, the White House and its allies escalated attacks on domestic media. The president demanded that CNN fire Pentagon correspondent Natasha Bertrand over her reporting on the Iran strikes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused the press of \'93cheering against\'94 the president and announced a criminal investigation into the leak of the DIA assessment. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for his part, sued Fox News and host Jesse Watters for defamation, seeking $787 million over a deceptively edited clip about his communications with Trump. The lawsuit underscored that courts remained a venue for contesting misinformation, but it also highlighted the degree to which political conflict had migrated into the realm of edited footage and narrative framing. Control of the story was becoming a central prize.\
\
Universities, long treated as semi\uc0\u8209 autonomous spaces for debate and research, came under direct federal pressure. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to revoke Harvard\'92s certification to host foreign students, accusing the university of fostering extremism and resisting oversight. A federal judge blocked the move, citing threats to free speech. The Justice Department opened an investigation into the University of California\'92s hiring practices, part of a broader campaign against perceived ideological bias in higher education. Most dramatically, the president of the University of Virginia, James Ryan, resigned under pressure as part of a settlement to end a DOJ investigation into the university\'92s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The administration had accused UVA of prioritizing race in admissions and student life. Ryan\'92s departure signaled that federal power could reach into the leadership of a flagship public university and reshape its policies by threat of legal action. These moves, taken together, showed universities that their funding, their ability to host international students, and even their presidents\'92 jobs could depend on aligning with the administration\'92s view of acceptable speech and diversity. Academic freedom was no longer an assumption; it was a contested space.\
\
The week\'92s judicial decisions on education and culture further narrowed the space for inclusive civic learning. In Mahmoud v. Taylor and related cases, the Supreme Court ruled that public schools must allow parents to withdraw their children from classes that include storybooks with LGBTQ+ characters on religious grounds. Justice Samuel Alito\'92s majority opinion emphasized parental rights in religious upbringing; Justice Sonia Sotomayor\'92s dissent warned that the ruling would encourage schools to strip inclusive content from curricula to avoid litigation. Authors and educators feared a wave of book removals and opt\uc0\u8209 outs that would make LGBTQ+ lives less visible in public education. In another case, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring age verification for access to pornographic websites, despite concerns about privacy and the chilling of lawful speech. These decisions did not directly censor content, but they created incentives for schools and platforms to err on the side of exclusion, especially where the content involved marginalized groups. Civic education, already strained by culture\u8209 war battles, risked becoming more fragmented and sanitized. What students learn about who counts as part of the \'93we\'94 would depend more on zip code and lawsuit risk.\
\
Amid these shifts, there were pockets of resistance and resilience. Federal judges ordered the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil and of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man accused of gang ties, after finding the government\'92s evidence insufficient. An appeals court in New York directed the administration to seek the return of Jordin Melgar\uc0\u8209 Salmeron, who had been deported to El Salvador less than thirty minutes after a court barred his removal. Environmental groups sued to halt the Alligator Alcatraz project until a proper environmental study could be conducted. Democratic attorneys general challenged the national \'93energy emergency\'94 declaration that sought to accelerate fossil\u8209 fuel projects. In New York City, voters chose Zohran Mamdani as the Democratic nominee for mayor, making him the first Muslim and South Asian candidate to win that primary and inspiring thousands of young progressives to consider running for office. A Quinnipiac poll showed that 64 percent of registered voters supported a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, and another survey found that a majority disapproved of the president\'92s handling of deportations. These developments did not reverse the week\'92s structural changes, but they showed that courts, civil society, and voters still had tools and were willing to use them. The floor was sagging, but it had not yet given way.\
\
The assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband, and their dog by a man posing as a police officer cast a long shadow over the week. Hortman was a prominent advocate for environmental protection and low\uc0\u8209 income Minnesotans. Her killing, along with the wounding of another state senator and his wife, was not just a personal tragedy; it was a direct attack on democratic representation. The assassin\'92s use of a police disguise blurred the line between legitimate authority and violent imposture, echoing the broader theme of the week: that the symbols of law and order could be turned against the very people they were meant to protect. Whether state and federal institutions would treat this as an isolated crime or as part of a pattern of political violence remained an open question. But in the context of denaturalization threats, death threats against Zohran Mamdani, and the labeling of dissenters as traitors or extremists, the killing suggested that the space for safe political participation was shrinking. Violence at the edge of politics was moving closer to its center.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 23, several processes were already in motion. The Senate was preparing for a final vote on the budget reconciliation bill, which contained historic Medicaid cuts, large tax changes, and increased funding for immigration enforcement. The administration had announced that Temporary Protected Status for Haitians would end on September 2, setting a hard deadline for hundreds of thousands of people. Lawsuits over the Alligator Alcatraz camp, the energy emergency, grant cancellations, and DOJ\'92s suit against Maryland judges were moving through the courts. Secret negotiations with Iran over sanctions relief and nuclear enrichment freezes were underway even as public rhetoric remained bellicose. The newly reconstituted vaccine and preventive\uc0\u8209 care bodies under RFK Jr. would soon face decisions that could reshape national health policy. And the Supreme Court\'92s narrowing of nationwide injunctions would govern how future challenges to executive orders, including those on birthright citizenship, could be brought. The structures set this week would frame the fights to come.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'978:01 p.m.\'97captured a system under mounting strain. Executive power had been exercised in ways that bypassed both Congress and, increasingly, the spirit of judicial review. Law enforcement and military forces had been used not only to address threats but to manage dissent, enforce quotas, and project fear into immigrant communities. Courts, while still issuing important rebukes, had also limited their own reach and aligned more often with executive and elite preferences, especially in immigration and health care. Institutions that once mediated between power and the public\'97public broadcasters, vaccine panels, universities\'97had been purged, repopulated, or threatened into compliance. The moral floor, already weakened, sagged further under the weight of unilateral war, mass deportation, disinformation, and self\uc0\u8209 dealing. The direction of movement was not in doubt.\
\
Yet the week also showed that the story was not finished. Judges ordered wrongfully deported people returned. Legislators invoked the War Powers Resolution and defended parliamentary rules against partisan pressure. Civil society groups protested in front of corporate offices and inside Senate buildings. Voters in New York City chose a candidate who campaigned on opposing ICE deportations and raising taxes on the wealthy. Polls suggested that the public\'92s views on immigration were more generous than the administration\'92s policies. These acts did not stop the clock from moving forward, but they kept open the possibility that it might one day move back. Week 23 matters in the larger arc of the term because it shows how quickly structures can tilt when emergency becomes routine, when law is treated as a weapon, and when memory and knowledge are curated by those in power. It also shows that even in such a week, there remain people and institutions willing to say no. The official time at the close of the period is 8:01 p.m. Whether that minute becomes a brief pause or the start of a long descent will depend on how these same actors respond in the weeks that follow.\
