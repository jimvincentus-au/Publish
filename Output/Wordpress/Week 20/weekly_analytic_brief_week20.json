    "The presidency expanded its practical reach over budgets, personnel, and borders, using executive orders, proclamations, and emergency appeals to reshape immigration, health, science, and federal workforce policy with minimal oversight.",
    "Congress functioned largely as a vehicle for the executive agenda, passing the Big, Beautiful Bill and advancing reconciliation measures that hardwire social retrenchment, deregulation, and donor-friendly provisions into law.",
    "The Supreme Court moved the needle toward deference to executive and corporate power via emergency orders on Doge data access, Social Security employment disputes, and gun and religious exemption cases, even as some lower courts resisted on immigration.",
    "Key agencies\u2014FEMA, NOAA, NWS, VA, NIH, and civil rights components of DOJ\u2014were hollowed out or redirected, weakening state capacity in disaster response, public health, and rights enforcement while empowering opaque entities like Doge.",
    "Media and educational institutions faced intensified pressure: funding threats and lawsuits against NPR/PBS, Pentagon and VA access restrictions, and targeted actions against Harvard and DEI-related teaching narrowed independent spaces for information and civic education."

  "oddities_or_open_questions": [
    "The Musk\u2013Trump feud exposes how deeply state capacity (NASA, ISS logistics, Doge, stablecoins) now depends on a small set of oligarchic actors; it is unclear whether this conflict will meaningfully check cronyism or simply reshuffle beneficiaries.",
    "Corporate backlash against Trump\u2019s anti-media order and Pride sponsorship pullbacks move in opposite directions, raising questions about whether business resistance will coalesce around rule-of-law concerns or remain fragmented and culture-war driven.",
    "The courts\u2019 mixed record\u2014blocking some deportations while enabling mass data access and shielding industries\u2014raises uncertainty about whether judicial resistance is episodic or can cohere into a durable counterweight to executive overreach."

  "summary": "This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian structural pressure, with the executive branch aggressively consolidating power while degrading multiple guardrails simultaneously. Trump\u2019s team signaled willingness to bypass Congress on spending and civil service purges, weaponized immigration and law enforcement against political opponents and protesters, and normalized sweeping travel bans and mass deportations. The House advanced the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill,\u201d embedding deep social cuts, deregulatory favors, and even non-reviewable mining leases, illustrating how legislative process is being used to entrench crony capitalism and environmental rollback. Courts were a mixed arena: some rulings protected migrants and speech, but the Supreme Court repeatedly used emergency orders to greenlight data grabs and union-hostile moves, and to shield industries like guns from accountability. Information control and memory politics intensified through attacks on NPR/PBS, censorship of VA scientists, historical erasures, and conspiratorial presidential messaging. Across immigration, reproductive rights, veterans\u2019 care, science agencies, and FEMA/NOAA, policy choices systematically shifted risk and suffering onto vulnerable groups while preserving elite advantage, indicating a regime that treats inequality and institutional chaos as governing tools rather than side effects.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Executive overreach and normalization of emergency logic: from impoundment threats and mass federal layoffs to sweeping travel bans and data centralization, the presidency is increasingly operating outside traditional legislative and judicial constraints.",
    "Weaponized immigration and policing: raids, collateral arrests, student deportation threats, and military deployments against largely peaceful protests show law enforcement being used to intimidate opponents and chill dissent, especially among immigrants and students.",
    "Legislating inequality and cronyism: the omnibus and reconciliation bills bundle tax cuts, social program cuts, AI preemption, and bespoke mining carve-outs, shifting wealth upward and embedding corporate and donor interests into statutory structure.",
    "Information, science, and memory under pressure: censorship of VA researchers, politicized education testimony, defunding public media, and symbolic erasures like the Harvey Milk ship renaming all work to subordinate truth and history to regime narratives.",
    "Judicial power as a contested battleground: lower courts occasionally check deportations and speech restrictions, but the Supreme Court\u2019s emergency stays and privacy-hostile rulings increasingly align with executive and corporate priorities."
