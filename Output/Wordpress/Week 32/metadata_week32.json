    "square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a gavel, a folded American flag partially wrapped in yellow police tape, a stack of redacted legal files labeled only with black bars, and a worn union badge beside a broken pocket watch stopped just after eight. In the background, out of focus, a television screen shows static where a news broadcast should be. Painterly, realistic lighting with deep shadows, evoking quiet erosion of rights and oversight.",
    "wide": "A dusk view of Washington, D.C., in painterly realism: the Capitol dome and Union Station under a hazy sky, streets lined with military vehicles and heavily armed but indistinct security forces at intersections. Federal buildings are draped in floodlights, while small groups of protesters with signs gather behind metal barricades. In the foreground, an oversized, old-fashioned clock face embedded in the pavement shows time edging past eight, its glass slightly cracked. The mood is tense and subdued, suggesting occupation rather than open conflict."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 32 records only a half\u2011minute advance on the Democracy Clock, yet the movement comes from a dense layering of control rather than a single rupture. In Washington, a manufactured \"crime emergency\" allowed the White House to seize operational command of D.C. policing, expand National Guard deployments, and treat the capital as a test bed for federal occupation, with threats aimed at Baltimore, Chicago, and other blue jurisdictions. Law enforcement and regulatory data were turned against critics and immigrants, even as elite\u2011linked cases like Epstein and Maxwell remained shrouded or leniently handled. Simultaneously, the administration drafted an order to end mail\u2011in voting, blessed gerrymandered maps, and attacked public and independent media, while taking a personal equity stake in Intel and rolling back wages, overtime, and union rights for millions of workers. Courts, civil servants, and organizers mounted scattered resistance, but the week\u2019s through\u2011line is normalization: emergency powers, lawfare, and crony economics settling into the grain of governance.",
