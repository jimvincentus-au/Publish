Newsom has been actively working to prevent the measure from reaching voters, citing concerns that it could drive billionaires and their investments out of California. The initiative, backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), aims to use the tax revenue to support the state's healthcare system and public education. Despite Newsom's efforts, the measure is gaining traction and could become a significant political issue.",

      "summary": "A federal appeals court reversed a lower court's decision that had ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former Columbia University graduate student, from ICE detention. The 2-1 decision by the third US circuit court of appeals found that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over Khalil's claims, as federal immigration law precluded it. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which seeks to deport Khalil, arguing his views threaten US foreign policy. The decision allows for Khalil's potential re-detention while his case continues in immigration court.",
