\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 27 Appendix: Law and Code as Weapons\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive consolidating power across law enforcement, regulation, information, and social policy. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fell on rule-of-law traits (4, 9, 22, 51), as DOJ and ICE were further politicized and expanded, consent decrees and police reforms were rolled back, and a new Obama-focused \'93strike force\'94 signaled overt use of prosecutorial power against political enemies. Regulatory and economic capture (16, 26, 38) deepened via crypto- and AI-friendly orders, agency purges, and politically conditioned mergers, while homelessness, immigration, and environmental policy were reframed as security or culture-war problems rather than rights or welfare questions. Information control and press targeting (42, 43, 52\'9654, 60) intensified through lawsuits, pool bans, AI propaganda networks, altered human-rights reporting, and historical document dumps used as distraction. There were meaningful countervailing judicial and civil-society actions\'97courts repeatedly blocking the birthright-citizenship order and protecting some immigrant rights; oversight pushes on Epstein files; grassroots mobilization around immigration and state-level democracy\'97but these gains were modest relative to the breadth of centralizing, punitive moves.\

\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump and the Environmental Protection Agency eliminated the EPA's research and development office and began mass layoffs (2025-07-19): The administration cut thousands of EPA staff and dismantled its research arm, weakening federal capacity to generate independent environmental science that informs regulation and public health protections.\
\
2. President Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates and suggested firing him (2025-07-19): Trump\'92s attacks on the Fed chair and hints at removal challenged the central bank\'92s independence, risking politicization of monetary policy that is meant to be insulated from short-term political interests.\
\
3. President Trump directed the attorney general to seek unsealing of Epstein grand jury testimony (2025-07-19): Ordering DOJ to pursue unsealing of sensitive grand jury materials in a politically charged case tested norms around prosecutorial independence and confidentiality safeguards in high-profile investigations.\
\
4. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard referred former President Obama and officials to DOJ for treason investigations over 2016 intelligence (2025-07-19): Referring a prior administration for treason based on claims contradicting prior bipartisan findings signaled use of national security institutions to pursue political retribution rather than evidence-based accountability.\
\

\

\
17. President Trump signed executive orders to accelerate AI development by easing environmental and permitting rules (2025-07-23): AI industrial policy orders prioritized rapid data center and fossil-fuel infrastructure buildout over environmental review, centralizing discretion over land use and climate impacts in the executive branch.\
\
18.
