    "summary": "This week demonstrated a continuation of authoritarian practices, with significant breaches of democratic norms, particularly in character, ethics, and restraint. The president's rhetoric and actions further eroded the moral floor, while some judicial and civil society responses provided limited resistance. The overall pattern suggests a deepening of existing erosive trends rather than the emergence of new ones.",

    "narrative": "The moral floor continues to deteriorate, with the executive branch increasingly treating public institutions as extensions of personal power. This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the static position of the Democracy Clock at 8:11 p.m.",
