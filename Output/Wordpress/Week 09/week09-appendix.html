<h1>Week 9 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance</h1>
<p><em>In Trump’s ninth week back in office, wartime statutes, deportation flights, and agency purges turned law and bureaucracy into pliable tools of executive will.</em></p>
<p>This week represents an acute stress test of American constitutionalism, with the executive branch openly defying courts, hollowing out key departments, and weaponizing immigration and education policy for ideological ends. The most intense structural pressure falls on rule of law and separation of powers: mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act proceeded in direct defiance of multiple federal orders, while Trump and congressional allies escalated attacks on Judge Boasberg, including impeachment articles and removal efforts. Simultaneously, the administration moved to dismantle the Department of Education, reassign student loans to the SBA, gut USAID and cultural agencies, and give Elon Musk’s DOGE sweeping access to federal systems—only partially checked by federal judges. Universities, immigrants, and protesters are targeted through funding freezes, visa revocations, and criminalization of activism, while independent media (USAGM/VOA, RFE/RL, AP access) is aggressively curtailed. Courts, state AGs, and some judges mounted significant resistance, securing TROs on deportations, DEI rollbacks, USAID, DOGE data grabs, and climate funds. But the pattern is clear: rapid executive overreach, privatization of state power, and normalization of constitutional brinkmanship.</p>
