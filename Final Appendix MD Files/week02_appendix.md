# Week 2 Appendix: Citizenship as Executive Property

This week represents an acute acceleration of authoritarian consolidation centered on the presidency. Trump’s team simultaneously attacked multiple guardrails: mass firings of inspectors general and FBI/DOJ prosecutors, Schedule F–style politicization of the civil service, and sweeping funding freezes that attempted to override Congress’s power of the purse. In parallel, the administration pardoned or commuted sentences for January 6 offenders and Stewart Rhodes, while dismantling public records and databases about the insurrection—normalizing paramilitary violence in defense of the regime. Immigration and citizenship became core tools of stratification: emergency powers, Guantánamo expansion, ICE quotas and raids in schools and churches, the Laken Riley Act, TPS rescissions, and an executive order to end birthright citizenship (temporarily blocked) all push toward a tiered legal order. A coordinated rollback of DEI, LGBTQ protections, and civil-rights enforcement across the military, federal workforce, prisons, and education system deepened structural inequality. Courts, state governments, civil society, and some Republicans mounted notable resistance—blocking the funding freeze, birthright order, and pushing lawsuits over civil service politicization and church raids—but the net structural pressure overwhelmingly favored executive dominance, crony capitalism, and a curated, amnesiac public memory.

29.

30.
