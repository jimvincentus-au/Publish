Week 28 of Trump’s second term closes with the Democracy Clock unmoved at 11:09 p.m., but the stillness masks a hardening landscape. Inside government, an AI “delete list” for regulations advances, public health advisory bodies are purged, and rescissions and impoundments test Congress’s power of the purse. Tariffs proliferate as instruments of presidential discretion, while Medicaid and SNAP cuts thin the safety net and signal a shift toward privatized risk. Immigration enforcement stretches law and conscience, from deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to FEMA-funded detention infrastructure and legal black holes like Alligator Alcatraz. Courts and states answer with lawsuits and injunctions—blocking a birthright citizenship order, protecting Planned Parenthood funding, defending transgender care, and probing detention abuses. The judiciary itself faces politicized appointments, intimidation, and executive complaints. Media and universities are pressured through licensing threats and funding freezes. The clock holds because resistance matches damage, not because the underlying strain has eased.
