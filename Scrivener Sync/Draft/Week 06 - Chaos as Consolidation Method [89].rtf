\
By Week 6, the pattern hinted at in earlier weeks came into full view. The presidency was no longer simply pushing against the edges of law and custom; it was rearranging the machinery of the state so that law, money, and force bent toward one center. The week\'92s events showed a government that still held elections, still issued rules, still convened courts, but whose inner workings were being rewired to serve loyalty, wealth, and fear. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 8:20 p.m., moved to 8:27 p.m. The seven\uc0\u8209 minute shift did not come from a single spectacular act. It came from a dense web of decisions that made it harder for any institution to stand between power and its aims. That is the change that matters.\
\
The move from 8:20 to 8:27 p.m. marks a modest but clear deepening of risk. Executive power, already strong, pushed further beyond effective oversight. Law, already strained, was used more openly as a weapon. The civil service, already under pressure, was treated as a disposable workforce to be purged, bought out, or bent to partisan ends. Wealth, already influential, bought not only access but relief from enforcement. Independent media, already harassed, found their access and role in the public square narrowed by design. Citizenship itself, already unequal in practice, was openly stratified by wealth, identity, and origin. Courts and civil society did push back in places, issuing injunctions, filing suits, and organizing boycotts. Yet the net effect of the week was to move more levers of state into the hands of a small circle and to make resistance more costly.\
\
One of the clearest lines of movement ran through the justice system. The attorney general\'92s new \'93weaponization working group\'94 inside the Justice Department was built to review supposed abuses of the criminal law over the prior four years, but it reported not to the attorney general\'92s own chain of command, nor to Congress, but to a White House policy aide. That reporting line mattered. It turned what might have been an internal audit into a political instrument, aimed at rewriting the story of past prosecutions and signaling that future cases would be judged by their loyalty to the president\'92s narrative. At the same time, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, Ed Martin, declared in public that he and his colleagues were \'93President Trump\'92s lawyers,\'94 not independent prosecutors sworn to the Constitution. The Civil Rights Division was ordered to drop lawsuits against police and fire departments accused of discriminatory hiring. Security clearances were suspended for lawyers who had represented the former special counsel. Together, these moves did not abolish the courts or the criminal code. They did something subtler and more dangerous: they taught the system that law would be used to shield allies, punish critics, and revisit settled cases when they cut against the leader\'92s interests.\
\
The mass pardons for January 6 participants, including Enrique Tarrio and roughly 1,500 others, fit the same pattern. They were framed as mercy for patriots wronged by a \'93weaponized\'94 Justice Department. In practice, they erased the consequences for a violent assault on the peaceful transfer of power. When Tarrio, newly freed, confronted officers like Michael Fanone and announced plans to sue the department that had prosecuted him, he was not acting alone. He was moving in a space the president had cleared for him, where violence in service of the leader could be forgiven and even rewarded. The pardons, and the later expansion of clemency to cover gun and drug charges, told future actors that if they broke the law on the right side of the barricades, the state might yet absolve them. Law, in this frame, was not a limit on power. It was a tool to be turned off and on.\
\
The same week saw courts trying to hold a line. Federal judges issued nationwide injunctions blocking the administration\'92s anti\uc0\u8209 DEI orders, finding likely violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. Other judges barred Elon Musk\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 from accessing vast troves of student, veteran, and employee data, citing privacy laws and the lack of a \'93need\u8209 to\u8209 know\'94 basis. Injunctions ordered the resumption of refugee admissions, foreign aid payments, and federal loans and grants that the administration had tried to freeze. A judge in California temporarily blocked mass firings of federal employees, ruling that the Office of Personnel Management likely lacked authority to order such reductions. These rulings did not reverse the week\'92s drift, but they showed that parts of the judiciary still saw themselves as limits on power rather than its servants. Yet even here, the pattern was mixed. The Supreme Court\'92s administrative stays on USAid payments and foreign aid gave the executive more time to resist compliance. A Trump\u8209 appointed judge declined to restore the Associated Press\'92s access to the Oval Office and Air Force One, accepting the administration\'92s distinction between \'93more private areas\'94 and general press access. The same SEC that had once sued Coinbase and Justin Sun now halted or dropped those cases after large donations flowed to Trump\u8209 aligned ventures. Courts were still present, but their rulings increasingly tracked the interests of donors and the executive.\
\
If law was being bent, the civil service was being broken and rebuilt. Elon Musk\'92s email demanding that every federal worker list five accomplishments or be deemed to have resigned was the most visible sign. It was later walked back by the Office of Personnel Management, which said non\uc0\u8209 response would not count as resignation, but Musk insisted that non\u8209 compliance could still lead to firing. Cabinet departments, from the FBI to the Defense Department, advised their staff to ignore the email or to pause responses. Unions amended lawsuits to argue that the directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Yet the message had been sent: job security now depended not on statute and merit, but on the favor of a private ally of the president. At the same time, OPM issued a memo directing agencies to reclassify top career positions as political appointments. The White House and budget office ordered agencies to prepare plans for mass layoffs and reorganizations by mid\u8209 March, identifying \'93non\u8209 essential\'94 staff and functions not mandated by law. The Social Security Administration announced a restructuring that could cut up to half its 57,000 employees. NOAA fired hundreds of probationary workers, including many hired through programs for veterans and people with disabilities. USAid staff were placed on leave and invited back only to collect their belongings. Twenty\u8209 one DOGE employees resigned rather than help dismantle public services or compromise sensitive data. The civil service was still there, but it was being turned from a neutral, protected corps into a precarious, politicized workforce.\
\
These changes did not occur in isolation. They were tied to a broader project of outsourcing state power to unaccountable private actors. DOGE, a new entity built around Musk, was given authority to oversee all federal payments\'97contracts, grants, and loans\'97through a centralized system that required justifications for each disbursement. A separate executive order froze all government credit cards for thirty days, halting purchases at NIH and other agencies, including supplies for cancer and Alzheimer\'92s research. The FAA signed a contract to use SpaceX\'92s Starlink system, deepening the dependence of a key regulator on a company controlled by the president\'92s ally. Musk attended the first Cabinet meeting, spoke more than almost any secretary, and discussed the \'93accidental\'94 cancellation of USAid funding for Ebola prevention. The line between public office and private influence blurred. Decisions about who would receive federal money, which research would continue, and which agencies would shrink were increasingly shaped in rooms where unelected figures like Musk held the floor.\
\
Wealth did not only buy influence; it bought relief from law. Coinbase, after contributing $75 million to a pro\uc0\u8209 crypto super PAC and $1 million to Trump\'92s inauguration, saw the SEC agree to dismiss its lawsuit without fines or changes to its business model. The same week, Coinbase listed Trump\'92s meme coin, $TRUMP, a heavily centralized token that generated at least $58 million in trading fees for the president and his associates. Justin Sun, charged with securities fraud, invested $75 million in a Trump\u8209 backed venture that funneled over $50 million to Trump. Soon after, the SEC halted its prosecution and joined Sun in asking for a stay to explore \'93resolution.\'94 Jared Kushner\'92s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, had already raised $4.6 billion from foreign sovereign funds, including $2 billion from Saudi Arabia, despite internal warnings about his inexperience and fees. Now he was at the center of plans to redevelop Gaza, pairing foreign policy with real estate. In this environment, the proposal to sell a $5 million \'93Trump Gold Card\'94 path to citizenship was not an outlier. It was a logical extension: citizenship itself became a commodity, available to those who could pay, while migrants and refugees without wealth faced detention, deportation, or death.\
\
The week also marked a sharp turn in how the state treated citizenship and belonging. Trump announced the \'93largest deportation operation in American history,\'94 framed as repelling an \'93invasion.\'94 ICE was directed to deport hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied children. Migrants were ordered to Guantanamo Bay, where reports described shackles, cages, strip searches, and isolation, with legal calls denied. Undocumented immigrants aged fourteen and older were required to register with USCIS and provide fingerprints, under penalty of law. The State Department ordered permanent visa bans on transgender athletes who \'93misrepresented\'94 their sex on applications. The administration proposed selling citizenship to the wealthy through the Gold Card. At the same time, the refugee admissions system was suspended until blocked by a court, and U.S. funding for UNAids and refugee health services along the Thai\uc0\u8209 Myanmar border was cut, leaving clinics closed and patients like Wah K\'92ler Paw and Pe Kha Lau without care. Citizenship and protection were no longer simply questions of law and humanity. They were sorted by wealth, identity, and political usefulness.\
\
Force and the institutions of force were being reshaped in parallel. The president fired General Charles Q. Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with Admiral Lisa Franchetti, Admiral Linda Fagan, and other senior officers, and moved to install a less qualified loyalist, General Dan Caine, as the new chair. Former defense secretaries warned that the purge threatened the nonpartisan character of the military and urged Congress to hold hearings and block nominees. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signaled plans to dismiss the judge advocates general of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, removing the lawyers who administer military justice and advise on the legality of orders. The Pentagon ordered the services to purge mentions of \'93diversity, equity, and inclusion\'94 from their websites and announced plans to remove transgender troops unless they obtained waivers. Tom Homan, the border czar, spoke of bringing \'93hell\'94 to sanctuary cities and suggested military involvement in domestic immigration enforcement. The designation of Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations opened the door to cross\uc0\u8209 border military action. Security forces were not yet openly turned against domestic opponents, but their leadership, legal oversight, and mission were being aligned with the preservation of the regime and its narratives.\
\
Information, too, was brought under tighter control. The White House seized authority from the White House Correspondents\'92 Association to decide which reporters could join the presidential press pool. The Associated Press and Reuters were barred from key events, including an Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky, while a Russian state outlet was initially admitted. A federal judge declined to grant AP emergency relief, leaving the ban in place. Trump called MSNBC a \'93threat to democracy\'94 and attacked individual journalists like Joy Reid as \'93mentally obnoxious racists.\'94 On social media he threatened to sue \'93dishonest authors and book publishers\'94 and floated laws against \'93defamatory fiction.\'94 The Department of Education launched an \'93End DEI\'94 portal inviting citizens to report diversity practices in schools. Science agencies were ordered to strip DEI programs and climate references from their websites. The Gulf of Mexico was renamed the \'93Gulf of America\'94 by executive order, and media that refused to adopt the term lost access. The Department of Justice released only a limited set of Jeffrey Epstein files to right\uc0\u8209 wing influencers, while withholding fuller records from congressional investigators. In each case, the goal was not to silence all criticism. It was to starve independent outlets of access, feed aligned voices with curated material, and rewrite the language and memory through which the public understands its world.\
\
Against this, there was resistance from below. Federal employee unions amended lawsuits to challenge Musk\'92s directives and DOGE\'92s data access. Twenty\uc0\u8209 one DOGE staff resigned rather than help dismantle public services or compromise core systems. Civil servants at Yosemite hung an upside\u8209 down flag on El Capitan to protest Musk\u8209 ordered firings. Protests were held at Tesla dealerships, linking corporate power to the administration\'92s actions. Americans across the country joined a one\u8209 day economic boycott, the \'93economic blackout,\'94 to protest cuts to DEI, healthcare, and social services. Maine\'92s governor defied the transgender sports order. Educator coalitions and teachers\'92 unions sued the Department of Education over anti\u8209 DEI guidance and funding threats. These acts did not stop the orders or the firings. But they showed that the civil service and civil society still contained people willing to risk careers and comfort to defend a different idea of public service.\
\
Abroad, the United States stepped away from its postwar role as a defender of democratic norms. At the United Nations, the U.S. delegation voted against a General Assembly resolution condemning Russia\'92s aggression in Ukraine, aligning with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus. A U.S.\uc0\u8209 drafted Security Council resolution took a more conciliatory line toward Moscow and passed with Russian support, over the objections of European allies. Trump refused to call Vladimir Putin a dictator while labeling Ukraine\'92s elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a dictator and falsely claiming Ukraine started the war. In the Oval Office, Trump and Senator J.D. Vance confronted Zelensky, demanding mineral rights and concessions in exchange for aid, and threatening to cut off military support. Plans were floated to halt all shipments of previously approved equipment. At the same time, Jared Kushner and a Trump envoy advanced a plan to \'93redevelop\'94 Gaza into a luxury resort after removing its Palestinian population, and Trump posted an AI\u8209 generated music video glorifying a \'93Trump Gaza\'94 hotel. Funding for UNAids was cut. Pressure was applied to Romania to lift travel bans on Andrew and Tristan Tate, and Romania soon allowed Andrew Tate to fly to Florida. The U.S. ambassador to Hungary warned that Viktor Orb\'e1n had turned his country into a system for a small elite, even as some American politicians praised him. The idea of America as a steady partner in defense of democracy and human rights was not formally renounced. It was hollowed out by choices.\
\
Within this landscape, some \'93what next\'94 points were already fixed. Agencies had been ordered to submit reorganization and layoff plans by March 13, setting a near\uc0\u8209 term date for further civil\u8209 service cuts. The Department of Education\'92s buyout offer to staff carried a Monday deadline, after which an executive order to abolish the department was expected. Court hearings were scheduled for the Associated Press\'92s access case and for challenges to DOGE\'92s data access and the anti\u8209 DEI orders. The Senate faced decisions on defense nominees like General Dan Caine and on the confirmation of Linda McMahon as education secretary. Tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China were set to take effect on March 4. These dates were not predictions; they were commitments already made in writing, points at which the trajectory of Week 6 would either be reinforced or contested.\
\
By the close of Week 6, the Democracy Clock stood at 8:27 p.m. That time does not mean collapse is imminent. It means that more of the structures that once slowed or corrected abuses are now themselves being reshaped to serve those abuses. Executive power operates with fewer effective checks. Law is more often a weapon than a limit. The civil service is more precarious and politicized. Wealth buys not only speech but outcomes in court and policy. Independent media are squeezed while state\uc0\u8209 aligned voices thrive. Citizenship is openly stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage. The week matters not because any single line was crossed, but because so many lines were moved at once, in ways that reinforce each other. Chaos\'97over grants, credit cards, layoffs, foreign aid, and foreign policy\'97was not an accident. It was a method, fragmenting attention and disabling accountability. In such a setting, the work of courts, unions, governors, and citizens who still act in good faith becomes both harder and more important. The clock\'92s new time records that their efforts, while real, were outweighed this week by the consolidation of power. The hour is still early enough for change, but later than it was.\
\
## Week 6 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. Attorney General Pam Bondi created a weaponization working group inside the Justice Department reporting to the White House (2025-02-22): The Justice Department formed a "weaponization working group" that reports to a White House policy aide, blurring lines between independent law enforcement and partisan political direction.\
\
2. President Donald Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio and roughly 1,500 January 6 participants (2025-02-22): Mass pardons for January 6 offenders removed legal consequences for an attack on Congress, signaling tolerance for political violence carried out on behalf of the president.\
\
3. President Donald Trump announced the largest deportation operation in American history (2025-02-22): Trump\'92s pledge to launch an unprecedented deportation campaign, alongside moves against birthright citizenship and protected status, concentrated executive power over millions of residents\'92 basic security.\
\
4. President Donald Trump threatened to cut federal funding to states that defied his transgender sports order (2025-02-22): Threatening to withhold federal funds from states over compliance with a culture\uc0\u8209 war executive order used fiscal coercion to force state policy alignment with presidential preferences.\
\
5. President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from women\'92s sports (2025-02-22): The ban on transgender athletes in women\'92s sports used federal power to restrict participation based on gender identity, raising questions about equal protection and state autonomy in education policy.\
\
6. Elon Musk and the Office of Personnel Management ordered federal workers to submit weekly accomplishment reports under threat of termination (2025-02-22): Musk\'92s ultimatum that non\uc0\u8209 responding federal employees would be treated as having resigned leveraged executive backing to intimidate the civil service and bypass normal personnel protections.\
\
7. President Donald Trump halted NIH grant review by blocking required Federal Register study section notices (2025-02-23): By stopping NIH from publishing peer\uc0\u8209 review panels, the administration effectively froze billions in research funding in defiance of a court order, centralizing control over scientific spending.\
\
8. Trump administration placed nearly all USAID staff on leave and moved to eliminate thousands of positions (2025-02-23): Putting most USAID staff on leave and planning to cut about 2,000 positions sharply reduced U.S. capacity to deliver foreign aid, concentrating foreign policy tools in the White House.\
\
9. President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America (2025-02-24): Ordering federal agencies to adopt a politically driven geographic renaming, and punishing outlets that refused, asserted presidential control over official language and public narratives.\
\
10. President Donald Trump expanded the Department of Government Efficiency\'92s authority over federal payments and credit cards (2025-02-26): Executive orders centralizing oversight of contracts, grants, loans, and freezing government credit cards shifted day\uc0\u8209 to\u8209 day spending power from agencies and Congress to a Musk\u8209 linked unit under presidential control.\
\
11. Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management directed agencies to prepare mass layoff and reorganization plans (2025-02-26): Central instructions to plan large\uc0\u8209 scale reductions in force across agencies used top\u8209 down executive power to reshape the civil service and weaken bureaucratic checks.\
\
12. President Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to identify and discharge transgender service members (2025-02-27): Directing the military to remove transgender troops within tight deadlines used commander\uc0\u8209 in\u8209 chief authority to exclude a class of citizens from service, undermining equal access to military roles.\
\
13. President Donald Trump moved to abolish the U.S. Department of Education and offered buyouts to its staff (2025-02-28): Preparing an order to dismantle the Education Department and pressuring employees with inferior buyouts threatened a core federal role in education policy and weakened an expert bureaucracy.\
\
14. Department of Health and Human Services under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to eliminate public participation in many policy decisions (2025-02-28): Removing opportunities for public comment on major health rules reduced democratic input into how a vast share of federal health spending and regulation is set.\
\
15. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration canceled key vaccine advisory meetings during a severe flu and measles season (2025-02-28): Canceling expert meetings on immunization practices and flu strain selection weakened evidence\uc0\u8209 based public health decision\u8209 making at a time of heightened disease risk.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Missouri state legislator introduced a bill to create a registry of pregnant women deemed at risk of abortion (2025-02-22): The proposed Save MO Babies Act would establish a state\uc0\u8209 managed database tracking pregnant women, expanding government surveillance into private reproductive decisions.\
\
2. Federal courts issued nationwide injunctions blocking Trump\'92s anti\uc0\u8209 DEI orders and Musk\'92s data access (2025-02-22): Judges in multiple cases halted enforcement of federal DEI bans and DOGE\'92s access to sensitive personal data, asserting constitutional and privacy limits on executive initiatives.\
\
3. Elon Musk called for impeachment of a federal judge who blocked DEI grant terminations (2025-02-22): Musk\'92s demand to impeach a judge over an adverse ruling attacked judicial independence and signaled that legal decisions could trigger personal retaliation.\
\
4. Federal employee unions and allied plaintiffs amended lawsuits challenging DOGE directives and OPM data sharing (2025-02-23): Unions expanded litigation to contest Musk\uc0\u8209 driven reporting mandates and data disclosures, using the courts to enforce procedural and privacy protections against executive overreach.\
\
5. Senator Angus King warned Congress that Trump\'92s funding refusals were an unconstitutional power grab (2025-02-24): King urged colleagues to confront the president\'92s practice of altering laws by refusing to fund them, framing it as a direct challenge to congressional power of the purse.\
\
6. Representative Gerry Connolly opened an investigation into U.S. Attorney Ed Martin for alleged abuse of office (2025-02-24): Congressional scrutiny of a U.S. attorney accused of targeting critics of Musk and DOGE tested legislative oversight tools against politicized law enforcement.\
\
7. Federal judiciary declined to immediately restore Associated Press access to presidential events (2025-02-24): Judges refused AP\'92s emergency requests to regain White House access after a naming dispute, effectively permitting temporary executive control over which outlets cover the president.\
\
8. U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear challenges to abortion clinic buffer zones (2025-02-24): By leaving lower\uc0\u8209 court rulings intact, the Court preserved local ordinances limiting protests near abortion clinics, balancing speech rights with access to medical services.\
\
9. Federal courts issued multiple injunctions against Trump administration freezes on loans, grants, refugees, and foreign aid (2025-02-25): Judges blocked attempts to suspend federal loans, refugee admissions, and foreign aid payments, reinforcing that the executive must follow statutory spending mandates.\
\
10. Teachers\'92 unions and civil rights groups sued the Department of Education over threats to cut funds for race\uc0\u8209 conscious policies (2025-02-25): The lawsuit challenged federal efforts to punish schools for considering race in hiring and policy, using litigation to defend educational equity norms.\
\
11. U.S. Supreme Court overturned Richard Glossip\'92s conviction and ordered a new trial (2025-02-25): The Court found prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence in a death\uc0\u8209 penalty case, underscoring judicial responsibility to correct serious due\u8209 process violations.\
\
12. Supreme Court of the United States temporarily stayed a lower\uc0\u8209 court order requiring USAID payments (2025-02-27): An administrative stay paused enforcement of a ruling compelling the administration to release $1.5 billion in USAID funds, delaying relief for contractors and NGOs.\
\
13. Federal courts blocked or limited Trump administration plans for mass federal employee firings (2025-02-27): Judges held that OPM likely lacked authority for sweeping probationary firings, temporarily protecting parts of the civil service from rapid politicized purges.\
\
14. North Dakota courts restricted public access and venue changes in Energy Transfer Partners\'92 lawsuit against Greenpeace (2025-02-27): A county judge denied livestreaming and venue change requests in a high\uc0\u8209 profile case against Greenpeace, prompting appeals over transparency and juror impartiality in litigation against activists.\
\
15. Coalition of educators sued to block Trump administration anti\uc0\u8209 diversity education guidelines (2025-02-28): Educators challenged new federal civil\u8209 rights guidance targeting DEI practices, arguing it undermines equal educational opportunity and conflicts with existing protections.\
\
16. Securities and Exchange Commission dropped or halted high\uc0\u8209 profile crypto enforcement cases after political donations (2025-02-28): The SEC\'92s decisions to end actions against Coinbase and Justin Sun without structural remedies, following large contributions to Trump\u8209 aligned efforts, raised concerns about regulatory independence from political finance.\
\
17. Federal Election Commission canceled an open meeting and later reported on closed Sunshine Act sessions (2025-02-28): The FEC\'92s cancellation of an open meeting and limited disclosure about closed\uc0\u8209 door sessions modestly reduced public visibility into how federal election rules are administered.\
\
\
### Economic Structure\
\
1. Pentagon announced layoffs of 5,400 civilian workers and broader workforce cuts (2025-02-22): Large civilian layoffs at the Defense Department reduced government capacity and signaled a broader push to shrink public\uc0\u8209 sector employment in favor of political priorities.\
\
2. Trump administration imposed or confirmed steep tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico (2025-02-22): New and reinstated tariffs on major trading partners risked higher consumer prices and retaliatory measures, using trade policy as a blunt political and economic tool.\
\
3. President Donald Trump proposed selling U.S. citizenship through a $5 million Gold Card program (2025-02-24): Offering a paid fast track to citizenship would formalize a two\uc0\u8209 tier system where wealth buys immigration advantages unavailable to ordinary applicants.\
\
4. U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget framework with deep Medicaid and safety\uc0\u8209 net cuts to fund large tax breaks (2025-02-25): The House budget resolution paired trillions in tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy with major reductions to Medicaid and other programs, shifting resources upward and weakening social protections.\
\
5. Congress debated budget proposals cutting healthcare and essential services to extend tax cuts (2025-02-23): Ongoing budget debates centered on reducing healthcare and basic supports for vulnerable Americans to finance renewed tax cuts, reinforcing policy choices that increase inequality.\
\
6. Coinbase and federal regulators combined large political spending with favorable SEC outcomes and listing of Trump\'92s meme coin (2025-02-25): Coinbase\'92s heavy donations to Trump\uc0\u8209 aligned efforts coincided with SEC leniency and listing of Trump\'92s $TRUMP token, illustrating how financial clout can shape regulatory and market conditions.\
\
7. Jared Kushner and Affinity Partners secured billions in foreign sovereign investments while influencing Middle East policy (2025-02-27): Kushner\'92s large investments from Saudi and other Gulf funds, alongside his policy role, blurred lines between private enrichment and U.S. foreign policy decision\uc0\u8209 making.\
\
8. Trump administration and Jared Kushner advanced plans to redevelop Gaza with private real estate interests (2025-02-27): Efforts to convene developers for a Gaza redevelopment scheme tied U.S. diplomatic power to potential private profit, raising corruption and self\uc0\u8209 dealing concerns in foreign policy.\
\
9. Trump administration removed online applications for several student loan repayment and consolidation programs (2025-02-28): Taking down key student debt relief forms disrupted borrowers\'92 access to income\uc0\u8209 driven repayment and consolidation options, increasing financial strain without legislative debate.\
\
10. Trump administration announced massive budget cuts and layoffs at NOAA, EPA, Social Security, and agriculture agencies (2025-02-28): Planned or executed deep cuts at climate, environmental, Social Security, and disease\uc0\u8209 control units weakened public goods provision and shifted risk from the state to individuals.\
\
11. President Donald Trump pressed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates while pursuing tariffs and tax cuts (2025-02-25): Trump\'92s public pressure on the Fed to lower rates, combined with inflationary fiscal and trade policies, risked politicizing monetary policy and destabilizing economic management.\
\
12. Federal Aviation Administration signed a contract to use SpaceX\'92s Starlink internet system (2025-02-25): The FAA\'92s Starlink contract deepened the government\'92s dependence on a firm led by a politically powerful insider, raising conflict\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 interest concerns in critical infrastructure.\
\
13. DoorDash and New York Attorney General reached a $16.75 million settlement over misused delivery worker tips (2025-02-27): The settlement forced DoorDash to repay workers for tips used to subsidize base pay, demonstrating state capacity to correct deceptive gig\uc0\u8209 economy pay practices.\
\
14. Paramount announced plans to roll back corporate DEI policies amid political pressure (2025-02-26): Paramount\'92s retreat from DEI initiatives illustrated how corporate governance can be reshaped by political campaigns, affecting workplace equality and representation.\
\
