\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 18 is a study in consolidation rather than shock. The House rams through a sprawling reconciliation package that locks in high-end tax cuts, slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and green incentives, and quietly funds mass deportation infrastructure while trimming courts\'92 contempt powers. Immigration policy becomes an explicit sorting mechanism: TPS for Venezuelans is terminated, visas are revoked en masse, refugees are rendered stateless, and white South Africans are fast-tracked, even as judges temporarily block some deportations and the dismantling of key agencies. The Supreme Court\'92s emergency orders advance a unitary executive theory over independent boards, while DOJ is repurposed to investigate perceived enemies and abandon civil-rights enforcement. Universities, journalists, and civil servants face direct retaliation, even as courts and new legal-defense networks push back. Crony capitalism is normalized through a Qatari jet and a crypto pay-to-play dinner. The Democracy Clock stays at 7:51 p.m., not from safety, but because resistance narrowly matches the week\'92s layered damage.\
