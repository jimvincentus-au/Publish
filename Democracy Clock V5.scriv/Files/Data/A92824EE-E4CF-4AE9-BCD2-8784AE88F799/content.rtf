By Week 35, the story is less about a single shock than about density. The week of September 13\'9619, 2025, reads as a time when many lines that once separated power from impulse were thinned at once. Immigration, policing, science, media, and money all moved a little closer to the president\'92s hand. Yet the Democracy Clock did not advance. It stayed at 7:58 p.m., not because the week was safe, but because the dangers it revealed were already built into the hour. What changed was not the time, but how clearly we could see what that time meant.\
\
The previous week had ended at 7:58 p.m., a point on the dial that marks a democracy still formally intact but under sustained pressure. At the close of Week 35, the clock remained at 7:58 p.m., with a net change of zero minutes. The stillness is deceptive. Executive power without effective oversight, law used as a weapon, federal force turned against disfavored cities, protest narrowed by \'93security,\'94 and independent media squeezed by regulators all intensified. But they did so along paths that were already open. The week did not break new ground so much as fill in the trenches that had been dug earlier. Courts and Congress did register some resistance: judges blocked certain deportations, preserved a Federal Reserve governor\'92s job, and dismissed an overreaching libel suit; lawmakers opened investigations and wrote letters. Those acts mattered. They kept the clock from jumping forward. They did not, however, restore any lost minutes.\
\
The clearest expression of unchecked executive power came through immigration and policing. On paper, Washington and the states still shared authority. In practice, the president treated cities and migrants as objects of command. Trump\'92s earlier federal takeover of Washington DC\'92s police department, justified by an \'93out\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 control\'94 crime wave that local leaders disputed, set the tone. Federal agents and National Guard troops remained in the district after the formal thirty\u8209 day seizure ended, and Trump openly threatened to repeat the move if the city did not cooperate with mass deportations. The message was plain. Local autonomy in the capital itself existed at the pleasure of the president, and emergency powers were no longer exceptional tools but recurring levers. That point was hard to miss.\
\
That same logic extended to Memphis and Louisiana. In Memphis, Trump signed an order creating the \'93Memphis Safe Task Force,\'94 embedding National Guard units alongside FBI, ATF, DEA, ICE, Marshals, and Justice Department personnel in city policing. Tennessee\'92s governor welcomed the deployment, but local officials warned of militarization in a city with historically low crime. In Louisiana, the administration drafted a plan to send a thousand Guard troops into New Orleans and Baton Rouge for law enforcement duties, contingent on a friendly governor\'92s request. These moves did not respond to hurricanes or riots. They treated routine urban crime and political disagreement as grounds for federalized force. The effect was structural. It normalized a presidency that can reach for troops whenever a city is Democratic\uc0\u8209 run, resistant on immigration, or simply useful as a stage.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the sharpest edge of this new order. ICE raids in Los Angeles, conducted with masked agents and unmarked vehicles, swept up immigrants and people perceived to be immigrants in scenes that echoed earlier eras of mass roundups. A Supreme Court ruling cleared the way, allowing warrantless immigration raids based on skin color, accent, or job and overturning a restraining order that had slowed such operations in California. In Georgia, a Hyundai plant raid detained hundreds of Korean workers, many with valid business visas, in what officials later called an \'93operational mistake.\'94 Those workers were held in overcrowded, degrading conditions, and the arrests sparked outrage in South Korea. In Illinois, ICE\'92s Operation Midway Blitz left a man dead at a traffic stop near a school, prompting the governor and members of Congress to demand an investigation. At the same time, ICE dramatically expanded its use of solitary confinement, placing more than 10,500 people in isolation in just over a year, with vulnerable detainees held the longest. The reopening of Angola prison\'92s notorious \'93Camp J\'94 as an ICE detention site under a new name, Camp 57, completed the picture: a civil immigration system borrowing the harshest symbols and practices of criminal incarceration.\
\
These were not isolated excesses. They were backed by law and by the redirection of federal capacity. The Justice Department charged healthcare workers in California with assaulting federal agents after they tried to shield a patient from ICE in a surgical center, turning medical ethics into a potential crime. ICE and DHS announced that assaulting their officers would be treated as a federal felony and broadened their definition of \'93threats\'94 to include actions like filming operations, blurring the line between oversight and obstruction. Roughly 20% of FBI agents, including nearly all of Baltimore\'92s domestic terrorism squad, were reassigned to immigration enforcement, leaving extremist groups with more room to operate. Anti\uc0\u8209 trafficking initiatives were cut back, and agents who once pursued child exploitation and terrorism were sent into worksite raids they barely understood. A federal judge in New York ordered improvements to harsh detention conditions in a Manhattan building, and another in Texas heard detailed allegations of abuse at the Dilley family center, but these interventions were remedial. They treated symptoms of a system whose core design now prioritized deportation quotas and spectacle over protection. That design was the point.\
\
At the same time, the administration rewrote who could belong. On one side of the ledger, Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual fee on each H\uc0\u8209 1B visa, a sum that would price many employers and applicants out of the program and raise serious questions about whether the executive can unilaterally set such charges. On the other, he issued an order creating the \'93Gold Card\'94 visa, offering expedited immigrant status to individuals and corporations willing to make million\u8209 dollar \'93gifts\'94 to the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to revoke visas for anyone who celebrated Charlie Kirk\'92s death, and visa revocations reportedly began. Texas enacted a law barring most nationals of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea from buying real estate, reviving the logic of alien land laws. An immigration appeals court ordered the deportation of Mario Guevara, an Atlanta journalist from El Salvador whose reporting had focused on immigration enforcement, despite an earlier bond decision and a path to residency. An immigration judge in Louisiana ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a pro\u8209 Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident, deported for alleged misstatements on his green card form, even as a federal court blocked immediate removal. Together, these actions drew a bright line. Wealth and ideological alignment opened doors; poverty, disfavored nationality, or dissenting speech closed them.\
\
Law, in this environment, served power more often than it constrained it. The most vivid example was Trump\'92s designation of \'93antifa\'94 as a major terrorist organization. There is no statute that allows a president to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, and antifa itself is a loose label rather than a structured entity. Yet the announcement, amplified by talk of using treason and sedition laws against those who \'93identify\'94 with antifa and by discussions of RICO charges against protesters, did its work. It recast a broad swath of left\uc0\u8209 leaning activism as terrorism in the public mind and signaled to prosecutors and agents that certain targets were fair game. Stephen Miller\'92s warning that law enforcement power would be used against \'93domestic terrorists\'94 on the left, and Attorney General Pam Bondi\'92s threats to employers who failed to fire workers who disparaged Charlie Kirk, fit the same pattern. Dissent was not simply wrong; it was disloyal, perhaps criminal. That was the new frame.\
\
The Justice Department\'92s choices reinforced that message. Prosecutors in Virginia were pressured to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political adversary of Trump, despite investigators finding no evidence. When U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert declined to manufacture a case, the president prepared to fire him, jeopardizing ongoing espionage and terrorism prosecutions in his office. Bondi\'92s decision to open a civil rights investigation into an Office Depot employee who refused to print Kirk posters inverted the purpose of civil rights law, turning a statute meant to protect marginalized groups into a tool for compelling private speech in favor of a favored activist. At the same time, the department sued Vermont to strike down its Climate Superfund Act, siding with major polluters against a state law that would make them pay for emissions\uc0\u8209 driven damage, and joined the EPA in attacking similar efforts in New York. In Georgia, the state\'92s sweeping RICO case against Cop City protesters was thrown out by a judge who found the attorney general lacked authority to bring it, a rare instance where courts pushed back against the use of conspiracy law to criminalize protest. But in immigration, the Supreme Court\'92s blessing of warrantless raids and an appeals court\'92s order deporting a journalist like Guevara showed how often judicial outcomes now aligned with enforcement priorities.\
\
Federal power was also turned against disfavored jurisdictions. The DC police takeover and threats of renewed emergency control were one form. Another came through Congress. House Republicans advanced a slate of \'93tough on crime\'94 bills for Washington DC, including a measure to try children as young as fourteen as adults and to limit judges\'92 discretion in sentencing. These bills, some already passed by the House, imposed federal criminal policy on a city without voting representation in Congress. North Carolina\'92s HB 958, poised for a vote, promised to change election rules in ways critics said would rig outcomes, while Missouri\'92s mid\uc0\u8209 decade gerrymander aimed to convert a Democratic congressional seat into a Republican one. In Texas, foreign\u8209 buyer land restrictions targeted specific national origins. Each move had its own justification. Together, they showed a federal and state architecture willing to override local will and equal representation when it served partisan ends. That willingness is now routine.\
\
If force and law were one arm of this week\'92s story, information and memory were the other. The administration and its allies moved aggressively to shape what the public could see and hear. The Justice Department quietly removed a study from its website that had concluded, over three decades of data, that far\uc0\u8209 right extremists committed more ideologically motivated homicides than any other domestic group. The timing\'97just after Kirk\'92s murder, which some on the right blamed on \'93the Left\'94 despite the shooter\'92s lack of political affiliation\'97was not accidental. It cleared space for a narrative in which left\u8209 wing violence was the central threat. The Pentagon cut off atmospheric and oceanic data to civilian scientists and forecasters, citing cybersecurity, hampering climate modeling and weather prediction. The EPA proposed rescinding the greenhouse gas endangerment finding, the legal foundation for federal climate regulation, and planned to dismantle its own research office. At Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. purged the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, fired CDC Director Susan Monarez after she resisted politicized vaccine directives, and installed vaccine skeptics on the panel that guides national immunization policy. A contract with Moderna for a bird flu vaccine was canceled, and mRNA vaccine funding was slashed. These were not mere policy shifts. They were efforts to bring science under direct political control, to decide which facts would be funded, published, or believed.\
\
Media freedom came under direct regulatory pressure. FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened ABC and its affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel\'92s jokes about Kirk\'92s killing, suggesting that broadcasters could face consequences for airing his show. Nexstar, the largest operator of ABC affiliates, announced it would stop carrying Kimmel. ABC, owned by Disney, suspended the program. Sinclair Broadcast Group, whose owner is a Trump supporter, filled the time slot with a one\uc0\u8209 hour tribute to Charlie Kirk and demanded that Kimmel apologize and donate to Turning Point USA. Carr opened investigations into NPR and PBS over sponsorship practices and signaled that mergers involving companies with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs could face obstacles. At the same time, he approved a merger between Skydance and Paramount, with a Trump donor installed as an ombudsman at CBS News. House Democrats called for Carr\'92s resignation and opened investigations into the FCC, ABC, and Sinclair, framing the episode as an abuse of regulatory power to punish critical speech. But the immediate effect was clear. A major late\u8209 night critic of the president was off the air, and a pro\u8209 regime narrative filled the gap.\
\
The pressure extended beyond broadcast. The Washington Post fired columnist Karen Attiah over social media posts about white men in the context of Kirk\'92s killing, prompting calls for subscription boycotts and raising questions about how much room journalists had to speak frankly about race and violence. Attorney General Bondi told employers they had an \'93obligation\'94 to fire workers who disparaged Kirk, encouraging private censorship in the workplace. President Trump threatened ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl with Justice Department targeting after a tough question, and later suggested that TV networks that covered him negatively could face government punishment, even hinting at revoking licenses that networks do not actually hold. International outlets like Australia\'92s ABC were excluded from a joint press conference with Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, following earlier threats against an ABC journalist. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 aired \'93Trump v The Truth,\'94 a program cataloging more than a hundred presidential falsehoods with fact\uc0\u8209 checks, an external attempt to restore some balance to an information environment increasingly tilted at home.\
\
Even the nation\'92s historical record was not spared. The administration ordered the removal of slavery\uc0\u8209 related exhibits and signs from national parks, including a photograph of a formerly enslaved man, narrowing the story the state tells about its own past. The National Archives appointed a new Senior Executive Service performance review board, a routine act on its face, but one that took on added weight in a context where archives and records could be steered toward sanitization. In Congress, a resolution honoring Charlie Kirk as a \'93courageous American patriot\'94 passed with Republican support and a divided Democratic caucus. It condemned political violence, but it also canonized a polarizing activist whose Christian nationalist politics had helped define the movement. Public funds and rituals\'97flags at half\u8209 staff, Medals of Freedom, House resolutions\'97were increasingly used to sacralize a particular political\u8209 religious ecosystem. That sacralization now shapes who counts as a model citizen.\
\
Against this tide, there were pockets of resistance and resilience. A federal appeals court blocked Trump\'92s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, preserving the central bank\'92s independence for the moment and signaling that not all institutions would accept presidential control over monetary policy. The Ninth Circuit upheld Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans, rejecting the administration\'92s effort to end the program. A federal judge halted the deportation of Guatemalan unaccompanied children with active cases, criticizing unproven government claims about parental wishes. Another judge ordered improvements to immigrant detention conditions in Manhattan, finding likely constitutional violations. In Vermont, youth climate activists brought a lawsuit challenging Trump\'92s pro\uc0\u8209 fossil\u8209 fuel executive orders as unconstitutional state\u8209 created dangers, testing whether courts would recognize government\u8209 driven climate harm as a rights issue. In Georgia, the Cop City RICO case was largely dismissed for lack of proper authority. A federal judge in Florida dismissed Trump\'92s $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times as a rant that failed basic pleading standards, reinforcing legal protections for the press. In Minnesota, voters elected Democrat Xp Lee to fill the seat of murdered House Speaker Melissa Hortman, restoring a tied legislature and signaling that political violence had not yet succeeded in reshaping the state\'92s balance of power.\
\
Civil society, too, pushed back. New York City and state lawmakers were arrested while blocking access to an ICE intake facility, insisting on seeing detainees\'92 conditions and accepting federal misdemeanor charges to make their point. In Chicago, protesters, including congressional candidates, blocked ICE vehicles until federal agents in riot gear used teargas and pepper balls to clear them, a show of force that drew criticism but also drew attention. The University of California sued the administration over a research funding freeze and a $1.2 billion fine on UCLA, arguing that civil rights laws were being twisted to suppress academic freedom. The NC Poor People\'92s Campaign organized the Durham Rising March and Rally for workers\'92 rights. Activists in Britain projected an image of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle during his state visit, forcing uncomfortable associations into the official pageantry. West Coast states formed their own health alliance and issued independent vaccine guidelines after federal advisory bodies were purged, choosing to anchor their policies in scientific evidence rather than Washington\'92s new line.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 35, several processes were already in motion. The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for November 5 on the legality of Trump\'92s global tariffs under the emergency economic powers law, a case that would define how far a president can go in reshaping trade without Congress. The Court was also asked to decide whether Trump could fire a Federal Reserve governor, a question with direct bearing on central bank independence. Congress faced a looming government shutdown as the Senate blocked a House funding bill that failed to protect Medicaid and other health programs, and House Republicans tied increased security funding for elites to a stopgap measure. House and Senate Democrats launched investigations into the FCC, ABC, Sinclair, and the administration\'92s role in Kimmel\'92s suspension, testing whether legislative oversight could still check regulatory abuse. The Justice Department\'92s lawsuits against Oregon and Maine over voter data, and the North Carolina election bill, signaled further fights over who controls the machinery of elections. And in the background, the EPA\'92s move to rescind the endangerment finding, the Pentagon\'92s data cutoff, and HHS\'92s vaccine purges set up longer\uc0\u8209 term confrontations over whether evidence or ideology would guide national policy.\
\
In the moral terms that underlie the Democracy Clock, Week 35 showed a civic covenant under strain across all six pillars. Character was bent toward loyalty and spectacle rather than service, as seen in the use of flags, medals, and House resolutions to honor a partisan activist while other victims of political violence received less attention. Ethics were compromised by the monetization of public tragedy, the UAE chip and crypto deals that blurred public duty and private gain, and the use of law to harass opponents rather than curb corruption. Restraint eroded as emergency powers became routine tools for domestic policing and as federal force was turned against cities and protesters. Truthfulness suffered under removed studies, repeated election lies, and the sidelining of scientific expertise. Good faith in democratic engagement waned as legislatures became stages for symbolic punishment and as appointments and prosecutions were openly tied to loyalty. Stewardship faltered in the gutting of environmental and labor protections and the redirection of resources away from the vulnerable toward those closest to power.\
\
Yet the clock did not move. That is the deeper lesson of this week. By 7:58 p.m., the structures that allowed executive overreach, weaponized law, stratified citizenship, and curated memory were already in place. Week 35 did not invent them. It showed how they work when used to their full extent. Courts could still say no in some cases. Congress could still investigate. States could still chart their own course on vaccines. Voters in Minnesota could still elect a successor to a murdered leader. These acts of resistance mattered enough to hold the line, but not enough to reclaim any ground. The hour remained the same, while the room inside that hour grew more crowded with examples of what it permits.\
\
The official end\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 period time therefore stays at 7:58 p.m. Week 35 matters in the larger arc of the term because it reveals a regime settling into its tools. Emergency deployments, terror labels for domestic opponents, pay\u8209 to\u8209 enter visas, regulatory threats against media, and the rewriting of science and history are no longer experiments. They are habits. The democracy remains broadly functional. Elections are held. Courts sit. Protests occur. But the cost of using those rights rises, and the distance between law on paper and law in practice widens. In such a setting, the absence of clock movement is not comfort. It is a warning that the danger has become ordinary.\
