    "square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: an open law book with a page on habeas corpus, a small American passport partially covered by a stamped visa denial, and a gleaming model of a luxury jet resting atop a folded flag. Beside them sits a brass desk clock stopped at 7:59, and a stack of redacted legal memos tied with twine. In the background, shelves hold a few remaining books while others lie in a box labeled only with a barcode, hinting at removed titles. The lighting is dramatic and painterly, with sharp contrasts between light on the objects and a shadowed backdrop.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit cityscape of Washington, D.C., with the Capitol and federal buildings in the middle distance, seen through a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. In the foreground, a large, old-fashioned clock face is embedded in the pavement, its hands frozen just before 8 p.m. Around it, shadowed figures stand in separate groups: migrants behind portable floodlights, suited lobbyists emerging from a sleek private jet marked only with a foreign flag, and students holding protest signs blurred into silhouettes. Government buildings glow with an amber light while parts of the scene are in deep shadow, suggesting selective illumination. The style is painterly and realistic, with muted colors and a tense, compressed atmosphere."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 17 of Trump\u2019s second term left the Democracy Clock frozen at 7:59 p.m., but the machinery behind it tightened. The administration openly toyed with suspending habeas corpus for migrants, explored labeling border crossings a \u201crebellion\u201d or \u201cinvasion,\u201d and leaned on the Alien Enemies Act to accelerate deportations, even as courts issued injunctions and due\u2011process rulings that partially slowed the drive. Immigration and security tools were turned inward: ICE arrested Newark\u2019s mayor at a detention\u2011facility protest, disability\u2011rights activists and campus demonstrators were swept up, and critics from Hasan Piker to James Comey faced border questioning or threat investigations. At the same time, citizenship and protection were recast along racial and ideological lines, with selective refugee offers, TPS termination for Afghans, and executive orders targeting non\u2011citizens\u2019 views while the Supreme Court heard challenges to Trump\u2019s birthright\u2011citizenship order. Foreign money and personal enrichment, centered on Qatar\u2019s $400 million jet and a $5.5 billion golf project, blurred public policy with private gain. Independent media, universities, libraries, and the civil service absorbed fresh blows, even as scattered courts, agencies, and civil\u2011society actors kept pockets of rule\u2011bound governance alive.",
