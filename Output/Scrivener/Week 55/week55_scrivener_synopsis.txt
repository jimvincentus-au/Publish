Week 55 of Trump’s second term left the Democracy Clock fixed at 8:12 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked intense structural movement. Federal immigration forces operated as domestic security troops in Minneapolis and beyond, killing civilians, surrounding schools, and gassing largely peaceful protesters while courts and local officials issued only partial restraints. The Justice Department and FBI seized 2020 ballots in Georgia, sued states for full voter rolls, and paired a proof‑of‑citizenship order with rhetoric about ICE at polling places, advancing a federalized, securitized vision of elections. Inside the state, civil‑service protections and whistleblower safeguards were stripped back, police‑misconduct oversight was gutted, and public funds and foreign investments increasingly intertwined with Trump‑linked ventures and personal branding demands. Simultaneously, museums, school terminology, and heavily managed Epstein files showed history and scandal being edited from above. Resistance—from judges, state voting‑rights bills, protests, and investigative outlets—held the line but did not reverse these trajectories.
