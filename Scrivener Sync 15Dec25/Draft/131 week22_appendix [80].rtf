\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 22 Appendix: Law, Force, and Memory\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, heavy politicization of law enforcement, and a sharp erosion of protections for vulnerable groups, especially immigrants and LGBTQ people. Trump\'92s assertion of direct control over U.S. Steel, repeated defiance or manipulation of statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delays, National Guard federalization, DHS oversight rules), and deregulatory favors to crypto and fossil-fuel interests all push toward unchecked, personalized rule. Immigration enforcement is openly weaponized against Democratic cities and individual officials, while congressional oversight of detention is obstructed. Political violence escalates with the Minnesota assassinations, amid right\uc0\u8209 wing disinformation that inverts blame. Simultaneously, courts deliver mixed signals: the Supreme Court entrenches anti\u8209 trans policy and opens new avenues to attack state climate rules, even as lower courts block some discriminatory grant cuts, firings, and funding leverage. Civil society mobilization is massive (No Kings protests, local resistance to ICE), but met with militarized responses and chilling rhetoric from governors and federal agencies. Information and memory systems are reshaped through mass layoffs at Voice of America, symbolic purges in the White House, and rollback of Juneteenth and DEI recognition, signaling a broader authoritarian narrative project.\
\
Week 22 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump issued executive orders targeting sanctuary cities for defunding and prosecution of officials (2025-06-14): The orders sought to punish sanctuary jurisdictions and criminalize local resistance to federal immigration enforcement, expanding direct presidential leverage over cities and officials that oppose his policies.\
\
2. President Trump attempted by executive order to cancel birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants (2025-06-15): The order directly challenged a long\uc0\u8209 standing constitutional guarantee, signaling willingness to unilaterally redefine citizenship and legal status for a large class of residents.\
\
3. President Trump ordered mass ICE deportation focus on Democratic\uc0\u8209 run cities via social media directives (2025-06-15): By directing immigration raids toward political opponents\'92 jurisdictions, the president used federal coercive power in a partisan manner that can chill opposition and distort representation.\
\
4. President Trump and senior aides reversed a brief pause on workplace immigration raids in key industries after pressure from hardliners (2025-06-17): The rapid reversal showed immigration enforcement being driven by ideological and political demands rather than stable policy, heightening uncertainty for workers and employers.\
\
5. President Trump announced concessions and carveouts in immigration enforcement for agriculture and hospitality sectors (2025-06-15): Exempting certain industries from raids while intensifying enforcement elsewhere tied the use of state power to economic allies and donors, rather than neutral legal principles.\
\
6. President Trump deployed National Guard and active\uc0\u8209 duty Marines to Los Angeles over state objections to police protests (2025-06-15): Federalizing state forces to manage largely local protests without gubernatorial consent concentrated coercive power in the presidency and weakened state control over domestic security.\
\
7. President Trump threatened to withhold federal disaster aid from California over political disputes (2025-06-18): Using disaster relief as leverage against a political rival state signaled willingness to condition basic federal support on political compliance, undermining equal treatment of states.\
\
8. President Trump asserted permanent veto power and board influence over U.S. Steel through a special share arrangement (2025-06-18): Securing direct presidential control over a major private corporation blurred boundaries between state authority and private enterprise, raising risks of politicized economic decisions.\
\
9. President Trump extended by executive order the enforcement delay of the TikTok divestiture law despite statutory and judicial deadlines (2025-06-19): Unilaterally suspending enforcement of a congressionally mandated, court\uc0\u8209 upheld requirement asserted executive primacy over both legislature and judiciary in regulating a major communications platform.\
\
10. President Trump ordered Michigan coal plants to remain open under a national energy emergency authority (2025-06-20): Invoking emergency powers to override state climate law and planned closures entrenched presidential control over energy choices and favored fossil interests over state policy and public input.\
\
11. President Trump held a large military parade in Washington, D.C., on his birthday with corporate sponsorship (2025-06-14): The spectacle used military symbols and public resources to elevate the leader\'92s personal image, normalizing leader\uc0\u8209 centric displays more common in less democratic systems.\
\
12. President Trump removed the Martin Luther King Jr. bust from the Oval Office and declined to document its relocation (2025-06-15): Altering prominent civil\uc0\u8209 rights symbolism in the presidential office without transparency signaled a shift in the administration\'92s public commitments to racial equality and historical memory.\
\
13. President Trump replaced Hillary Clinton\'92s official First Lady portrait with a painting of himself in a White House display (2025-06-18): Substituting his own image for a predecessor\'92s in an institutional portrait space personalized state symbolism and edited official memory without process.\
\
14. President Trump publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and questioned his continued role (2025-06-18): Presidential denunciations of the central bank chief threatened the perceived independence of monetary policy, which is important for economic stability and insulation from partisan pressure.\
\
15. President Trump made escalating public statements about Iran including calls for unconditional surrender and warnings to evacuate Tehran (2025-06-18): Maximalist rhetoric about Iran\'92s surrender and potential strikes raised the stakes of presidential war\uc0\u8209 making decisions and risked committing the country toward conflict without clear congressional authorization.\
\
16. President Trump called for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 election as fraudulent (2025-06-19): Renewed demands for criminal investigation of a settled election kept false fraud claims central in presidential messaging, undermining confidence in electoral outcomes and peaceful transfer of power.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. U.S. District Court and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued conflicting rulings over federal control of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles (2025-06-19): A district judge ordered Guard control returned to California\'92s governor, but the appeals court allowed Trump to retain command, highlighting tensions over federal versus state authority in domestic deployments.\
\
2. Federal courts ruled that Trump administration\'92s NIH grant terminations were illegal and discriminatory and ordered restoration of funding (2025-06-16): By finding the cuts racially and anti\uc0\u8209 LGBTQ discriminatory and void, the judiciary checked executive attempts to reshape research funding along ideological lines.\
\
3. U.S. District Court in Boston issued an injunction allowing transgender and intersex people to update gender markers on passports despite an executive order (2025-06-17): The ruling protected access to accurate federal identification for trans and intersex citizens, pushing back against an executive attempt to restrict recognition of gender identity.\
\
4.

\
5. Federal appeals court rejected Trump\'92s bid to have DOJ lawyers represent him in the E.

\
6. Federal courts blocked several Trump administration attempts to terminate grants and fire civil\uc0\u8209 rights staff at federal agencies (2025-06-18): Judges halted EPA environmental justice grant cancellations, mass firings at Education\'92s Office for Civil Rights, and some DOJ grant terminations, preserving program capacity and checking politicized restructuring.\
\
7.

\
9. U.S. District Court temporarily blocked the administration from removing Harvard from the student visa program and banning its international admissions (2025-06-20): The injunction protected a university\'92s ability to enroll foreign students, defending academic autonomy against punitive immigration\uc0\u8209 linked sanctions.\
\
10. U.S. District Court ordered the release on bail of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention (2025-06-20): The decision signaled judicial concern that immigration detention was being used punitively against a political activist, reinforcing due\uc0\u8209 process protections.\
\
11. Florida federal court held the state attorney general in contempt for enforcing a blocked immigration law (2025-06-18): Finding the attorney general in contempt for defying a restraining order underscored that state officials must comply with federal court rulings, even on contentious immigration issues.\
\
12. Supreme Court and lower federal courts limited DOJ representation for Trump and blocked Education Department civil\uc0\u8209 rights firings (2025-06-18): These rulings collectively constrained efforts to use federal legal and civil\u8209 rights machinery for personal or ideological ends, preserving some institutional independence.\
\
13. American Bar Association and nonprofit coalitions filed lawsuits challenging executive orders targeting law firms and terminating DOJ violence\uc0\u8209 prevention grants (2025-06-16): Legal challenges by professional and civil\u8209 society groups sought to defend judicial independence and funding for vulnerable communities against politicized executive actions.\

\
15. Congressional Democrats launched inquiries and legislation targeting Trump\'92s cryptocurrency ventures and pardons (2025-06-17): Investigations into presidential crypto dealings and a bill to bar officials from profiting off such ventures sought to curb conflicts of interest and quantify the public cost of pardons.\
\
16. Government Accountability Office found the Trump administration illegally froze congressionally approved funds for libraries, archives, and museums (2025-06-16): The GAO determination documented an unlawful impoundment of cultural\uc0\u8209 institution funding, highlighting executive disregard for appropriations law and impacts on public memory institutions.\
\
17. Department of Homeland Security issued guidance requiring 72 hours\'92 notice for congressional visits to immigration detention facilities (2025-06-19): By imposing advance\uc0\u8209 notice rules contrary to statute, DHS restricted lawmakers\'92 ability to conduct surprise inspections, weakening real\u8209 time oversight of detention conditions.\

\
24. U.S. Senate confirmed Rodney Scott as CBP commissioner on a party\uc0\u8209 line vote despite misconduct allegations (2025-06-18): Approving a nominee accused of covering up a death in custody signaled tolerance for alleged abuses in a major enforcement agency and may weaken accountability norms.\

\
Economic Structure\
\
1.

\
3. President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a $5 million \'93Trump Card\'94 residency program offering permanent U.S. residency (2025-06-16): Creating a high\uc0\u8209 priced residency track commodified immigration status, privileging wealthy applicants and deepening stratification in access to legal residence.\
\
4.

\
10.

\
11. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey ended state\uc0\u8209 sponsored Juneteenth events and removed it as a paid holiday for workers (2025-06-18): Rolling back official recognition of Juneteenth reduced state support for commemorating emancipation and aligned with broader efforts to curtail DEI\u8209 related observances.\
\
12.

\
18. Chinese government and state\uc0\u8209 linked banks continued heavy manufacturing subsidies and redirected lending from real estate to industry, fueling price wars (2025-06-20): China\'92s industrial policy of subsidized overproduction and shifting credit toward manufacturing created deflationary pressures and global competitive distortions with implications for democratic economies.\

\
4.

\
5. ICE and local law enforcement arrested and transferred journalist Mario Guevara to ICE custody after he covered protests (2025-06-16): Detaining a long\uc0\u8209 time immigration reporter and handing him to ICE despite a valid work permit raised alarms about using immigration tools to target the press.\

Protesters and peacekeepers in Salt Lake City were involved in a fatal shooting during a No Kings protest (2025-06-15): The death of a demonstrator and injury of an armed individual during protest security efforts underscored the risks of firearms at political gatherings and the complexity of self\uc0\u8209 policing.\
\
10. Minnesota gunman Vance Boelter assassinated state Rep. Melissa Hortman and wounded Sen. John Hoffman and spouses in a politically motivated attack (2025-06-14): The targeted killing and wounding of elected officials at their homes represented a grave escalation of political violence against democratic representatives.\
\
11. Federal and state prosecutors charged Vance Boelter with murder, attempted murder, stalking, and firearms offenses for the Minnesota attacks (2025-06-17): Bringing extensive state and federal charges signaled that authorities view political assassinations as a top\uc0\u8209 tier threat requiring strong legal response.\
\
12. Texas Department of Public Safety evacuated the state capitol after credible threats tied to an anti\uc0\u8209 Trump rally (2025-06-14): Security threats forcing evacuation of a legislative building illustrated how intimidation can disrupt normal democratic activity and public protest.\
\
13. Los Angeles District Attorney and federal prosecutors filed state and federal charges against individuals involved in protests against ICE raids (2025-06-17): Felony charges and overlapping prosecutions for protest\uc0\u8209 related conduct raised concerns that criminal law was being used to deter dissent against immigration enforcement.\

\
17. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered a passive approach to Juneteenth messaging at the Pentagon (2025-06-19): Directing the military\'92s public affairs office to downplay Juneteenth aligned defense communications with broader efforts to retreat from DEI and racial\uc0\u8209 justice recognition.\
\

\
26. Trump administration canceled a large H5N1 vaccine contract with Moderna and imposed restrictive vaccine trial rules (2025-06-20): Halting vaccine development funding and mandating saline\uc0\u8209 placebo trials risked delaying lifesaving vaccines in future pandemics, with disproportionate impact on at\u8209 risk groups.\
\
27. Trump administration issued a stop\uc0\u8209 work order for the LGBTQ\u8209 focused national suicide hotline (2025-06-18): Ending specialized crisis support for LGBTQ callers reduced tailored mental\u8209 health resources for a vulnerable population with elevated suicide risk.\
\
28.

\
29. Florida and federal immigration authorities conducted intensified ICE operations in Lake Worth Beach, Florida, in coordination with local police (2025-06-18): Sweeping raids in a heavily immigrant city, including at schools and churches, led to widespread fear and family separations, affecting access to services and rights.\

Trump administration and DHS expanded or considered expanding travel bans and social\uc0\u8209 media vetting for foreign nationals (2025-06-14): Plans to add dozens of countries to travel bans and scrutinize visa applicants\'92 online speech tightened ideological and origin\u8209 based filters on entry to the United States.\
\
\
Information, Memory and Manipulation\
\
1.

\
2.

3. Right\uc0\u8209 wing media figures and Senator Mike Lee spread misinformation portraying the Minnesota lawmaker assassin as a leftist and blaming Democrats (2025-06-17): False narratives about the attacker\'92s ideology and responsibility for the killings distorted public understanding of political violence and deepened polarization.\
\
4. Trump administration terminated 639 employees at Voice of America and USAGM and issued further layoff notices (2025-06-20): Mass layoffs at the U.S. international broadcaster sharply reduced its reach and capacity, weakening an independent platform for U.S. news and democratic messaging abroad.\
