\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 32 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance\
\
This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the executive moving aggressively on three fronts: militarized control of Democratic jurisdictions, weaponization of law enforcement and regulatory power against opponents and vulnerable groups, and structural attacks on labor, public health, and electoral fairness. Plans and orders to federalize policing and deploy National Guard units in Washington, Chicago, Baltimore, and sanctuary cities, plus creation of specialized Guard units, push traits 1, 5, 9, and 11 sharply toward entrenched emergency rule. Parallel DOJ and ICE actions\'97politically targeted investigations, coercive plea tactics, opaque transfers, and retaliation against detainees and whistleblowers\'97intensify law-as-weapon dynamics (trait 4) and stratified citizenship (trait 47). The firing of CDC director Susan Monarez, installation of an unqualified loyalist, and mass resignations at CDC mark a serious blow to civil service independence and science-based governance (traits 16, 22, 53). On the socioeconomic side, nationalization-lite of Intel, deep labor rollbacks, and tariff shocks embed crony capitalism and inequality (traits 16, 35, 36, 38). Simultaneously, redistricting maneuvers, threats to mail voting, and litigation over maps escalate structural manipulation of representation (trait 45), even as a few court rulings and state-level elections show residual democratic resistance.\

\
3. President Trump announced lawyers were drafting an executive order to eliminate mail-in balloting nationwide (2025-08-24): Planning an executive order to end mail-in voting would centralize control over election mechanics in the presidency, threatening access to the ballot and bypassing normal legislative processes.\
\
4.

\

\
16. President Trump and the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a rule banning VA doctors from performing abortions except to save a patient\'92s life (2025-08-29): The proposed VA abortion ban used executive control over veterans\'92 healthcare to sharply restrict reproductive rights for women veterans, limiting medical autonomy within a federal system.\

\
8. Representative Andy Biggs introduced a bill to extend federal control of Washington, D.C.\'92s police for six months by default (2025-08-25): Legislation to lengthen federal takeovers of D.C. policing would normalize extended congressional and executive control over local law enforcement, weakening home rule.\
\

\
17.

Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump announced drafting of an executive order to eliminate mail-in balloting (2025-08-24): The president\'92s plan to end mail-in voting would sharply restrict a widely used voting method, potentially reducing turnout and altering electoral access without legislative debate.\

\

\
22. President Trump ordered a federal takeover of Union Station in Washington, D.C. (2025-08-28): Assuming control of a major transportation hub under a beautification rationale extends federal physical presence in the capital and may facilitate security or political staging.\
