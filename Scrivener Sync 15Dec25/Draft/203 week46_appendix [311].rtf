\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 46 Appendix: Citizenship as Sorting Mechanism\
\
This was a structurally heavy week of democratic backsliding, centered on three domains: immigration authoritarianism, impunity for elite lawbreaking, and normalization of extrajudicial violence. The administration aggressively weaponized immigration tools\'97pausing asylum adjudications, halting or re\uc0\u8209 reviewing benefits for nationals of 19+ countries, expanding travel bans, and conducting mass raids in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Boston, sometimes in open defiance of court orders. Simultaneously, Trump\'92s pardon and clemency spree for corrupt politicians, financial fraudsters, and a convicted narco\u8209 president, combined with DOJ moves to strip PREA protections for LGBTQ+ prisoners, signaled that law is an instrument of power, not a constraint. Overseas and at sea, the Hegseth\u8209 directed boat strike campaign, defended by the White House even as IG reports documented security breaches, pushed the U.S. toward a standing, legally dubious \'91war\'92 against drug traffickers. There was meaningful resistance\'97federal courts blocking warrantless immigration arrests, appellate rulings against illegal U.S. attorney appointments, congressional investigations into war crimes, and mandated unsealing of Epstein records\'97but these safeguards mostly operated in rear\u8209 guard fashion against an executive willing to ignore or rewrite rules.\
\
Week 46 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hern\'e1ndez, convicted of drug trafficking (2025-12-01): By pardoning a foreign leader convicted of major narcotics crimes, the president used clemency to shield a powerful ally from accountability, weakening the deterrent effect of U.S. drug laws and signaling selective enforcement of justice.\
\
2. President Trump commuted the prison sentence of fraud executive David Gentile (2025-11-30): Commuting the sentence of a financier convicted in a $1.6 billion fraud case signaled that well-connected white-collar offenders can escape full punishment, undermining equal application of the law and public trust in financial regulation.\
\
3. President Trump granted clemency to Representative Henry Cuellar, indicted in a foreign bribery scheme (2025-12-03): Pardoning a sitting member of Congress accused of large-scale bribery used executive power to insulate a politically useful lawmaker from trial, weakening deterrence for corruption and blurring lines between legal accountability and partisan loyalty.\
\
4. President Trump issued a full pardon to entertainment executive Tim Leiweke facing a corruption case (2025-12-04): Ending a federal corruption prosecution against a well-connected executive without explanation reinforced the perception that elite defendants can secure impunity through presidential favor rather than legal process.\
\
5. President Trump issued more than 2,000 pardons and commutations in 2025, many benefiting allies and elites (2025-12-04): An unprecedented volume of clemency for politically connected or wealthy figures turned the pardon power into a routine tool of patronage, eroding the rule of law and reinforcing a two-tier justice system.\
\
6. President Trump publicly threatened to strip citizenship from certain naturalized immigrants (2025-11-29): Threatening denaturalization for disfavored groups framed citizenship as a revocable privilege tied to political or ethnic identity, undermining constitutional guarantees and creating a hierarchy of belonging.\
\
7. President Trump claimed that all documents signed by former President Biden using an autopen were invalid (2025-12-03): Asserting that a predecessor\'92s autopen-signed acts, including pardons, are void challenged settled practice and suggested a president can unilaterally nullify prior lawful decisions, destabilizing continuity of government.\
\
8. President Trump held a cabinet meeting marked by praise for controversial military actions and false claims (2025-12-02): Using a cabinet meeting to glorify alleged war crimes and repeat demonstrably false narratives normalized disregard for legal and factual constraints at the highest level of executive decision-making.\
\
9. President Trump directed USCIS to pause adjudication of all pending asylum applications (2025-12-04): Ordering a blanket halt to asylum decisions for roughly 1.5 million applicants converted a statutory protection into a discretionary privilege, deepening executive control over who can seek refuge and when.\
\
10. President Trump announced plans to void immigration benefits and re-review approvals for nationals of 19 countries (2025-12-03): Ordering re-review of already granted benefits for people from selected states made lawful status contingent on shifting political judgments, undermining legal certainty and equal treatment in immigration.\
\
11. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced plans to expand the U.S. travel ban to more than 30 countries (2025-12-05): Expanding a nationality-based travel ban further tied access to the United States to broad security labels on entire countries, entrenching origin-based discrimination in border policy.\
\
12. Secretary of Justice Pam Bondi issued a memo directing law enforcement to investigate antifa and similar groups for tax crimes (2025-12-05): Ordering tax investigations of ideologically defined groups under a domestic terrorism label used prosecutorial tools to target political opponents, blurring the line between security policy and partisan repression.\
\
13. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo eliminating enforcement of sexual abuse protections for LGBTQ+ people in prisons (2025-12-05): Directing prisons to stop complying with PREA standards for LGBTQ+ inmates removed safeguards for a vulnerable group, signaling that their bodily security is subordinate to ideological priorities.\
\
14. Department of Veterans Affairs leadership created an internal database of non-citizen workers to share with immigration enforcement agencies (2025-12-03): Building an immigration-focused database inside a health agency repurposed personnel records for enforcement, chilling non-citizen participation in public service and intertwining care institutions with deportation machinery.\
\
15. Department of Homeland Security leadership planned increased ICE deployments targeting Somali residents in Minneapolis (2025-12-04): Targeting a specific ethnic community for intensified deportation operations, following derogatory presidential rhetoric, used federal power in a way that blurred security aims with ethnicized punishment.\
\
16. Department of Homeland Security leadership launched a large-scale immigration crackdown in New Orleans under Operation Catahoula Crunch (2025-12-04): Deploying hundreds of agents to make thousands of arrests in a Democratic-led city illustrated how federal enforcement surges can be used to project power and intimidate targeted communities and local governments.\
\
17. Department of Homeland Security leadership oversaw ICE operations that deported a student in defiance of a federal court order (2025-12-04): Removing a long-resident student despite an emergency judicial stay showed executive agents willing to ignore court orders in immigration enforcement, directly challenging judicial authority and due process.\
\
18. Department of Homeland Security leadership directed ICE agents who used pepper spray and force against protesters and a member of Congress in Tucson (2025-12-05): Allowing federal agents to use chemical agents on peaceful demonstrators and a sitting representative during an immigration raid blurred lines between law enforcement and suppression of political oversight.\
\
19. Department of Homeland Security leadership oversaw ICE hiring of 10,000 deportation officers with lax vetting and large bonuses (2025-12-03): Rapidly expanding deportation staff with weak screening increased the risk of abuse and politicization in frontline enforcement, embedding a more aggressive posture toward immigrants into the bureaucracy.\
\
20. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick acknowledged that mass deportations were depressing private-sector job numbers (2025-12-03): Admitting that deportation policy was harming employment underscored how security-driven decisions were reshaping the economy, with costs borne by workers and small businesses rather than policymakers.\
\
21. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche warned corporate lawyers that criticizing the administration\'92s white-collar enforcement approach could hurt clients\'92 treatment (2025-12-04): Linking leniency in corporate prosecutions to public deference from defense counsel suggested that prosecutorial discretion might be conditioned on political loyalty, undermining impartial justice.\
\
22. President Trump used social media to call for denaturalization and a purge of immigrants after a crime by an Afghan national (2025-11-29): Framing a single violent incident as justification for mass denaturalization and expulsions used inflammatory rhetoric to prepare public opinion for collective punishment of immigrant communities.\
\
23. President Trump publicly referred to Somali immigrants as \'93garbage\'94 in Oval Office remarks (2025-12-04): Dehumanizing a specific immigrant group from the presidency normalized stigmatization of minorities and provided rhetorical cover for harsh enforcement measures targeting them.\
\
24. Stephen Miller argued publicly that Afghan immigrants should be judged as a group rather than as individuals (2025-12-05): Promoting collective judgment of Afghan immigrants advanced an ideological frame that treats entire nationalities as security risks, supporting policies that curtail individual rights based on origin.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Senate and House Armed Services Committees announced and began oversight inquiries into alleged unlawful boat strikes ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (2025-12-02): Launching bipartisan investigations into suspected war crimes by senior defense officials exercised congressional war-powers oversight and tested whether the legislature can check potentially unlawful uses of force.\
\
2. Former JAGs Working Group issued a statement declaring Hegseth\'92s alleged orders to kill survivors would constitute war crimes and urged prosecution (2025-11-30): Former military lawyers publicly labeling the alleged orders as war crimes reinforced legal norms governing armed conflict and pressured institutions to enforce accountability for senior officials.\
\
3. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the disqualification of Alina Habba as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey (2025-11-30): Affirming that the administration could not bypass Senate confirmation for a key prosecutorial post reinforced constitutional appointment procedures and limited politicized control of federal prosecutions.\
\
4. Federal district court in Virginia ruled that Lindsey Halligan\'92s appointment as U.S. attorney was illegal and dismissed her politically sensitive cases (2025-12-02): Invalidating an improperly appointed U.S. attorney and tossing prosecutions against high-profile Trump critics showed courts acting as a check on politicized use of prosecutorial power.\

5. Federal grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia declined to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on federal fraud charges (2025-12-03): A grand jury\'92s refusal to revive charges after an earlier case was thrown out for appointment irregularities underscored resistance to perceived retaliatory prosecutions of a state official.\
\
6.

\
7.

\
8.

\
9. Bipartisan group of U.S. senators and representatives pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi for a briefing on the status of Epstein files (2025-12-04): Lawmakers demanding clarity on Epstein records signaled cross-party concern that the Justice Department might selectively shield politically sensitive information, reinforcing legislative oversight of transparency commitments.\
\
10. House Democrats on the Oversight Committee released new photos and videos from Jeffrey Epstein\'92s private island (2025-12-03): Publishing visual evidence from Epstein\'92s property ahead of a records-release deadline used congressional authority to keep pressure on the Justice Department for full disclosure in an elite abuse case.\

\
14. U.S. Supreme Court approved Texas\'92s redrawn congressional map adding several Republican-leaning districts (2025-12-05): Allowing a map previously found to dilute minority voting power to stand elevated partisan and procedural concerns over equal representation, entrenching structural advantages for one party.\
\
15. U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Trump\'92s order restricting birthright citizenship (2025-12-05): Taking up a case on limiting birthright citizenship put the Court in position to redefine the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, with major implications for who is recognized as a citizen.\
\

\
2.

\
15.

\
16.

\
17.

\

\
21. Colorado Attorney General settled with Dollar General for $400,000 after repeated pricing inspection failures (2025-10-01): Forcing a large retailer to correct chronic overcharging reinforced state capacity to police deceptive practices in markets serving financially vulnerable consumers.\
\

\
23.

\

\
5.
