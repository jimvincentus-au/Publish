Executive\u2013legislative balance eroded further through unilateral foreign strikes, foreign-aid redirection, TikTok defiance of statute and court, and Supreme Court stays that expand presidential reach over independent agencies and appropriated funds. Immigration and civil-rights policy were used as tools of stratified citizenship and political retribution, with ICE mass detention of non\u2011criminals, high-profile detentions, and huge deportation funding. Climate and housing civil-rights enforcement were rolled back while green and preservation funds were clawed back, deepening regulatory capture and inequality. There were pockets of resistance\u2014federal court pushback on grants and emergency funds, state and regional public-health alliances, congressional oversight on Homan and ICE deaths, and Adelita Grijalva\u2019s election\u2014but these were outweighed by coordinated efforts to politicize the civil service, intimidate lawyers and media, and normalize chaos as a governing strategy.",
