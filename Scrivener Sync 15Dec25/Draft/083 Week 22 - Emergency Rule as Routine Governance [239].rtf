In Week 22, the pattern that had been forming since the start of Trump\'92s second term came into clearer view. The presidency was no longer only a powerful office within a constitutional system; it was being used as a hub from which almost every major lever of state power could be pulled in service of personal rule, partisan advantage, and a narrowing idea of who counts as fully American. Immigration raids, coal plants, social media platforms, public health budgets, even the portraits on the White House walls were drawn into that orbit. At the same time, millions of people filled the streets under the banner \'93No Kings,\'94 courts issued sharp rebukes to some of the most extreme moves, and lawmakers in both parties tried to reassert war powers and ethics rules. The week\'92s story is not a simple slide. It is a contest in which one side now holds most of the hard power.\
\
On the Democracy Clock, the public time at the end of the previous period was 8:00 p.m. It remains 8:00 p.m. at the close of Week 22, but the underlying measure edged three-tenths of a minute closer to midnight. That small numerical shift masks a more important change in texture. The week did not bring a single spectacular break, like a canceled election or a formal suspension of the Constitution. Instead, it layered many smaller moves that made emergency rule feel more normal, turned law into a tool rather than a boundary, and deepened a hierarchy of citizenship based on wealth, ideology, and heritage. The clock holds because resistance\'97judicial, civic, and legislative\'97was real and sometimes effective. It moves because the balance of power between those forces and the executive continues to tilt in one direction.\
\
The most visible front in that struggle was immigration. Early in the week, the administration\'92s numbers told their own story: an 807% increase in arrests of immigrants with no criminal record since January, driven by a directive from Stephen Miller to hit a target of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE agents swept Home Depot parking lots, swap meets, garment factories, and Latino parishes in Los Angeles, Lake Worth Beach, and other communities. They detained U.S. citizens and DACA recipients alongside undocumented workers, barred lawyers and members of Congress from seeing detainees, and left families unsure where their relatives had been taken. The raids were not just about enforcing immigration law. They were about showing that the federal government could reach into any neighborhood, at any time, and that due process would follow, if at all, on the government\'92s terms.\
\
At the same time, the White House was explicit about where that power would fall. Trump used his social media platform to order ICE to focus on \'93Democrat Power Centers\'94 like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, and to frame those cities as havens for \'93illegal aliens\'94 who supposedly bolstered Democratic votes. The administration briefly paused worksite raids in agriculture and hospitality after protests and complaints from farmers and hotel owners, then reversed course within days under pressure from hardliners. Donor-heavy industries were carved out again, while raids intensified in opposition-led cities. The pattern was clear. Federal power was being used against disfavored regions and spared where it might hurt allies, turning immigration enforcement into a partisan map.\
\
Inside that map, the line between law and politics blurred further. Florida\'92s attorney general continued to enforce a state immigration law that had been blocked by a federal judge, instructing police to make arrests anyway until he was held in contempt and ordered to report every new arrest. DHS issued guidance that defied a federal appropriations statute by requiring 72 hours\'92 notice before members of Congress could visit detention centers, then used that guidance to deny entry to New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman at 26 Federal Plaza. In New York City, ICE and FBI agents arrested the city comptroller and mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, outside immigration court as he tried to accompany a Spanish-speaking immigrant whose case had been dismissed. They accused him of assaulting officers; video showed agents roughly handling him; the charges were dropped within hours. The message was not legal clarity. It was that those who tried to stand between the state and its targets could themselves become targets.\
\
The same logic reached into the courts and the border. On his first day back in office, Trump had signed an order canceling 30,000 asylum appointments booked through the CBPOne app, stranding families who had followed the rules and waited months in dangerous Mexican border towns. This week, that decision\'92s human cost came into sharper focus as shelters emptied and migrants were left in limbo. At the same time, the administration considered adding 36 countries, including 25 in Africa, to an expanded travel ban, and the State Department rolled out new rules requiring foreign students and scholars to unlock their social media accounts for ideological vetting. The criteria included \'93hostility\'94 toward U.S. citizens, culture, or institutions and opposition to Israel\'92s actions in Gaza. Citizenship and lawful presence were being sorted not only by paperwork but by perceived loyalty and wealth, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a waitlist for a $5 million \'93Trump Card\'94 that would offer permanent residency to those who could pay.\
\
Against this backdrop, the boundary between civilian policing and military force continued to erode. In Los Angeles, protests against the raids and deportations began as peaceful marches and vigils. They were met with teargas, foam bullets, mounted police, and curfews. Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty marines to the city without the governor\'92s consent, the first such move since the 1960s. A federal district judge ordered control of those units returned to Governor Gavin Newsom, but the Ninth Circuit stayed that order and later ruled that Trump could maintain control, citing evidence of violence at protests. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hinted he might not comply with adverse rulings. The effect was to normalize the idea that the president could federalize state forces and send marines into American streets over state objections, and that courts might bless such moves as long as the administration could point to disorder.\
\
The same pattern played out at a different scale overseas. As Israel\'92s air campaign against Iran intensified, the United States moved refueling tankers to Europe and ordered a second carrier group, the USS Nimitz, to the Middle East. Trump boasted on social media that the U.S. had \'93complete and total control\'94 over Iranian airspace and demanded Iran\'92s \'93unconditional surrender,\'94 then said he would decide within two weeks whether to join Israel\'92s strikes on nuclear facilities. He left the G7 summit in Canada a day early, dismissing European leaders as irrelevant to the crisis and criticizing the decision to expel Russia from the G8. At home, lawmakers in both parties introduced war powers resolutions to require congressional authorization before any attack on Iran, and Senator Bernie Sanders moved to bar the use of funds for unauthorized strikes. The institutional script of shared war powers remained on paper. In practice, the president was moving carriers and setting deadlines on his own.\
\
While troops and ships moved, the machinery of public health and science was being hollowed out. The CDC had already retracted $11.4 billion in Covid funding in March, cutting support for testing, vaccination, and surveillance at every level of government. On April 1, it fired officials responsible for the bird flu response, and by this week only about 50 people exposed to sick animals had been tested nationwide. The administration canceled a $766 million contract with Moderna for an H5N1 vaccine and imposed new rules requiring all vaccines to be tested against saline placebos, a standard that would slow approvals in any fast-moving outbreak. Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw Covid and RSV hospitalization data, resigned rather than lend her name to vaccine policy she no longer believed would be grounded in objective analysis. Former members of the CDC\'92s vaccine advisory committee, fired earlier by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., warned that their removal and staffing cuts at the agency were undermining the vaccine program\'92s success.\
\
Courts pushed back on some of these moves. A federal judge ruled that the administration\'92s termination of over $1 billion in NIH research grants was \'93void and illegal,\'94 finding that the cuts discriminated against racial minorities and LGBTQ researchers and ordering the grants reinstated. Another judge blocked the EPA\'92s cancellation of $600 million in environmental justice grants, preserving funding for communities disproportionately affected by pollution. A separate court temporarily halted mass firings at the Department of Education\'92s Office for Civil Rights, and yet another blocked the administration from removing Harvard from the Student and Visitor Exchange Program, which would have barred it from admitting international students. These rulings did not rebuild the capacity already lost at CDC or HHS. They did show that when executive actions crossed clear legal lines, the judiciary could still act as a brake.\
\
In other areas, the courts moved in the opposite direction. The Supreme Court upheld Tennessee\'92s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, ruling that it did not constitute sex-based discrimination, and in doing so narrowed the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s equal protection clause for transgender youth. The Court also allowed fossil fuel companies and Republican-led states to challenge California\'92s long-standing waiver to set stricter car emission standards than federal law, opening a path to weaken one of the country\'92s most important climate tools. These decisions, combined with the confirmation of Rodney Scott as CBP commissioner despite allegations of a cover-up in a death-in-custody case, signaled a judiciary increasingly aligned with conservative policy and corporate interests even as lower courts checked some executive excesses.\
\
Economic power and public office grew more tightly intertwined. Trump announced that he had secured a special class of stock in U.S. Steel that gave him a permanent veto over the company\'92s actions and influence over its board, a \'93golden share\'94 arranged by Commerce Secretary Lutnick. The administration ordered two Michigan coal plants to remain open under a national energy emergency authority, overriding state plans to close them and Michigan\'92s law requiring 100% clean energy by 2040. EPA staff in the Midwest were told to stop enforcing violations against fossil fuel companies, while the Justice Department prepared to cut two-thirds of the staff responsible for inspecting gun dealers. At the same time, the SEC dropped a civil case against Binance, the world\'92s largest crypto exchange, after it listed a Trump family token, and the administration halted or ended a dozen other crypto fraud cases, including those involving a billionaire ally. Congress responded with inquiries into Trump\'92s crypto dealings and an \'93End Crypto Corruption\'94 bill to bar federal officials from profiting from such ventures, but the immediate effect was to signal that certain financial actors were beyond reach.\
\
The symbolic landscape of power shifted as well. On June 14, Trump held a $40 million military parade in Washington, D.C., sponsored by firms like Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir, to mark his 79th birthday and the Army\'92s 250th anniversary. The parade featured tanks and troops on city streets and was poorly attended, with empty bleachers contrasting sharply with the millions marching in No Kings protests across the country. Inside the White House, the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. was removed from the Oval Office and moved out of public view, while the official portrait of Hillary Clinton was taken down from the First Ladies\'92 wall and replaced with a painting of Trump himself. At the Pentagon, Hegseth ordered a \'93passive approach\'94 to Juneteenth, instructing public affairs staff not to publish web content about the holiday. West Virginia\'92s governor canceled state Juneteenth events and ended the holiday for state workers, and major corporations like Amazon and Verizon withdrew sponsorship from Juneteenth festivals as they rolled back their own diversity programs.\
\
These symbolic acts were not isolated. They coincided with a broader campaign to reshape public memory and narrow the stories the state tells about itself. The Department of Veterans Affairs removed language barring discrimination based on political beliefs, marital status, or union activity. The administration illegally froze funds for libraries, archives, and museums, as the Government Accountability Office later found, starving institutions that preserve historical records. The Voice of America and its parent agency, USAGM, laid off or noticed layoffs for more than 1,400 staff, nearly dismantling an international broadcaster that once reached 360 million people weekly. At the same time, right-wing influencers and a sitting senator spread false claims about the Minnesota assassinations, recasting a right-leaning suspect as a \'93Marxist\'94 and blaming Democrats for the violence. The Pentagon\'92s rapid response team used official accounts to attack reporters and promote Hegseth\'92s agenda. Together, these moves shifted the information environment toward one in which state-aligned narratives thrive and independent voices are weakened or punished.\
\
The week also saw a sharp escalation in political violence and its narratives. In Minnesota, a man dressed as a police officer shot and killed state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and wounded state senator John Hoffman and his wife. He left behind a hit list of Democratic politicians and abortion-rights advocates. The FBI added him to its most wanted list, then arrested and charged him with murder, stalking, and firearms offenses. Federal and state prosecutors moved quickly, and the entire Minnesota congressional delegation issued a joint statement condemning the attack. Yet within hours, right-wing media figures and social accounts, amplified by Elon Musk and Senator Mike Lee, spread conspiracy theories that the killer was a leftist and that Democrats were to blame. The facts and the law moved in one direction. The story told to millions moved in another.\
\
Amid these pressures, civil society and parts of the state still pushed back. The No Kings protests, organized in part by the ACLU, drew about five million people to more than 2,100 events, many of them festive and patriotic, with American flags and references to the Constitution and the Revolution. Faith leaders in Los Angeles and Florida organized support networks for immigrants targeted by raids. The Los Angeles Dodgers refused ICE access to their stadium parking lots. Journalists, legal observers, and protesters filed suit against DHS and Secretary Kristi Noem, alleging excessive force and suppression of First Amendment rights. Polls showed declining support for Trump\'92s immigration policies, and the NAACP took the unprecedented step of not inviting the sitting president to its national convention. These acts did not stop the raids or the firings. They kept alive alternative centers of legitimacy and memory.\
\
Congress, too, showed flashes of institutional self-respect. Beyond the war powers resolutions and crypto bills, lawmakers questioned Defense Secretary Hegseth about the cost and effectiveness of military missions, released reports on the financial impact of Trump\'92s pardons, and sought to expand security budgets for members of Congress in the wake of the Minnesota killings. The Election Assistance Commission invited comment on a survey of election office staffing, a small but concrete step toward understanding and strengthening the machinery of voting. Yet other hearings, like a Republican-led session on Joe Biden\'92s alleged mental decline, were boycotted by most Democrats and served more as partisan theater than oversight. And when DHS rewrote the rules on detention visits, Congress had to rely on public outrage and litigation rather than its own enforcement tools.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 22, several processes were already in motion. The executive order extending the TikTok enforcement delay set a new deadline of September 17, despite a law and Supreme Court ruling that had required divestiture by January. Courts were still considering appeals on NIH grants, EPA funding, and National Guard control. War powers resolutions on Iran had been introduced but not yet voted on. The Supreme Court\'92s decision to allow challenges to California\'92s emissions waiver opened a path for future litigation that could reshape climate policy. And the administration\'92s consideration of a vastly expanded travel ban, along with visa social-media screening, signaled that the stratification of mobility and membership would likely deepen.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock still read 8:00 p.m., but the moral floor beneath it had sunk further. The executive branch had shown that it was willing to use emergency powers, immigration law, regulatory discretion, and symbolic control in ways that treated law as a weapon, not a limit. Federal power was openly targeted at disfavored states and cities. Security forces were aligned more with preserving the regime\'92s narratives than with protecting communities. Citizenship and access to the country were being sorted by wealth, ideology, and heritage. At the same time, courts blocked some of the most blatant abuses, civil society mobilized at scale, and parts of Congress tried to reclaim their constitutional roles. That is why the clock did not lurch forward. But the direction of movement remains toward normalization of lawlessness, not its reversal. Week 22 matters in the larger arc because it shows how a democracy can be hollowed out not only by singular shocks, but by the steady fusion of public power with private enrichment, partisan punishment, and curated memory, even as the forms of elections, courts, and protests continue to exist. The official time at the close of the period is 8:00 p.m., with the hands a fraction closer to night.\
