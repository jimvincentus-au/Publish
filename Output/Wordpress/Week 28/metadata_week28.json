Behind them, a small American flag is partially obscured by a stack of redacted documents and a sealed archive box stamped with a blurred government seal. A simple wall clock in the background reads 8:06 p.m. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors, conveying the fusion of law, welfare, and control.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of a sprawling detention complex on the edge of a swamp, chain-link fences and floodlights stretching into the distance, a faint outline of the Capitol and a distant city skyline on the horizon. In the foreground, a large, slightly tarnished clock reads 8:06 p.m., its glass reflecting barbed wire. Subtle hints of bureaucratic power appear as stacks of red-stamped files and shredded documents spilling from a nearby FEMA-branded truck. The mood is painterly, realistic, and somber, emphasizing institutional confinement and the quiet expansion of state power."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 28 of Trump\u2019s second term left the Democracy Clock frozen at 8:06 p.m., but the apparent stillness masked a dense consolidation of power. The administration fused emergency authorities, immigration law, and FEMA money into a domestic archipelago of camps, from Alligator Alcatraz\u2019s legal black hole to abusive private facilities and a new grant pipeline for detention infrastructure. An executive order targeting homeless people, Alien Enemies Act deportations without hearings, and pressure on DACA recipients to \u201cself-deport\u201d extended confinement logic beyond the border. Vice President Vance\u2019s ancestry-based citizenship rhetoric, SNAP and Medicaid cuts, and targeted attacks on trans healthcare and reproductive rights hardened a hierarchy of belonging. AI-driven deregulation, loyalist judicial and prosecutorial appointments, and politicized data at BLS and FBI hollowed out institutional checks. Universities and media were disciplined through funding threats, merger conditions, and licensing intimidation, while archives and statistics were curated to protect the president. Courts, states, and investigative journalists mounted scattered resistance, but the moral floor continued to sag.",
