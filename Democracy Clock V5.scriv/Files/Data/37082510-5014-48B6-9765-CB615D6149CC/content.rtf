In Week 15, the story of Trump\'92s second term turned more plainly into a story about rule by decree. The surface events were varied\'97tariffs and pardons, curriculum fights and deportation cases, climate rollbacks and club openings\'97but they shared a single pattern. Power moved inward, toward the presidency and its allies, and outward, away from neutral institutions and shared facts. The week\'92s core theme was not a single scandal or law. It was the steady conversion of government into an instrument of loyalty, profit, and narrative control.\
\
At the close of the previous period, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:50 p.m. It now reads 7:51 p.m., a shift of 0.7 minutes. The movement is small in appearance, but it reflects a dense cluster of structural changes. Executive power without effective oversight ticked upward as emergency authorities and sweeping orders reached deeper into trade, immigration, education, and the civil service. Law as a weapon, not a limit, advanced as the Department of Justice was turned against political opponents and away from corporate and financial crime. Agencies were hollowed and captured, independent media were starved while state-aligned outlets grew, and citizenship itself was further stratified by origin and identity. Courts, states, and civil society did push back in key cases, but the net effect was a week in which it became harder for law, information, and public service to stand between the ruler and his will.\
\
The most visible engine of this shift was the presidency\'92s use of emergency powers and executive orders to bypass Congress and independent regulators. On trade, Trump leaned on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, framing it as a national emergency, and closed the \'93de minimis\'94 loophole that had allowed low\uc0\u8209 value imports to enter duty\u8209 free. These moves re-centered tariff policy in the Oval Office, with ports projecting shipping volumes down by more than a third and UPS announcing 20,000 layoffs and 73 facility closures. Economic pain spread through logistics, manufacturing, and housing. Yet the White House insisted that any downturn was the previous administration\'92s fault and promised a coming boom. When the Senate and House had chances to vote on ending the tariff emergency, Republican leaders blocked those votes. The emergency structure stayed in place, and Congress confirmed that it would not, for now, reclaim its trade authority.\
\
Immigration and security policy saw the same pattern of emergency logic. Trump declared a national border emergency, paving the way for troop deployments and hardline enforcement, and used the Alien Enemies Act\'97an 18th\uc0\u8209 century wartime statute\'97to detain and expel Venezuelan migrants labeled as gang members or foreign threats. Migrants were charged for entering a newly created military buffer zone along the border, a 170\u8209 mile strip patrolled by active\u8209 duty troops, blurring the line between military and civilian policing. In parallel, an executive order threatened to strip federal funds from \'93sanctuary\'94 jurisdictions and ordered public shaming lists of noncompliant cities and states. These actions did not simply enforce existing law; they redefined whole categories of people and places as security problems subject to exceptional treatment, with courts scrambling to draw lines. A federal judge in Texas ultimately ruled that the Alien Enemies Act could not be used this way and permanently barred such deportations in his district, and the Supreme Court intervened to halt at least one individual removal. But the message from the executive was clear. Emergency tools were now routine instruments of domestic policy.\
\
Alongside this expansion of decree power came a sharp repurposing of law enforcement and the Justice Department. The civil rights division lost about 70% of its attorneys through departures and reassignments, as its mission was redirected toward voter fraud investigations and limiting transgender rights. The voting section\'92s entire management was removed, and lawyers were told to dismiss active cases, hollowing out federal enforcement of voting\uc0\u8209 rights laws. At the same time, the administration ordered the DOJ to investigate ActBlue, the Democratic Party\'92s main online fundraising platform, after Trump publicly called it an \'93illegal scam.\'94 An earlier executive order targeted pro bono immigration lawyers, accusing them of coaching clients to lie and directing the Attorney General to seek sanctions. These moves turned prosecutorial discretion into a partisan weapon, aimed at opposition fundraising, legal advocacy, and the machinery that protects ballot access.\
\
The other side of this weaponization was impunity for allies and donors. Trump pardoned Michele Fiore, a former Las Vegas official convicted of fraud, and, as a former DOJ pardon attorney testified, issued clemency that erased over $1 billion in debts and fines owed by white\uc0\u8209 collar offenders and a cryptocurrency exchange. The Justice Department dropped investigations and lawsuits against 89 corporations, many tied to Trump\'92s inaugural fund. In April it abruptly closed its cryptocurrency enforcement unit after criticism from crypto leaders close to the president, and then paused prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for six months. Together, these decisions signaled that elite financial crime would be handled with leniency or not at all, while law would fall hardest on migrants, protesters, and political adversaries. Courts did not fully endorse this pattern\'97one judge pressed DOJ on retaliatory contracting in a case involving a major law firm\'97but the structural tilt was unmistakable.\
\
Beneath these headline fights, the civil service and scientific bureaucracy absorbed some of the week\'92s deepest blows. Elon Musk\'92s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continued its ideological purge, cutting 60% of the staff at the Department of Energy\'92s Loan Programs Office and driving researchers out of federal science agencies. The administration halted disbursement of bipartisan infrastructure funds, many tied to green energy, and installed a young DOGE operative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to use AI tools to rewrite regulations. Another emergency appeal asked the Supreme Court to let DOGE access sensitive Social Security records, even after an appeals court had blocked such access. In parallel, Trump signed an order reclassifying tens of thousands of civil service roles as political appointments, clearing the way to replace career officials with loyalists. The Peace Corps launched a deferred resignation program under DOGE pressure, and the National Park Service prepared a large \'93reduction in force\'94 that could cut thousands of jobs. These were not isolated staffing decisions. They were the construction of a parallel, lightly accountable apparatus inside the state, where AI systems and political operatives could reshape rules and programs without the friction of independent expertise.\
\
Environmental and climate institutions were targeted with equal force. The administration dismissed nearly 400 contributors to the National Climate Assessment, canceled contracts, and pulled climate datasets from public access, weakening the country\'92s ability to plan for heat, storms, and drought. Over 140 environmental regulations were rolled back or rewritten in the first 100 days of the term, from vehicle and power\uc0\u8209 plant standards to public\u8209 lands protections and Endangered Species Act rules. New executive orders eased fossil fuel extraction, granted tariff exemptions to parts of the oil and gas industry, and halted approvals of solar and wind projects on federal lands and waters. Tariffs on imported solar components from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia, combined with permitting freezes, led to the cancellation or downsizing of billions in clean\u8209 energy investments. At the same time, the Justice Department sued New York and Vermont to block their climate superfund laws, and later sued Michigan and Hawaii to stop climate litigation against oil companies, arguing that the Clean Air Act preempted such efforts. Puerto Rico, facing this federal pressure, dropped its own climate lawsuit. In this domain, the state\'92s role as steward of shared resources was inverted. Agencies and courts were steered to protect incumbent fossil interests and to erase the legal and scientific groundwork for climate accountability.\
\
Information and media were not left untouched. Attorney General Pam Bondi rescinded DOJ policies that had shielded journalists from subpoenas in leak cases, allowing prosecutors to compel reporters to reveal confidential sources and jail them for contempt. The White House barred the Associated Press from the Oval Office and the presidential pool, while legal threats extracted a $15 million payment from ABC and lawsuits targeted CBS and the Des Moines Register. Trump signed an executive order cutting off federal funding for NPR and PBS through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, accusing them of bias, and a Project 2025\'96aligned FCC opened investigations that could further defund public media. At the same time, the administration launched White House Wire, a news\uc0\u8209 style website on official servers that aggregated favorable coverage, press releases, and social media posts, while hosting alternative briefings for ideologically aligned outlets. The result was a dual strategy: starve independent media of resources and access, and build a state\u8209 aligned channel to carry the regime\'92s narrative directly to supporters.\
\
The fight over information extended into schools, universities, and memory institutions. The administration threatened to withhold funds from universities over pro\uc0\u8209 Palestinian protests and race\u8209 based support programs, listing campuses as at risk for \'93antisemitic harassment\'94 and opening investigations into Harvard and Chicago\'92s Black Student Success Plan. Swarthmore suspended student protesters without full process, and ICE raids and deportations targeted communities linked to campus activism. In Oklahoma, the state board of education, under Superintendent Ryan Walters, approved a 400\u8209 page social studies curriculum that had been sent to members only hours before the vote. The standards inserted pro\u8209 Trump conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, required students to analyze debunked fraud claims, elevated Christianity and the Bible throughout the grades, and downplayed Joe Biden\'92s presidency and the principle of church\u8209 state separation. Walters claimed the changes reflected public input, though no evidence supported this. At the federal level, Trump signed orders to dismantle the Department of Education and to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across government. He also fired Doug Emhoff and other Biden appointees from the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Together, these moves tightened political control over what is taught and remembered, from elementary classrooms to national museums.\
\
Citizenship and belonging were narrowed in law and practice. Trump signed an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for many US\uc0\u8209 born children of undocumented and some legal immigrants, directly challenging the Fourteenth Amendment; a federal judge quickly blocked it as \'93blatantly unconstitutional,\'94 but the order\'92s existence signaled a new hierarchy of membership. Refugee admissions were suspended, with only case\u8209 by\u8209 case exceptions in the \'93national interest,\'94 and the administration missed a key deadline for reporting on restarting the program. Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans became the subject of a Supreme Court appeal, as the administration sought to revoke it despite lower\u8209 court orders. ICE deported US\u8209 citizen children, including a four\u8209 year\u8209 old with cancer, without medication or proper consultation, and deported mothers and their citizen children to Honduras after routine check\u8209 ins, often without allowing them to arrange custody. ICE and DHS coordinated with the Postal Inspection Service to use mail images and account data to locate suspected undocumented immigrants, and conducted raids that mistakenly targeted citizen families, seizing phones and savings. A new military buffer zone at the border became a site of criminal prosecutions. In each case, the law\'92s protective shell around certain people\'97citizens, children, the sick, asylum seekers\'97thinned, while the machinery of enforcement grew more opaque and more willing to ignore court orders.\
\
Civil rights for marginalized groups were rolled back on multiple fronts. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs were terminated across the federal government, and a federal judge allowed the administration to move forward with terminating grants related to DEI and environmental justice. The Pentagon\'92s Women, Peace and Security program was shut down, and the Department of Defense\'92s gender\uc0\u8209 focused initiatives were pared back to the legal minimum. Trump signed an order banning gender transitions for people under 19 and directing federal insurance programs to exclude coverage, while HHS released a lengthy report urging therapy over medical treatment for youth with gender dysphoria, in defiance of major medical associations. The USDA had earlier tried to freeze child nutrition funds for Maine over its trans athlete policies, and only a settlement restored those funds after the state sued. Environmental justice offices and grants were closed, with their goals conflated with DEI \'93wokeness.\'94 These actions did not only change policy. They redefined which lives and identities the federal government would actively protect, and which it would treat as expendable or suspect.\
\
Against this backdrop, crony capitalism and monetized access became more explicit. The \'93Executive Branch\'94 club opened in Georgetown, charging more than half a million dollars for membership and promising private conversations with Trump advisers and cabinet members. The $TRUMP cryptocurrency contest offered dinners, receptions, and VIP White House tours to the top token holders, with Trump and his companies profiting from transaction fees and rising coin values. Senators called for an ethics inquiry, warning that foreign governments and contractors under investigation could buy influence without disclosure. At the same time, the administration dropped corporate cases, paused FCPA enforcement, and closed the crypto unit. Policy outcomes\'97from tariff exemptions for fossil fuels to bailouts for tariff\uc0\u8209 hit farmers\'97tracked the interests of well\u8209 placed industries and donors. The line between public office and private gain, already thin, grew more indistinct.\
\
Yet the week was not a one\uc0\u8209 way slide. Courts and some state actors continued to resist. Judges ordered the restoration of funds to Radio Free Europe and blocked mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A federal judge in Vermont ordered the release of a Palestinian student, Mohsen Mahdawi, from immigration detention, noting that his continued confinement would chill protected speech. Another judge temporarily blocked DHS from transferring migrants to other agencies to avoid due process, and a Trump\u8209 appointed judge in Texas permanently barred the use of the Alien Enemies Act for Venezuelan deportations in his district. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, speaking in Puerto Rico, warned that threats and harassment of judges were attacks on democracy itself. Harvard refused to bend its governance and admissions to federal demands in exchange for funding. Senators demanded a report on wrongful deportations to El Salvador, and state attorneys general pressed climate cases until DOJ sued to stop them. Civil society mobilized: millions had marched earlier in the month in \'93Hands Off!\'94 protests, and Democratic leaders held sit\u8209 ins and speeches against budget cuts and the administration\'92s first hundred days.\
\
Looking ahead from this week, several processes were already in motion. The Supreme Court had been asked to weigh in on TPS revocation for Venezuelans and on DOGE\'92s access to Social Security records. The Senate Finance Committee was preparing to consider Rodney Scott\'92s nomination to lead Customs and Border Protection despite allegations of a cover\uc0\u8209 up in a fatal case. The FCC and DOJ investigations into NPR, PBS, and public broadcasters were underway, as were Oklahoma\'92s curriculum changes for the coming school year. The Religious Liberty Commission had been created and would begin advising the White House Faith Office. The Peace Corps\'92 deferred resignation program and National Park Service reductions were scheduled to unfold over the coming months. None of these were speculative; they were already on the calendar, and their outcomes would shape how far the patterns of Week 15 could harden into the new normal.\
\
By the end of the week, the Democracy Clock\'92s movement to 7:51 p.m. captured more than a list of orders and lawsuits. It marked a tightening of the circle around power: a presidency more willing to act alone, a justice system more bent toward friends and against foes, agencies more hollowed and more captured, media more pressured and more replaced, citizenship more stratified, and civic education more rewritten. The moral floor of the republic\'97character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, stewardship\'97showed visible cracks. Pardons for fraudsters and January 6 defendants, the targeting of lawyers and journalists, the erasure of climate science and DEI, and the monetization of access all pointed to a leadership comfortable with using public tools for private and partisan ends. At the same time, the week showed that resistance still exists: in courtrooms, in statehouses, on campuses, and in the streets. The significance of Week 15 lies in this tension. The structures that once made abuse of power difficult are being reshaped to make it easy, even as some actors still try to hold the line. The official time at the close of the period is 7:51 p.m., and the hour is later not because democracy has fallen, but because the work required to keep it standing has grown heavier, more urgent, and more unevenly shared.\
