\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 25 Appendix: Immigration Raids as Governance\
\
This week reflects an acute phase of authoritarian consolidation centered on executive overreach, weaponized law, and the hollowing out of the professional state. The Supreme Court\'92s immunity ruling and its greenlighting of mass federal layoffs, combined with Trump\'92s unilateral use of emergency powers for tariffs, war-making, and immigration crackdowns, sharply weaken checks on the presidency (Traits 1, 4, 5, 13, 14). Simultaneously, large-scale purges and politicization of the civil service\'97at State, DHS, NWS, FEMA, NASA, and health agencies\'97erode neutral administration and capacity, especially in diplomacy, public health, and disaster response (Traits 16, 22, 35). Immigration and citizenship policy are used as tools of ideological and ethnic stratification, from TPS terminations and third-country deportations to the attempted end of birthright citizenship, partially checked by lower courts (Traits 4, 45, 47). Militarized immigration raids, National Guard deployments, and aggressive ICE tactics normalize state violence against immigrants and protesters (Traits 8, 9, 41, 50). Parallel information operations\'97attacks on media, science, and truth around floods, vaccines, and unpopular economic policies\'97reinforce a chaotic environment that blurs accountability (Traits 21, 52, 53, 60).\

Week 25 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump blocked over $6 billion in congressionally approved education funds (2025-07-06): By refusing to release billions for after-school and summer programs that Congress had appropriated, the president undercut legislative control of the purse and signaled a willingness to use impoundment to reshape domestic policy unilaterally.\
\
2. President Trump fired NSA Director Timothy Haugh and his deputy after receiving a loyalty list from an outside influencer (2025-07-06): Removing senior intelligence leaders based on a partisan influencer\'92s list blurred lines between national security and personal loyalty, weakening professional control over surveillance powers and concentrating authority in the president\'92s inner circle.\
\
3. President Trump fired six National Security Council staffers deemed disloyal by an outside activist (2025-07-06): Purging National Security Council staff on ideological grounds empowered unelected allies to shape security staffing and discouraged independent analysis inside the executive, eroding neutral expertise in high-stakes decision-making.\
\
4. President Trump pardoned supporters involved in the January 6 Capitol attack (2025-07-06): Granting clemency to people who attacked Congress signaled tolerance for political violence on the president\'92s behalf and weakened deterrence against future assaults on electoral certification and peaceful transfer of power.\
\
5. President Trump and congressional Republicans enacted a sweeping budget reconciliation law reshaping taxes, social programs, and immigration enforcement (2025-07-05): The new law locked in large tax cuts for the wealthy, slashed Medicaid and SNAP, and massively expanded border wall and ICE funding, redistributing state power and resources away from social protection toward enforcement.\
\
6. President Trump ordered the Department of Justice to target political opponents and critics (2025-07-06): Directing DOJ to scrutinize and punish rivals, including by threatening their security details, subordinated prosecutorial decisions to personal vendettas and weakened the norm of politically neutral law enforcement.\
\
7. President Trump used a national emergency declaration to impose tariffs without Congress (2025-07-06): Invoking emergency powers to set trade barriers bypassed normal legislative processes and normalized using crisis authorities for routine economic policy, expanding unilateral presidential control over trade.\
\
8. President Trump ordered a military strike on Iran without seeking congressional authorization (2025-07-06): Launching a strike on Iran without Congress\'92s approval sidestepped the constitutional war power, reinforcing a pattern of presidents treating major uses of force as executive prerogatives rather than shared decisions.\
\
9. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all members of a key CDC vaccine advisory panel and installed vaccine skeptics (2025-07-07): Removing established vaccine advisers and replacing them with skeptics politicized a core scientific body, giving executive appointees greater control over immunization policy that affects public health and insurance coverage.\
\
10. Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for Honduran and Nicaraguan immigrants (2025-07-07): Ending long-standing TPS for tens of thousands of Central Americans stripped lawful status from residents integrated into U.S. communities, using executive discretion over humanitarian relief to reorder who is secure under immigration law.\
\
11. Federal Emergency Management Agency leadership restricted staff communications with Congress and local officials during disaster response (2025-07-07): Limiting FEMA personnel\'92s ability to coordinate and share information with other governments during emergencies centralized control within political appointees and reduced external oversight of life\uc0\u8209 saving operations.\
\
12. Trump administration delayed enforcement of a TikTok ban law for 75 days by directive (2025-07-07): Instructing DOJ not to enforce a duly enacted TikTok ban for a set period showed the executive branch selectively choosing which laws to apply, weakening the expectation that statutes bind the presidency.\
\
13. President Trump issued an executive order ending subsidies and tax credits for wind and solar energy (2025-07-07): Eliminating federal support for renewables by executive order shifted energy policy toward fossil and other favored sources without new legislation, concentrating climate\uc0\u8209 relevant economic choices in the presidency.\
\
14. President Trump extended a suspension of certain reciprocal tariffs until August 1, 2025 (2025-07-07): By unilaterally extending a tariff pause and signaling the date was flexible, the president underscored how trade partners and domestic firms must navigate shifting economic rules set from the White House rather than Congress.\
\
15. President Trump limited classified information shared with Congress (2025-07-06): Curtailing lawmakers\'92 access to classified material weakened Congress\'92s ability to oversee foreign policy and security programs, tilting the balance of power toward the executive on critical national decisions.\
\
16. President Trump took control of California\'92s National Guard to suppress mostly peaceful immigration protests (2025-07-06): Federalizing and deploying a state\'92s Guard over the governor\'92s objections to police protests blurred civil\uc0\u8209 military boundaries and used military force to manage domestic dissent and state policy disputes.\
\
17. President Trump expanded the definition of presidential control over foreign affairs via executive order (2025-02-12): Asserting that foreign policy authority rests solely in the presidency narrowed space for congressional and judicial checks on international decisions, strengthening a unitary executive view of external relations.\
\
18. President Trump suggested a federal takeover of New York City if voters elect a disfavored mayoral candidate (2025-07-08): Threatening to seize control of a city\'92s government based on its electoral choices signaled willingness to override local self\uc0\u8209 rule for partisan ends, undermining confidence that municipal elections determine governance.\
\
19. President Trump publicly mused about states deciding whether to restrict access to birth control (2024-01-01): Floating the idea that states could curtail contraception access, even if later walked back, signaled openness to devolving core bodily autonomy rights to majoritarian state politics rather than federal protection.\
\
20. President Trump launched an effort to undermine birthright citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment (2025-07-10): Challenging automatic citizenship for U.S.-born children of undocumented parents used executive power to contest a foundational constitutional rule defining membership in the political community.\
\
21. President Trump signed an executive order promoting AI use in education without educator input (2025-04-30): Mandating AI integration in classrooms through executive order, in coordination with tech firms, shifted control over educational tools and priorities toward the White House and corporate partners rather than local educators and legislatures.\
\
22. White House recruited 68 technology companies to support its AI education agenda (2025-07-09): Enlisting major tech firms to fund and design AI curricula under a presidential pledge deepened executive\uc0\u8209 corporate collaboration in shaping how students learn, with limited democratic oversight of data use and content.\
\
23. President Trump announced plans to lay off about 15% of State Department domestic staff (2025-07-10): Ordering large\uc0\u8209 scale State Department layoffs as part of an \'93America First\'94 restructuring concentrated foreign\u8209 policy discretion in fewer, more politically aligned hands and reduced institutional capacity for independent diplomacy.\
\
24. President Trump directed the State Department to issue over 1,300 termination notices in rolling reductions in force (2025-07-11): Implementing rolling RIFs at State following court clearance operationalized the administration\'92s plan to shrink and reshape the diplomatic corps, reinforcing executive control over who represents the U.S. abroad.\
\
25. President Trump publicly attacked Democrats who opposed his budget bill, saying he hated them (2025-07-06): Declaring hatred for legislators who voted against his signature bill personalized political conflict and further normalized dehumanizing rhetoric toward institutional opposition.\
\
26. President Trump claimed an unpopular budget law was the most popular bill ever signed (2025-07-06): Insisting that polling\uc0\u8209 disfavored legislation was overwhelmingly popular exemplified the executive\'92s use of false claims to frame major policy shifts, complicating informed public judgment of government actions.\
\
27. President Trump suggested states should decide on access to birth control (2024-01-01): Signaling support for state\uc0\u8209 level control over contraception access, even briefly, indicated willingness to let fundamental reproductive decisions depend on local political majorities rather than uniform rights.\
\
\
Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed HB 1143 banning oil drilling near national estuarine reserves in rural counties (2025-07-05): The new Florida law restricted oil activity near sensitive estuarine reserves, showing a state legislature and governor using statutory tools to protect local ecosystems and associated economies.\
\
2. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a bill to criminalize weather modification practices (2025-07-05): Proposing felony penalties for weather modification based on conspiracy narratives illustrated how legislative agendas can be steered by misinformation, diverting institutional attention from evidence\uc0\u8209 based climate policy.\
\
3. Republican-controlled Congress passed President Trump\'92s large domestic policy bill affecting the social safety net (2025-07-06): Approving a partisan bill expected to dismantle parts of the safety net and raise deficits showed a legislature prioritizing ideological goals over broad public support, with lasting effects on fiscal capacity and social equity.\
\
4. Alaska Native Village Municipal Lands Restoration Act of 2025 restored municipal lands to Alaska Native villages (2025-07-07): The new federal law returned municipal lands to Alaska Native villages, strengthening local self\uc0\u8209 governance and clarifying land management authority for Indigenous communities.\
\
5. California Governor Gavin Newsom and state legislature enacted CEQA streamlining bills AB 130 and AB 131 to speed housing approvals (2025-07-07): By easing environmental review for infill and certain projects, California adjusted procedural rules to accelerate housing and manufacturing, trading some review layers for faster permitting in response to affordability pressures.\
\
6. Supreme Court of the United States limited the use of nationwide injunctions against federal policies (2025-07-06): Curtailing lower courts\'92 ability to issue nationwide injunctions reduced a key tool for quickly halting contested executive actions, making it harder for single cases to protect people outside the filing jurisdiction.\
\
7. Gun Owners of America and allied groups filed a lawsuit arguing the National Firearms Act is now unconstitutional (2025-07-06): Challenging the 1934 National Firearms Act on the basis of new tax and registration changes sought to use recent legislation to weaken long\uc0\u8209 standing federal gun controls through the courts.\
\
8.

\
9. U.S. Department of Justice began handing over sensitive audio tapes in the Kiki Camarena murder case to defense counsel (2025-07-06): Providing long\uc0\u8209 withheld recordings in a major cartel prosecution reflected judicially supervised disclosure obligations that can illuminate past abuses and strengthen due process in transnational crime cases.\
\
10. Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration over a law cutting Medicaid funding to its clinics (2025-07-07): The lawsuit challenged a federal attempt to strip Medicaid reimbursements from Planned Parenthood, testing whether Congress and the executive can target specific providers in ways that restrict access to reproductive health care.\
\
11. Federal court temporarily blocked the Planned Parenthood defunding provision in Trump\'92s bill (2025-07-07): Issuing an injunction against a Medicaid defunding clause preserved access to Planned Parenthood services while courts assess the law\'92s constitutionality, illustrating judicial checks on targeted funding restrictions.\

\
14. Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts (2025-07-08): Granting absolute and presumptive immunity for many presidential acts raised the bar for holding former presidents criminally accountable, shifting the balance between executive power and legal constraint.\
\
15.

\
16. Supreme Court of the United States upheld a block on Florida\'92s law criminalizing undocumented immigrants entering the state (2025-07-09): Refusing to let Florida enforce SB 4\uc0\u8209 C affirmed federal primacy over immigration and prevented a state from independently criminalizing presence, protecting migrants from an aggressive state statute.\
\
17. American Academy of Pediatrics and allied medical groups sued HHS and RFK Jr. over vaccine policy and advisory panel changes (2025-07-09): Medical organizations turned to the courts to contest HHS\'92s restructuring of vaccine oversight and COVID\uc0\u8209 19 vaccine availability, arguing the agency violated administrative law and endangered public health.\
\
18. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sued California over policies allowing transgender girls to compete in school sports (2025-07-09): By framing California\'92s inclusive sports rules as Title IX violations, DOJ used federal civil\uc0\u8209 rights enforcement tools to challenge state protections for transgender students, reshaping the meaning of sex discrimination.\

\
24. Justice Samuel Alito criticized the Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage decision (2022-01-01): Alito\'92s continued attacks on Obergefell underscored that federal marriage equality remains contested within the Court, keeping the status of LGBTQ+ rights vulnerable to future doctrinal shifts.\

\
26. President Trump nominated Emil Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (2025-07-11): Elevating a loyal DOJ prosecutor accused in a whistleblower complaint of urging defiance of court orders raised concerns that appellate benches are being filled with figures aligned to executive interests.\

\
33. U.S. Supreme Court (historical) issued the Dred Scott decision denying Black people citizenship and limiting federal power (1857-01-01): Dred Scott entrenched a vision of state\uc0\u8209 centered democracy that excluded Black Americans from citizenship, illustrating how judicial doctrine can entrench anti\u8209 democratic hierarchies until overturned.\

\
36.

37. Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter accusing Uni\'f3n del Barrio of aiding criminal conduct related to immigration protests (2025-06-01): The senator\'92s accusation against a community group monitoring ICE operations illustrated how elected officials can use oversight rhetoric to delegitimize civil\uc0\u8209 society actors that document enforcement abuses.\

\
\
Economic Structure\
\
1. Trump administration prepared to let a 90-day pause on steep tariffs expire, risking sharp increases on many countries (2025-07-05): Allowing high tariffs to snap back after a brief pause threatened to raise costs for U.S. firms and consumers and injected uncertainty into global trade relationships.\
\
2. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended Medicaid cuts and downplayed tariff impacts on the economy (2025-07-05): Framing deep social\uc0\u8209 program cuts as personal responsibility and minimizing tariff risks signaled a policy preference for austerity and trade confrontation over broad\u8209 based economic security.\
\
3. Republican Congress and President Trump made 2017 tax cuts permanent while cutting Medicaid and SNAP and boosting ICE and wall funding (2025-07-05): Locking in regressive tax cuts and shrinking safety\uc0\u8209 net programs while expanding enforcement budgets reoriented federal spending toward capital and coercion rather than social protection.\
\
4. Congress allocated $170.7 billion for immigration enforcement, including a 265% increase in ICE detention funding (2025-07-06): The unprecedented enforcement budget made ICE the largest federal law\uc0\u8209 enforcement agency, channeling public funds into detention and deportation infrastructure instead of alternative public goods.\
\
5. Environmental Protection Agency approved multiple state air quality implementation plans and related revisions (2025-07-07): EPA approvals for SIP revisions in Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Missouri, Evangeline Parish, and Ohio regional haze, plus landfill and haze rules, maintained cooperative federalism structures for air regulation.\
\
6.

\
8. Federal Communications Commission sought public comment on several telecommunications information collections (2025-07-07): Inviting feedback on licensing and transfer\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 control paperwork under the Paperwork Reduction Act aimed to balance regulatory oversight with administrative burdens on telecom providers.\
\
9. DTE Energy and allied dark-money networks were reported to have funded efforts to undermine Michigan\'92s COVID-19 public health policies (2025-07-07): Revelations that a utility helped bankroll campaigns against state pandemic measures highlighted how corporate money can covertly shape health policy and regulatory outcomes.\
\
10. Trump administration delayed implementation of new tariffs until August 1, 2025 (2025-07-07): Pushing back tariff start dates while keeping high rates on the table prolonged uncertainty for importers and trading partners, using timing shifts as leverage in negotiations.\
\
11. President Trump announced detailed new tariff rates on numerous countries effective August 1 (2025-07-07): Setting steep, country\uc0\u8209 specific tariffs on a wide range of nations reconfigured trade incentives and risked retaliatory measures, with downstream effects on prices and supply chains.\
\
12. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted vitamins and supplements as measles treatments and sought CDC guidance changes (2025-07-07): Advocating unproven measles treatments and pressing CDC to endorse them risked diverting patients from effective vaccines, with economic implications for health systems and families.\

\
15. Pentagon and Trump administration advanced a budget pushing annual U.S. military spending above $1 trillion with large contractor payouts (2025-07-08): The new defense budget funneled more than half of Pentagon discretionary spending to private firms, deepening reliance on contractors and crowding out non\uc0\u8209 military public investments.\
\
16. Trump administration cut $150 million from NOAA and slashed the National Science Foundation budget by 56% (2025-07-08): Severe reductions in weather and basic science funding weakened the research base for climate resilience and innovation, privileging short\uc0\u8209 term savings over long\u8209 term public knowledge infrastructure.\
\
17. Trump administration considered issuing work visas to migrant farm workers while avoiding broad amnesty (2025-07-08): Exploring limited work visas to stabilize food supply while maintaining a hard line on status reflected a willingness to use precarious labor arrangements to meet economic needs without expanding rights.\

\
22. Occupational Safety and Health Administration extended OMB approval for several workplace safety information collections and testing programs (2025-07-09): Renewing data collection for hexavalent chromium, walking\uc0\u8209 working surfaces, and the Alliance Program, and expanding a testing lab\'92s recognition, maintained regulatory oversight while adjusting burdens on employers.\
\
23. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention submitted information collection requests to monitor emergency response and injury prevention programs (2025-07-10): Seeking OMB approval for new emergency data elements and injury\uc0\u8209 prevention monitoring aimed to improve how public\u8209 health programs are evaluated and coordinated across jurisdictions.\
\
24.

\
25. U.S. Census Bureau requested comments on extending the Special Census Program (2025-07-11): Continuing the option for localities to commission special censuses affects how population data\'97and thus funding and representation\'97can be updated between decennial counts.\

\
31. Argentina President Javier Milei implemented sweeping deregulation, privatization, and labor law changes via executive measures (2025-07-10): Milei\'92s reforms eased hiring and firing, weakened unions, and moved to privatize state firms, rapidly shifting Argentina\'92s economic model toward market liberalization with major implications for workers\'92 bargaining power.\
