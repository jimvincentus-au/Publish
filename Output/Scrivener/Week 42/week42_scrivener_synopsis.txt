In Week 42 of Trump’s second term, the Democracy Clock’s hands stayed fixed at 8:11 p.m., but the machinery behind them strained. The White House openly defied court orders to pay full SNAP benefits during a prolonged shutdown, turning hunger and federal payrolls into bargaining chips while Congress repeatedly failed to reopen government. Judges ordered compliance, yet the administration appealed, treating rulings as negotiable. Simultaneously, the Justice Department narrowed the War Powers Resolution, Trump mused about using the Insurrection Act beyond judicial review, and Congress declined to constrain potential strikes in Venezuela. Immigration enforcement hardened into a quasi-military, partly privatized regime of raids, expanded detention, and data-driven tracking of children. A major tax cut for the wealthy, secret health-care donations funding a $300 million White House ballroom, and elite-friendly pardons fused public policy with private gain. Courts and voters mounted pockets of resistance, but executive impunity, stratified citizenship, and curated memory advanced another step.
