\f0\fs26 \cf0 **Character**  \
This week, the character of public officials was notably compromised as executive actions increasingly prioritized personal and political interests over public duty. The mass pardons granted to individuals involved in the January 6 insurrection exemplified a troubling disregard for accountability, while the dismissal of inspectors general across various departments further illustrated a willingness to weaponize office for personal gain. The actions of these leaders reflected a significant erosion of civic decency, as they chose to align their decisions with short-term political advantages rather than the principles of integrity and service to the public. While there were judicial challenges to these actions, they were overshadowed by the dominant narrative of executive overreach, indicating a troubling trend where character is increasingly subordinated to power.\
\
**Ethics**  \
The ethical boundaries between public power and private interest were severely blurred this week, as the launch of personal cryptocurrencies and the promotion of family-branded assets raised significant conflict-of-interest concerns. Such actions not only reflected a blatant disregard for ethical standards but also highlighted a systemic failure of oversight mechanisms that should protect against self-dealing. The limited pushback from regulatory bodies indicated a troubling normalization of these practices, suggesting that the intertwining of personal enrichment with public office is becoming increasingly accepted. This erosion of ethical conduct poses a significant risk to the integrity of democratic governance, as it undermines the foundational principle that public officials should serve the public interest above their own.\
\
**Restraint**  \
The week was marked by a conspicuous lack of restraint among those in power, as emergency powers were invoked to bypass normal legislative processes. This aggressive use of authority signaled a troubling departure from the principles of self-limitation and respect for democratic norms. Legislative bodies, rather than acting as a check on executive power, appeared complicit in advancing measures that aligned with the executive's priorities. The absence of restraint in the exercise of power not only undermines the legitimacy of governance but also sets a dangerous precedent for future actions, as it diminishes the expectation that leaders will act within the bounds of established norms.\
\
**Truthfulness**  \
Truthfulness suffered a significant blow this week, as repeated false claims regarding military actions, crime rates, and foreign aid spending eroded public trust. The executive's narrative control persisted despite attempts by media and civil society to correct misinformation. This manipulation of facts not only distorts public understanding but also fosters an environment where citizens are governed by manufactured realities. The failure to uphold the obligation to speak accurately on matters of public consequence reflects a broader trend of disinformation that undermines the foundation of informed democratic participation.\
\
**Good Faith**  \
The spirit of good faith was undermined as executive orders actively worked to dismantle established legal frameworks concerning citizenship and asylum. This disregard for the intent of the law indicated a willingness to manipulate democratic processes for political gain. While judicial interventions temporarily halted some of these actions, the overall trend suggested a systematic effort to circumvent the principles that uphold democratic integrity. The manipulation of legal norms not only threatens the rule of law but also erodes public confidence in the fairness of democratic institutions.\
\
**Stewardship**  \
Stewardship of institutions was severely compromised this week, as the dismantling of federal oversight mechanisms and the politicization of civil service roles weakened institutional integrity. The aggressive purging of inspectors general and the introduction of loyalty tests for civil servants indicated a troubling trend toward undermining the capacity of institutions to serve the public effectively. While civil society organizations mobilized to challenge these actions, the overall trajectory reflected a significant erosion of institutional credibility and trust. This neglect of stewardship responsibilities poses a long-term threat to the health of democratic governance, as it undermines the very structures designed to protect public interests.\

**Moral Floor Judgment \'96 Week 2**  \
The moral floor continued to deteriorate this week, marked by a significant escalation in the erosion of democratic norms and ethical boundaries. The aggressive executive actions, including mass pardons and the dismantling of oversight mechanisms, exemplified a troubling trend toward authoritarian governance. While there were instances of judicial resistance and civil society mobilization, these efforts were overshadowed by the consolidation of power and the normalization of practices that blur the lines between public service and personal rule. The trajectory indicates a high risk of further erosion of democratic integrity, as the intertwining of personal interests with public office becomes increasingly accepted. The cumulative condition reflects a concerning shift that threatens the foundations of democracy, leaving the moral floor precariously low.}
