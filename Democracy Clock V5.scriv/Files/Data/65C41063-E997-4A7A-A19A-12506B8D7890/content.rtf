\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 12 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, fused with a hard-right project to reorder law, economy, and memory. The White House used executive orders and emergency trade powers to bypass Congress, weaponized immigration and DOJ against critics, and directly targeted law firms, universities, and NGOs. Immigration enforcement shifted further toward mass, often lawless, deportation, with the Alien Enemies Act normalized and data-sharing between IRS and DHS institutionalized. Simultaneously, sweeping tariffs and chaotic reversals destabilized markets while enriching insiders and entrenching crony capitalism. Civil service and scientific capacity were gutted\'97NOAA climate staff, Social Security, FDA, and research funding\'97while coal and fossil interests were elevated and state climate laws preempted. On the information front, DEI and civil-rights narratives were scrubbed from federal content and state databases, and universities faced funding freezes and looming consent decrees over protest. Yet courts, some in Congress, and mass protest mounted real resistance: judges restored AP access, ordered Abrego Garcia\'92s return, blocked some funding freezes, and legislators advanced bills to claw back tariff and conflict-of-interest powers. The net structural pressure, however, tilts heavily toward entrenched authoritarian governance.\

Week 12 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. Trump administration withdrew federal funding from universities over diversity programs and protest guidelines (2025-04-05): The administration used federal grant leverage to force universities to abandon diversity programs and adopt restrictive protest rules, pressuring academic institutions to align with its political framing of antisemitism and campus dissent.\
\
2. President Trump appointed Paula White to lead a new White House faith office and task force on anti-Christian bias (2025-04-05): Creating a White House faith office led by a loyal televangelist embedded a particular religious ideology inside the executive, blurring church\'96state boundaries and giving it influence over policy.\
\
3. US Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly addressed speculation about President Trump serving a third term (2025-04-06): Bondi\'92s comments on the difficulty of amending the Constitution to allow a third presidential term signaled that the idea is being entertained within the administration, testing norms around term limits.\
\
4. President Trump planned a large military parade in Washington, DC (2025-04-06): Announcing a birthday military parade through the capital used armed forces as political spectacle, reinforcing personalized rule and symbolic militarization of public space.\
\
5. President Trump signed an executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution\'92s content (2025-04-07): Ordering the Smithsonian to purge \'93improper\'94 or \'93anti-American\'94 ideology from museums centralized control over national historical narratives inside the executive branch.\
\
6.

\
7. President Trump announced unexpectedly high tariffs on many imports on \'93Liberation Day\'94 (2025-04-06): Trump\'92s unilateral tariff announcement under emergency framing restructured trade policy by decree, bypassing normal legislative deliberation and jolting global markets.\
\
8.

\
12. President Trump insisted Apple iPhones would be manufactured in the United States under his tariff policy (2025-04-09): Publicly pressuring a major firm to relocate production under threat of tariffs illustrated executive use of economic coercion to direct private industrial decisions.\

\
14. President Trump issued an executive order targeting Susman Godfrey law firm over perceived threats to American interests (2025-04-09): Labeling a private law firm as a national security risk and directing agencies to curtail its access and contracts blurred lines between legal advocacy and state-defined enemies.\

\
16. President Trump ordered the Department of Justice to stop enforcing certain state climate liability laws (2025-04-09): Directing DOJ not to defend or enforce state climate \'93superfund\'94 laws undercut state efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable, centralizing climate policy in the executive.\
\
17. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leadership terminated hundreds of climate-focused employees after a Supreme Court ruling (2025-04-11): Mass firings of climate scientists at NOAA, enabled by a high court decision, weakened federal scientific capacity and increased executive control over environmental information.\
\
18. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered State Department staff to report alleged anti-Christian bias from the prior administration (2025-04-11): Compelling diplomats to catalogue past \'93anti-Christian bias\'94 repurposed the foreign service for an ideological audit, intertwining religious grievance with state policy.\
\
19.

5. Federal judiciary and Supreme Court issued and modified orders on the deportation and return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia (2025-04-10): A sequence of district and Supreme Court orders requiring the government to treat Abrego Garcia as if never deported and to facilitate his return tested judicial authority over executive immigration actions.\
\
6. Supreme Court of the United States allowed use of the Alien Enemies Act for Venezuelan deportations with procedural limits (2025-04-07): By upholding deportations under an 18th-century wartime law while channeling challenges to Texas courts, the Court expanded executive deportation tools and constrained forum choice for migrants.\
\
7. Supreme Court of the United States stayed lower-court orders requiring rehiring of thousands of fired federal probationary workers (2025-04-08): Administrative stays that let mass probationary firings proceed preserved executive discretion over the civil service and limited unions\'92 and nonprofits\'92 ability to challenge such purges.\

\
10.

\
11. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden ordered the White House to restore Associated Press access to presidential events (2025-04-08): The ruling that viewpoint-based press bans violated the First Amendment reaffirmed judicial protection of media access against retaliatory executive restrictions.\
\
12.

13. North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court ordered and then stayed a recount and ID verification for tens of thousands of ballots in a state supreme court race (2025-04-08): Appellate orders to re-verify 60,000 ballots, followed by a temporary stay, created uncertainty over voter eligibility rules and judicial roles in close elections.\
\
14. U.S. Supreme Court required the government to treat Abrego Garcia\'92s case as if he had not been deported (2025-04-10): Clarifying that courts could order effective relief even after removal, the Court asserted its authority to remedy unconstitutional deportations despite executive resistance.\
\

\
6. ICE arrested an asylum seeker complying with check-ins and expanded use of private detention facilities (2025-04-06): Detaining compliant asylum seekers and planning $45 billion in new, lower-standard private facilities entrenched a punitive, profit-driven detention regime.\

Information, Memory and Manipulation\
