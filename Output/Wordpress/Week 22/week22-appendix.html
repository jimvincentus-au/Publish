<h1>Week 22 Appendix: Citizenship as Sorting Mechanism</h1>
<p><em>A week of layered decisions that turned immigration, protest, markets, and memory into tools for ranking who belongs and who may be punished.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an executive willing to use nearly every lever of state power—military, regulatory, immigration, public health, and information—to entrench personal rule and punish opponents, while courts and civil society mount fragmented but real resistance. Immigration enforcement is overtly politicized: ICE raids and SWAT-style deployments are targeted at “Democrat power centers,” elected officials and journalists are arrested or funneled into ICE custody, and DHS moves to block congressional oversight of detention facilities. Simultaneously, Trump centralizes economic and media power through control of U.S. Steel, crypto deregulation, and the dismantling of Voice of America, while regulatory enforcement against donors is relaxed. Civil–military boundaries erode as National Guard and Marines are deployed over state objections and appellate courts bless federal control. Public health capacity is sharply degraded by mass firings, funding cuts, and politicized vaccine policy. Against this, courts block some executive overreach (NIH and EPA grant cuts, passport restrictions, Education and DOJ moves), Congress advances war-powers and anti-corruption bills, and millions mobilize in “No Kings” protests. Structurally, however, the balance tilts toward normalized emergency governance, stratified citizenship, and crony capitalism fused with state authority.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump issued executive orders targeting sanctuary cities for defunding and prosecution of officials: The orders sought to punish jurisdictions resisting federal immigration policy, using fiscal threats and criminal prosecution to pressure local officials and expand centralized executive control over immigration enforcement.

(2025-06-15)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered ICE to focus mass deportations on Democratic-run cities he labeled &quot;Democrat Power Centers&quot;: Directing immigration raids toward political opponents’ jurisdictions politicized federal enforcement power, threatening equal protection and using deportation policy as a partisan weapon. (2025-06-15)</li>
<li>President Trump and senior aides set and then reversed limits on ICE workplace raids in agriculture, hotel, and restaurant sectors: The rapid policy whiplash on worksite raids, influenced by donor-heavy industries, showed executive enforcement priorities being driven by political and economic favoritism rather than stable rule-based governance. (2025-06-17)</li>
<li>President Trump announced a $5 million &quot;Trump Card&quot; program offering permanent U.S. residency: Creating an ultra-expensive residency track tied to the president’s brand blurred lines between public immigration authority and private enrichment, and further stratified access to residency by wealth. (2025-06-16)</li>

(2025-06-18)</li>
<li>President Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 presidential election as fraudulent: Renewed demands for criminal investigation of a settled election, based on false fraud claims, further undermined confidence in electoral legitimacy and normalized using prosecutorial power against political outcomes. (2025-06-19)</li>
<li>President Trump directed the Department of Energy to keep Michigan coal plants open despite planned closures: The directive overrode market and state regulatory decisions on plant retirement, centralizing control over energy infrastructure in the executive and weakening state-level climate governance.

<li>Federal courts issued rulings allowing transgender passport gender markers and blocking an &quot;X&quot; marker ban: By enjoining enforcement of a birth-sex-only passport rule and protecting &quot;X&quot; markers, judges defended transgender and nonbinary individuals’ access to accurate federal identification against discriminatory executive policy. (2025-06-17)</li>
<li>U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors: The decision narrowed equal-protection interpretations for transgender youth and signaled judicial deference to state restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare, reshaping civil-rights baselines nationwide. (2025-06-18)</li>
<li>U.S. Supreme Court allowed fossil fuel companies and states to challenge California’s stricter vehicle emission standards: By granting standing to attack California’s long-standing emissions waiver, the Court opened a path to weaken state-led climate regulation that has often driven national standards.
