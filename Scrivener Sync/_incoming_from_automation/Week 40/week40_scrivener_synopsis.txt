Week 40 of Trump’s second term unfolded on two planes. In the streets, 7–8 million people joined peaceful “No Kings” protests across all fifty states and beyond, insisting that dissent is a core democratic act. Inside government, the presidency treated law, money, and memory as private instruments. Trump demolished the East Wing to build a donor-funded ballroom, bypassing preservation rules and public oversight, while Treasury gagged nearby staff and donors with active business before the government underwrote the project. A vast Argentina bailout, elite pardons for George Santos and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, and a DOJ payout scheme deepened crony capitalism, shifting risk to the public and reward to insiders. The justice system pursued critics like Letitia James and James Comey even as deportation orders and court injunctions were flouted. Congress extended the record shutdown, refused to seat Adelita Grijalva, and used recess to avoid votes on worker pay and Epstein files. The Democracy Clock did not move past 11:24 p.m., not because conditions improved, but because late-stage traits—law as weapon, wealth as shield, memory curated by power—were already near saturation. The structure still stands; the moral floor sags.
