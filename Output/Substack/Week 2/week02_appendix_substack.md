# Week 2 Appendix: Law and Memory as Weapons

*In Trump’s second week back in power, pardons, purges, and data erasure turned law, citizenship, and information into tools of loyalty and fear.*

![Header image](image_wide_week2_appendix.png)

This was an acute rupture week: a sitting president used executive power to attack nearly every major democratic safeguard simultaneously, while courts and civil society mounted only partial, reactive resistance. Structurally, the heaviest pressure fell on civil service independence, oversight institutions, immigration/citizenship equality, and the rule of law. Trump’s mass firings of inspectors general, DOJ and FBI officials, NLRB and EEOC leaders, combined with Schedule F–style civil service politicization and mass resignation offers, directly hollowed out neutral administration. Parallel moves—blanket pardons for January 6 offenders, closing Jan. 6 cases, and purging prosecutors—recast law as a weapon of the executive and removed accountability for regime-aligned violence. Immigration and citizenship policy shifted toward stratified status and mass detention, including Guantánamo expansion, raids in schools and churches, and attempts to end birthright citizenship. Information and memory were aggressively curated through DEI purges, climate and Jan. 6 data removal, and education orders targeting ‘indoctrination.’ Courts blocked some funding freezes and the birthright order, and state and civil society actors sued over raids and civil service politicization, but these were defensive brakes against a coordinated power grab.
