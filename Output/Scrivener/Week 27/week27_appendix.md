# Week 27 Appendix: Law and Code as Weapons

This was an exceptionally heavy week for democratic erosion, with the executive consolidating power across law enforcement, regulation, information, and social policy. Structurally, the sharpest pressures fell on rule-of-law traits (4, 9, 22, 51), as DOJ and ICE were further politicized and expanded, consent decrees and police reforms were rolled back, and a new Obama-focused “strike force” signaled overt use of prosecutorial power against political enemies. Regulatory and economic capture (16, 26, 38) deepened via crypto- and AI-friendly orders, agency purges, and politically conditioned mergers, while homelessness, immigration, and environmental policy were reframed as security or culture-war problems rather than rights or welfare questions. Information control and press targeting (42, 43, 52–54, 60) intensified through lawsuits, pool bans, AI propaganda networks, altered human-rights reporting, and historical document dumps used as distraction. There were meaningful countervailing judicial and civil-society actions—courts repeatedly blocking the birthright-citizenship order and protecting some immigrant rights; oversight pushes on Epstein files; grassroots mobilization around immigration and state-level democracy—but these gains were modest relative to the breadth of centralizing, punitive moves.

Week 27 Events

Power and Authority

1. President Trump and the Environmental Protection Agency eliminated the EPA's research and development office and began mass layoffs (2025-07-19): The administration cut thousands of EPA staff and dismantled its research arm, weakening federal capacity to generate independent environmental science that informs regulation and public health protections.

3.

4. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard referred former President Obama and officials to DOJ for treason investigations over 2016 intelligence (2025-07-19): Referring a prior administration for treason based on claims contradicting prior bipartisan findings signaled use of national security institutions to pursue political retribution rather than evidence-based accountability.

President Trump ordered redistricting of Texas congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms (2025-07-25): Directing a state’s redistricting process to entrench partisan advantage, amid DOJ concerns about racial gerrymanders, represented an extraordinary assertion of national executive influence over representation.

17.

US Department of Agriculture under Secretary Brooke Rollins announced salary cuts, office closures, and relocation of thousands of USDA staff (2025-07-24): Restructuring USDA by cutting pay and moving staff out of Washington weakened federal capacity to deliver agricultural and food-safety services, while aligning the agency with broader downsizing goals.
