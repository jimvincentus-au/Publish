# Week 14 Appendix: Universities and Borders as Levers

*A near-still Democracy Clock masks a week in which the White House tightened control over courts, campuses, and civil rights while testing the limits of law.*

![Header image](image_wide_week14_appendix.png)

This was a structurally heavy week of democratic backsliding, centered on aggressive executive overreach, weaponization of law, and systematic attacks on pluralistic institutions. The administration escalated its campaign against universities through massive funding freezes, coercive conditions on academic governance, and new accreditation and DEI–rollback orders, pushing Trait 44 (universities pressured to suppress dissent) into crisis territory. Immigration enforcement and detention policy hardened further: closure of key oversight offices, wrongful detentions of citizens, politicized targeting of student activists, and contempt findings over deportations collectively deepened Traits 4, 9, 47, and 1. Civil-rights enforcement was structurally rewritten via the disparate-impact order and disability/Medicaid cuts, entrenching stratified citizenship and inequality. Inside the state, Interior and State Department restructurings, DOGE’s opaque data practices, and Musk/Hegseth’s behavior signaled accelerating capture and politicization of the civil service and security apparatus. Yet courts and civil society mounted notable resistance: multiple federal rulings blocked sanctuary-city defunding, voter-document mandates, and deportations; Harvard and state AGs sued; and nationwide protests and university presidents’ statements showed organized pushback. Overall, the week’s net pressure strongly favored authoritarian consolidation despite pockets of institutional resilience.

Power and Authority

1. The Trump administration cut and froze over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard University and threatened its tax-exempt status (2025-04-20): By conditioning core research and institutional funding on ideological concessions and governance changes, the administration used fiscal power to coerce a private university, pressuring academic freedom and institutional autonomy.

2. The Trump administration expanded coal mining for data center energy while cutting miner health and safety agencies and delaying a silica dust rule (2025-04-19): Executive promotion of coal extraction alongside weakened safety enforcement shifted risks onto workers and communities, prioritizing industrial output over regulatory protections and long-term public health.

3. The Trump administration pursued a campaign to restructure the Justice Department and FBI by removing career prosecutors and watchdogs (2025-04-19): Targeting independent law enforcement and oversight personnel for removal weakened institutional checks on executive power and increased vulnerability to politicized justice.

4. President Trump considered firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over interest rate policy (2025-04-19): Threatening to remove the central bank chair for policy disagreements challenged Federal Reserve independence, risking politicization of monetary policy and economic management.

5. President Trump indicated he would ignore the Supreme Court’s order to facilitate Kilmar Ábrego García’s return from El Salvador (2025-04-21): Openly rejecting a Supreme Court mandate on a wrongful deportation case signaled disregard for judicial authority and separation of powers in immigration enforcement.

6. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened New York with loss of federal transportation funding unless it halted Manhattan congestion pricing (2025-04-21): Using federal funding leverage to coerce a state’s transportation policy tested federalism norms and enabled selective punishment of disfavored jurisdictions.

7. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem prepared a report to President Trump on whether to invoke the Insurrection Act at the southern border and reportedly declined to recommend it (2025-04-21): Considering but stepping back from using military force for domestic border enforcement highlighted the availability of extraordinary powers and the importance of internal restraint.

8. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum signed an order consolidating control of Interior’s personnel and budget under a politically connected assistant secretary (2025-04-18): Centralizing Interior’s administrative authority in a political operative with energy ties reduced internal checks over public lands and resource policy and raised appointments-clause concerns.

9. The White House celebrated Earth Day by promoting expanded extraction of oil, gas, and minerals from federal lands and waters (2025-04-22): Framing aggressive extraction on public lands as stewardship signaled executive prioritization of resource exploitation over environmental safeguards and long-term public interests.

10. President Trump issued a memorandum directing the attorney general to investigate alleged foreign and straw donations through ActBlue (2025-04-24): Ordering a high-profile probe of a major opposition fundraising platform risked weaponizing federal law enforcement against political rivals under disputed factual claims.

19. President Trump issued an executive order establishing a White House initiative on HBCUs and a presidential advisory board (2025-04-23): Centralizing HBCU policy in a White House initiative created new channels for support but also for political influence over historically Black institutions’ priorities.

20. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins ordered staff to report perceived anti-Christian bias through a new taskforce mechanism (2025-04-22): Directing federal employees to flag “anti-Christian bias” institutionalized preferential attention to one faith identity, risking uneven treatment of religious expression and workplace rights.

21. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed large cuts to disability-related education, research, and support services (2025-04-24): Planned reductions in disability services would shrink federal support for a vulnerable population, deepening inequality in access to care and inclusion.

22. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted key autism research tied to DEIA programs (2025-04-24): Stopping autism projects associated with diversity and accessibility initiatives curtailed scientific inquiry into disability and equity, narrowing evidence for inclusive policy.

30. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a sweeping reorganization of the State Department cutting staff and democracy-related offices (2025-04-22): Planned reductions in bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and global issues signaled a shift away from traditional diplomatic missions toward a leaner, more centralized foreign policy apparatus.

31. Secretary of State Marco Rubio withdrew from scheduled London peace talks after presenting a Ukraine peace plan as a final offer (2025-04-24): Treating a controversial Ukraine settlement as non-negotiable and exiting talks reduced diplomatic flexibility and aligned U.S. posture more closely with Russian territorial claims.

32. President Trump publicly pressured Ukraine’s president to accept a peace plan recognizing Russian claims over occupied territories (2025-04-24): Urging acceptance of a settlement favoring Russian annexations undermined support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and signaled tolerance for authoritarian aggression abroad.
