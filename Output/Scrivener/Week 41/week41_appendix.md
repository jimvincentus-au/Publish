# Week 41 Appendix: Shutdown as Method

This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the executive leveraging the shutdown, immigration panic, and external conflicts to centralize power and monetize crisis. Structurally, the heaviest pressure fell on executive constraint, civil service neutrality, rule-of-law integrity, and the social safety net. Trump’s personalist use of state power—pardoning a crypto ally tied to his family business, demanding $230m from DOJ, and demolishing the White House East Wing for a donor-funded ballroom—deepened crony capitalism and blurred public–private boundaries. Immigration and internal security policy were retooled through secretive Stephen Miller–run processes, mass ICE leadership purges, militarized Border Patrol deployments in cities, and visa revocations targeting critics, entrenching a stratified citizenship regime. The shutdown became a weapon: SNAP and CDC capacity were deliberately strangled until courts intervened, illustrating both executive abuse and residual judicial resilience. Simultaneously, Congress oscillated between paralysis on funding and rare bipartisan checks on tariff powers. Abroad, nuclear testing orders, lethal maritime strikes, and transactional bailouts of Argentina and pressure on allies signaled a more openly lawless, personalized foreign policy, drawing UN scrutiny and heightening global-democracy concerns.
