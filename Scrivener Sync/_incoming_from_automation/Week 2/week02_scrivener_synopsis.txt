Week 2 of Trump’s second term is when improvisation becomes system. The presidency moves to strip away independent oversight, firing at least 18 inspectors general and disbanding or paralyzing civil-rights and labor-enforcement bodies. A Schedule F–style overhaul and mass resignation offers begin refashioning the civil service into a loyalty workforce, aided by Elon Musk–aligned control over federal personnel data. Law is redeployed as a weapon: more than 1,500 January 6 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, are pardoned while DOJ and FBI officials who investigated Trump are purged and the January 6 case database is erased. Simultaneously, the boundaries of belonging are redrawn through an attempted end to birthright citizenship, revocation of protections for Venezuelans, aggressive ICE raids, and plans for mass detention at Guantánamo Bay and a Space Force base. Emergency powers, deregulation, and information control knit these moves together. Courts and civil society win temporary injunctions and mount resistance, but the Democracy Clock jumps from 7:31 to 8:02 p.m., recording a dense, structural turn toward rule by loyalty and impunity.
