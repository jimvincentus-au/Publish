# Week 39 Appendix: Shutdown as Weaponized Governance

*With Congress stalled, the White House turned budgets, law enforcement, and public memory into tools for punishing opponents and narrowing democratic space.*

![Header image](image_wide_week39_appendix.png)

This week shows a sharp consolidation of executive power and a coordinated assault on multiple democratic guardrails. The administration weaponized law and bureaucracy against opponents (Antifa “terrorist” designation, Soros RICO probe, Bolton and Comey/James indictments, IRS targeting plans) while simultaneously purging and constraining the civil service through mass layoffs, a sweeping federal hiring freeze, and loyalty-driven purges. Federal power and money were openly used as partisan weapons: shutdown-driven layoffs and selective funding freezes hit Democratic regions hardest, while crony bailouts and foreign-policy quid pro quos with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina deepened emoluments-style corruption. Civil liberties came under pressure from militarized immigration raids, threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, domestic troop deployments, and a new NSPM redefining dissent as extremism. Press freedom and academic autonomy were attacked via Pentagon gag rules, defamation suits, campus compacts, and student-media censorship. At the same time, courts, states, universities, unions, and media mounted notable resistance—blocking Guard deployments, layoffs, ICE abuses, H‑1B fees, and Pentagon press rules—highlighting that while structural pressure toward competitive authoritarianism is intense, countervailing institutions are still active but under strain.

Power and Authority

1. President Trump signed a memo designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization (2025-10-11): The memo used terrorism framing against a loosely defined leftist movement, expanding executive power to surveil and disrupt political opponents without clear statutory authority.

2. President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports (2025-10-11): The unilateral tariff threat asserted presidential control over trade policy traditionally shared with Congress, risking economic disruption while testing limits on executive authority in economic governance.

3. President Trump exempted the AI sector and its supply chain from broad tariffs (2025-10-12): Shielding AI from tariffs highlighted selective use of trade tools to favor strategic industries, concentrating state support in sectors aligned with national power and influential firms.

4. Vice President JD Vance said the administration was considering invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy National Guard in Democratic-led cities (2025-10-12): Floating Insurrection Act deployment against unrest in opposition-run cities normalized extraordinary domestic military powers as a tool for managing protest and local governance.

5. President Trump issued an executive order guaranteeing Qatar’s security and naming it a steadfast ally (2025-10-14): Granting NATO-style security assurances to Qatar after major gifts and investments blurred lines between national security commitments and personal or financial ties.

6. President Trump ordered the firing of nearly all staff in the Office of Population Affairs (2025-10-14): Gutting the office overseeing family-planning programs concentrated policy control in political appointees and threatened continuity of reproductive health services nationwide.

7. President Trump proclaimed Columbus Day as a celebration of the “original American hero” (2025-10-13): The proclamation advanced a white Christian nationalist narrative of U.S. history, using presidential symbolism to marginalize critical accounts of conquest and Indigenous suffering.

8. President Trump promoted an ideological shift away from the Social Security model of government (2025-10-14): Framing social welfare as contrary to “rugged individualism” signaled an executive push to roll back the state’s protective role, weakening support for broad-based social rights.

9. President Trump issued an executive order tightly restricting federal civilian hiring (2025-10-15): The hiring order centralized staffing decisions in political hands and constrained agencies’ ability to fill positions, increasing executive leverage over the civil service.

10. President Trump issued an executive order declaring that any armed attack on Qatar threatens U.S. peace and security (2025-10-14): Extending a de facto security guarantee to Qatar without treaty ratification expanded presidential war-and-peace commitments outside normal congressional processes.

11. President Trump announced plans for a triumphal arch and privately funded White House ballroom in Washington (2025-10-16): Leader-centric monuments and lavish renovations funded by private donors entwined personal glorification with public space, raising concerns about influence and symbolic dominance.

12. President Trump claimed authority to pay furloughed troops using future-year Pentagon funds despite legal doubts (2025-10-16): By asserting power to repurpose appropriated defense funds without Congress, the president challenged statutory budget controls and expanded unilateral fiscal authority.

13. President Trump directed the Pentagon to reallocate research funds to cover military payroll during the shutdown (2025-10-14): Redirecting research money to pay troops during a funding lapse prioritized military pay over legal appropriations processes, deepening executive control over budget execution.

14. President Trump fired independent inspectors general and other watchdogs viewed as disloyal (2025-10-16): Removing internal watchdogs weakened institutional checks on executive misconduct and signaled that oversight roles depend on political loyalty.

15. President Trump pardoned January 6 rioters who assaulted police officers (2025-10-16): Pardoning violent participants in an attack on Congress undermined accountability for political violence and encouraged future lawless action by regime-aligned actors.

16. President Trump purged career officials deemed disloyal from federal agencies (2025-10-16): Targeted removals of nonpartisan staff further politicized the bureaucracy, eroding neutral expertise and entrenching loyalty-based governance.

18. President Trump deployed federal troops to U.S. cities in response to unrest (2025-10-16): Domestic troop deployments blurred civil–military boundaries and risked intimidating protesters and local officials, weakening civilian control norms.

19. President Trump announced lethal strikes on boats off Venezuela’s coast in anti-drug operations (2025-10-15): Repeated lethal actions in international waters, justified with limited transparency, expanded executive war-making and raised questions about proportionality and oversight.

20. President Trump authorized covert CIA operations, including lethal force, to pressure Venezuela’s government (2025-10-15): Secret authorization of lethal covert operations for regime change in Venezuela deepened opaque uses of force with minimal public or congressional scrutiny.

21. President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina later doubled to $40 billion (2025-10-15): The Argentina bailout, acknowledged as offering little U.S. benefit while aiding a hedge fund ally, illustrated executive use of public funds to favor connected investors.

22. President Trump agreed to a $142 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia following major Saudi investments in Trump-linked entities (2025-10-14): The massive arms package intertwined U.S. security policy with private financial relationships, heightening concerns about emoluments and foreign influence.

23. President Trump accepted a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One (2025-10-14): Accepting an extravagant state gift tied to later policy shifts toward Qatar blurred personal enrichment and official decision-making in foreign relations.

24. President Trump oversaw a $2 billion pre-sale of a Trump-linked stablecoin to a UAE state fund (2025-10-14): The early stablecoin purchase by a foreign sovereign fund, followed by chip-export concessions, showed state policy intertwined with private digital-asset ventures tied to the president.

25. President Trump announced he had ordered destruction of a boat in the Caribbean, killing six people (2025-10-14): Publicly touting lethal maritime action as a presidential decision highlighted personalized control over use of force with limited legal explanation.

28. President Trump publicly attacked judges and called for impeachment of U.S. judges at the urging of El Salvador’s president (2025-10-12): Endorsing rhetoric to impeach judges over adverse rulings further eroded respect for judicial independence and encouraged politicized attacks on the courts.

29. President Trump used automated government email replies to blame Democrats for the shutdown (2025-10-11): Using official email systems for partisan blame messaging violated norms against politicizing government resources and blurred lines between state communication and campaign propaganda.

30. President Trump announced a national strategy to investigate liberal groups as potential domestic terror networks (2025-10-11): Targeting funding and investigations at ideologically defined “domestic terror networks” expanded executive tools to suppress dissenting civil society organizations.

31. President Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate George Soros’ Open Society Foundations under RICO (2025-10-11): Launching a RICO probe into a major philanthropic organization closely associated with opposition causes weaponized criminal law against a perceived political enemy.

32. President Trump announced a crackdown on legal immigration including a $100,000 H-1B fee, refugee cuts, and law-enforcement powers for USCIS (2025-10-11): Sweeping changes to legal immigration raised financial and enforcement barriers, stratifying access to residency and work by wealth and origin.

33. President Trump announced mass layoffs and threatened firing 4,200 federal employees during the shutdown (2025-10-11): Using large-scale layoffs as leverage in a budget standoff turned federal employment into a bargaining chip, pressuring workers and Congress alike.

34. President Trump announced selective cancellation and freezing of over $27 billion in federal funds, mostly in Democratic areas (2025-10-14): Targeted funding cuts during the shutdown used federal spending power to punish political opponents and reshape regional resource distribution.

36. President Trump cut a $20 million flood-protection grant for the Alaska Native village of Kipnuk (2025-10-15): Eliminating disaster-protection funding for a vulnerable Indigenous community prioritized budget cuts over basic safety, exacerbating inequality in climate resilience.

37. President Trump announced plans to change IRS leadership and investigative practices to target left-leaning groups and donors (2025-10-15): Politicizing IRS criminal investigations threatened to turn tax enforcement into a tool against political opponents rather than a neutral application of law.

38. President Trump pressured universities to sign a federal higher-education compact tying funding to policy changes (2025-10-15): Offering preferential funding in exchange for curbs on DEI and international students sought to align academic governance with executive ideology.

39. President Trump restricted press freedom through attacks on judges, universities, and media outlets (2025-10-16): Broader efforts to delegitimize independent institutions and the press supported a climate where criticism of the executive is framed as disloyal or dangerous.

40. President Trump used shutdown chaos, raids, tariffs, and foreign strikes in overlapping fashion (2025-10-17): The convergence of multiple self-generated crises fragmented public attention and complicated oversight, making it harder to hold the executive accountable.
