This action contradicts Marriott's 2019 pledge not to allow its properties to be used for detaining immigrants. The Intercept reported the incident, citing phone-tracking evidence. The use of hotels by ICE for detaining immigrants has been documented, despite Marriott's previous public stance against such practices. The situation raises questions about Marriott's current policies and ICE's operational methods.",

The lawsuit, filed by two non-profit law firms, targets two state laws that prevent the public service commission from considering pollution when permitting fossil fuel plants and from requiring utilities to increase carbon-free energy sources. The plaintiffs argue these laws violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by perpetuating an oil and gas-based electricity sector.

This decision marks an escalation in the federal government's intervention in policing the nation's capital, where nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed. The Pentagon had previously stated that troops would not carry weapons. The move comes amid President Trump's federal crackdown on crime in Democratic-voting cities, including New York and Chicago, each led by Black mayors.",
