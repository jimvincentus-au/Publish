Title\
-----\
Court Orders Against Defiant Power\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A week of aggressive executive defiance on immigration, education, and security meets hard\uc0\u8209 pressed judges, universities, and protesters straining to hold the line.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
The hands of the Democracy Clock stay still, but only because judges, campuses, and crowds absorb the shock of a presidency testing every remaining guardrail.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 14 captures a stark equilibrium: the Democracy Clock holds at 7:51 p.m., but only because judicial and civic resistance barely counterbalances accelerating executive aggression. The administration defies court orders on deportations, misuses the Alien Enemies Act, and sweeps even U.S. citizens into a punitive immigration system while shuttering detention oversight offices. Universities face weaponized funding cuts, intrusive investigations, and ideological accreditation orders, prompting lawsuits and coordinated public resistance. Health, disability, environmental, and foreign policy are recast through loyalist restructurings and emergency declarations, from Interior\'92s fast\uc0\u8209 tracked extraction permits to State\'92s hollowed\u8209 out human\u8209 rights capacity and a Ukraine \'93final offer\'94 that trades away sovereignty. Inside the Pentagon, unsecured communications and purges erode professional norms. Yet federal courts block sanctuary\u8209 city defunding, voter proof\u8209 of\u8209 citizenship rules, union\u8209 busting, and media shutdowns, while mass protests and local voting reforms expand participation. The hour does not advance, but the guardrails visibly strain.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
Executive power is wielded more openly as a weapon\'97against immigrants, universities, and oversight\'97while courts, universities, unions, and protesters mount fragile but real resistance that keeps the clock from advancing.\

Intensifying executive defiance and institutional hollowing are offset, for now, by injunctions, Supreme Court orders, and mass civic mobilization\'97signaling not safety, but a precarious stalemate.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A symbolic still life: a judge\'92s gavel cracked but unbroken resting on a stack of legal briefs stamped with red denial marks, beside a university ID card, a passport, and a small pocket Constitution. Behind them, a metal detention key and a dimly glowing digital clock reading 7:51. Painterly, realistic, dramatic lighting, no text, no recognizable faces.", "wide": "A dusk-lit cityscape with a massive courthouse on one side and a gleaming executive building on the other, a large clock face suspended between them frozen at 7:51 p.m. Below, crowds of protesters with indistinct faces hold candles and signs, while lines of uniformed officers and suited officials move in opposite directions. Subtle details hint at universities, detention buses, and military drones in the background, painterly realism, moody, high contrast, no text."\}\
