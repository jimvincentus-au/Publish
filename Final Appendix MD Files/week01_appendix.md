# Week 1 Appendix: Citizenship as Executive Weapon

This week is a concentrated shock to nearly every democratic safeguard at once. Trump’s return to office is immediately operationalized through a blizzard of executive orders that centralize power in the presidency, politicize the civil service, and weaponize law enforcement and clemency. Immigration is the primary testing ground: mass-deportation architecture, suspension of asylum and refugee programs, nationwide expedited removal, and attempts to redefine birthright citizenship all move the system toward stratified citizenship enforced by militarized borders. Simultaneously, DEI and civil-rights infrastructures are dismantled, abortion and gender policies are rewritten along theocratic lines, and watchdogs—inspectors general, DOJ civil-rights enforcement, independent regulators—are purged or subordinated. Internationally, withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and WHO, broad aid freezes, and transactional use of tariffs and designations signal a retreat from rules-based cooperation. The mass pardoning of January 6 offenders, coupled with a new House panel to rewrite that history, normalizes paramilitary politics and erodes accountability for attacks on the peaceful transfer of power. A parallel track of crypto schemes, foreign-branded real estate, and regulatory capture fuses personal enrichment with state policy. Courts and civil society push back on birthright citizenship and DOGE transparency, but they are swimming against a coordinated authoritarian tide.
