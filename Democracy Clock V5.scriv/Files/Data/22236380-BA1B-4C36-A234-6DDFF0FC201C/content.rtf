By Week 26, the story of Trump\'92s second term had settled into a hard pattern. Power was no longer only claimed in speeches or rallies; it was being wired into the state\'92s circuitry\'97into personnel rules, data systems, court dockets, and budget lines. The Democracy Clock moved from 7:57 p.m. to 7:58 p.m., a shift of less than a minute, but the small movement masked a heavy week. What changed was not a single dramatic break, but the quiet consolidation of tools that make future breaks easier, cheaper, and harder to reverse. A government that once answered to law and shared facts was being refitted to answer first to the executive and his coalition, with law, data, and force bent to that end. That was the week\'92s core theme.\
\
The previous period had left the clock at 7:57 p.m., already well past the safe hours of a healthy democracy. In Week 26 it advanced by 0.7 minutes to 7:58 p.m. The movement came from a cluster of structural shifts. Schedule G and mass purges pushed the civil service further under political control. Immigration enforcement became a laboratory for rule by exception, where due process and privacy were treated as optional. Surveillance expanded downward onto ordinary people even as transparency narrowed upward around elite wrongdoing. Congress, instead of acting as a brake, largely ratified this direction by cutting public media and foreign aid, tolerating partisan maps, and blocking disclosure in the Epstein affair. Courts sent mixed signals, but the most consequential rulings and appointments favored executive freedom and entrenched power. The net effect was to deepen traits the Clock tracks as late-hour risks: law as weapon, stratified citizenship, unchecked executive authority, and information systems that serve power rather than the public.\
\
The most far-reaching development of the week was the formal politicization of the federal workforce. On July 17, Trump signed an order creating Schedule G in the excepted service, a new classification for \'93policy-making or policy-advocating\'94 roles that could be filled and emptied at presidential will. The order was framed as a way to \'93improve operations\'94 at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but its reach extended across agencies. In practice, it meant that thousands of positions once shielded by merit rules could now be treated as political spoils. This did not just change who held those jobs; it changed what those jobs were for. A civil servant who knows she can be fired for crossing a political line will read the law differently. Fear becomes part of the job description.\
\
Schedule G landed in a landscape already being cleared of independent voices. At the State Department, more than 1,300 employees were laid off and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was closed, removing a long-standing center of rights advocacy from U.S. diplomacy. At the Department of Education, a reduction in force that would cut nearly half the workforce had been blocked by a lower court, but the Supreme Court stepped in with an emergency stay, allowing the layoffs to proceed. The Court\'92s 6\'963 decision did more than greenlight a single downsizing; it signaled that statutory limits on executive personnel moves could be brushed aside when they interfered with presidential plans. At the Justice Department, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Joseph Tirrell, the head of the ethics office, and more than twenty other career lawyers, while nearly two-thirds of the unit tasked with defending Trump policies resigned rather than continue work they believed aimed at dismantling constitutional governance. The National Institutes of Health prepared to dismiss scientists from advisory panels and replace them with politically aligned figures. These moves shifted the civil service trait on the Democracy Clock. Neutral administration gave way to a workforce selected and retained for loyalty, not law.\
\
The justice system itself was pulled further into this orbit. Bondi\'92s DOJ dropped charges against a Utah doctor who had destroyed COVID vaccines and issued fake cards, recasting him as a provider of \'93choice\'94 rather than a fraud defendant. The department fired Maurene Comey, a career prosecutor who had worked on the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases and on other high-profile matters, without giving a substantive reason. Her dismissal, echoed in multiple reports, came alongside the firing of other prosecutors and the ethics chief, and amid political pressure over the Epstein files. In Kentucky, DOJ asked for a one-day sentence for Brett Hankison, the former officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor\'92s civil rights, despite the gravity of the underlying raid. In immigration courts, the administration fired judges even as Congress had just funded more positions, and it appealed a ruling that barred racial profiling in ICE raids. A class-action suit accused DHS and DOJ of colluding to arrest immigrants at courthouse hearings, and another challenged courthouse arrests as unconstitutional. These cases showed resistance. But the pattern of decisions from the top\'97dropping inconvenient prosecutions, seeking leniency for police abuses, reshaping immigration adjudication\'97moved the \'93law as weapon, not limit\'94 trait forward. Law was being used to protect allies, punish enemies, and clear space for executive projects, rather than to stand above them.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the clearest field where this new logic played out. Early in the week, Trump authorized ICE agents to use \'93whatever means\'94 necessary to protect themselves and ordered the arrest of protesters who impeded operations. That language, vague and maximal, widened the acceptable use of force. On the ground, ICE raids at licensed cannabis farms in California used tear gas and less-lethal ammunition, injuring workers and protesters; one farm worker, Jaime Alan\'eds, died after falling from a greenhouse roof while fleeing agents. A professor who allegedly threw back a gas canister was charged with assaulting a federal officer. In Los Angeles, Terminal Island\'97once a site of Japanese American incarceration\'97was used as a staging ground for mass raids that had already swept up nearly 2,800 people. In Florida, the \'93Alligator Alcatraz\'94 detention facility held hundreds in overcrowded cages with poor sanitation; a Miami Herald report found more than 250 detainees had no criminal record, contradicting official claims that the site was reserved for the \'93worst of the worst.\'94 Democratic lawmakers were denied access and sued for entry. Environmental groups filed a separate suit arguing the facility was illegal and environmentally destructive.\
\
Policy changes tightened the net further. ICE Director Todd Lyons issued a memo allowing deportations to third countries with as little as six hours\'92 notice, often without assurances against persecution or torture. Another policy made undocumented immigrants ineligible for bond hearings while their deportation cases were pending, shifting release decisions from judges to DHS officials. A Guardian report described the administration\'92s plan to end bond hearings for those who entered without status, backed by a Republican Congress that had just allocated $45 billion to ICE detention over four years. In Oregon, ICE agents broke a car window to arrest Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, a chiropractor married to a U.S. citizen, as he dropped his child at preschool; in another case, an Irish tourist who overstayed his visa by three days due to a medical issue was held for about 100 days in criminal facilities before deportation and a ten-year ban. At \'93Alligator Alcatraz,\'94 more than 250 detainees had no criminal record. These stories were not isolated abuses. They were the human face of a system in which immigrants and refugees occupied a lower tier of rights, with fewer procedural protections and greater exposure to state power.\
\
Behind the visible raids, the data infrastructure of enforcement thickened. ProPublica reported that the IRS was developing a system to share confidential tax data, including home addresses, with ICE for deportation targeting, despite earlier legal objections from the agency\'92s own counsel. Separately, the administration struck an agreement to give ICE access to Medicaid data on up to 79 million recipients, including addresses and Social Security numbers, under the stated aim of preventing fraud. Career civil servants had warned of statutory violations, but their concerns were overridden. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a tax and spending law, poured more than $6 billion into border surveillance: biometric collection, license plate readers, phone hacking tools, and hundreds of new towers, much of it contracted to firms like Palantir and Anduril. These systems were justified as security measures, but they also entrenched a world in which ordinary people\'97especially the poor, the sick, and the foreign-born\'97were ever more visible to the state, while elite misconduct remained shielded behind secrecy and selective disclosure. The Democracy Clock registered this as a rise in surveillance of citizens and opacity around elite crimes.\
\
The same week saw a targeted rollback of equality norms in veterans\'92 care and language access. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, leadership banned LGBTQ+ pride flags from VA hospitals, shut down an office investigating why Black veterans\'92 mental health disability claims were more often rejected, and removed anti-discrimination language from hospital bylaws that had barred bias based on marital status or political views. The VA also ended gender-affirming care for transgender veterans, citing a Trump executive order, though one veteran\'92s lawsuit forced a temporary reversal in her individual case. These steps were presented as a refocus on \'93core\'94 services, but their effect was to narrow who counted as a full veteran in the eyes of the state. At DOJ, new guidance limited \'93non-essential multilingual services\'94 and redirected resources toward English-only education after an order designating English as the official language. For immigrants and minorities, this meant higher barriers to understanding their rights and navigating the justice system. The trait the Clock calls \'93citizenship stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage\'94 moved forward. The law\'92s protections and the state\'92s care were being sorted by identity.\
\
Elections and representation, the formal channels of consent, were also reshaped. In North Carolina, a Republican-majority elections board voted to require voters to provide additional registration data\'97driver\'92s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers\'97or risk being forced into provisional ballots that might not be counted. Nearly 100,000 voters could be purged under the plan, which the Democratic National Committee argued violated federal law and the Constitution. In Florida, the state supreme court upheld a congressional map that dismantled a district where Black voters had significant influence, splitting it into four majority-white districts and rejecting a challenge under the state\'92s Fair Districts Amendment. In Texas, Republicans, encouraged by Trump, prepared a mid-decade redraw of the congressional map to gain up to five new Republican seats, a move expected to dilute the growing non-white vote. The state\'92s attorney general threatened to arrest Democratic legislators who boycotted the special session to deny a quorum. California\'92s governor, in turn, threatened to bypass his state\'92s independent redistricting commission to counter Texas, though legal barriers made that unlikely. At the federal level, the Justice Department requested voter rolls from nine states to assemble election data and examine voting equipment, raising concerns about voter privacy and the potential misuse of centralized lists. These actions, taken together, advanced the trait of voter suppression rationalized as \'93integrity.\'94 The rules of who counts and how votes translate into seats were being tuned to favor those already in power.\
\
Information, the raw material of democratic judgment, came under pressure from several directions. The U.S. Agency for Global Media, home to Voice of America and other outlets, was largely dismantled, ending many foreign aid and influence programs and shrinking the country\'92s ability to project independent news abroad. At home, Congress moved to cut $9 billion in previously authorized spending, including $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and about $8 billion for foreign aid. The rescissions package, demanded by Trump, passed the Senate by a narrow margin and then the House along party lines, with only a few Republicans in opposition. A separate bill and then a final package defunded PBS and NPR outright. The Federal Election Commission canceled two open meetings scheduled for July, reducing public oversight of campaign finance and election rules. NASA announced it would not publish major climate change assessments on its website, despite earlier commitments, limiting public access to scientific findings. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, after budget cuts, now had to estimate prices for 35% of its inflation basket, up from 9%, undermining the reliability of core economic data. The Commerce Department halted work on a NOAA tool to predict extreme rainfall, weakening climate preparedness. These moves did not silence all independent voices. But they narrowed the channels through which verified information could reach the public and made it easier for the administration to shape narratives without contradiction.\
\
The Epstein files controversy became a focal point where information control, intra-coalition tension, and legal maneuvering converged. DOJ and the FBI issued a memo concluding that Jeffrey Epstein had died by suicide and that no incriminating \'93client list\'94 existed, and they refused to release further materials, despite having seized more than 300 gigabytes of data that included child abuse images. MAGA influencers, who had long expected explosive revelations, reacted with anger, some calling for Bondi\'92s firing. Elon Musk amplified the backlash on his platform, asking why the promised files had not been released. House Republicans on the Rules Committee twice blocked Democratic amendments to force disclosure, even as Speaker Mike Johnson publicly called for the files to be released and for Bondi to explain herself. Democrats demanded hearings with Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel; Senator Ron Wyden pressed for access to suspicious activity reports on Epstein\'92s financial network. Wired reported that nearly three minutes were missing from the \'93full raw\'94 surveillance video of Epstein\'92s cell. In response to mounting pressure, DOJ filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts with redactions, and Trump ordered Bondi to release grand jury testimony, a partial climbdown from his earlier dismissal of the issue as a \'93hoax.\'94 At the same time, Trump filed a multibillion-dollar libel suit against the Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch over a story about a \'93bawdy\'94 letter to Epstein, and Representative Randy Fine moved to end the House\'92s subscription to the Journal. The Democracy Clock read this as a dual movement. Transparency laws were weakened in practice, even as selective disclosures were used to manage anger, and civil courts were deployed as weapons against critical media.\
\
The week\'92s economic and foreign policy moves reinforced the sense of a state serving narrow interests under a banner of national strength. Trump announced 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico, far above earlier levels, prompting threats of retaliation and contributing to a 0.3% rise in the consumer price index in June, with inflation at 2.7%. A separate 17% tariff on Mexican tomatoes, which supply half the U.S. market, raised food prices. At the same time, the administration reversed export controls on AI chips and chip design software, allowing major firms to resume sales to China, and lifted key restrictions on technology exports that had been meant to slow Beijing\'92s military and AI advances. Tariffs were imposed on allies like Japan, Europe, and South Korea, straining the alliance system, even as weapons sales to Taiwan and new arms shipments to Ukraine were announced, along with threats of 100% \'93secondary sanctions\'94 on countries trading with Russia. The State Department ordered the destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of high-nutrition biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, citing fears that aid might benefit terrorists; the food, bought with $800,000 in taxpayer funds, would now be incinerated at additional cost. USAID cuts had left the supplies in storage. These choices\'97punishing allies with tariffs, easing China\'92s tech access, burning food for children, and purging diplomats\'97did not form a coherent strategy. But they did share a pattern: economic and foreign tools were used in ways that served short-term political narratives and private entanglements, not a stable, rules-based order.\
\
Crony capitalism and conflicts of interest moved from background concern to open practice. The Trump Organization lifted its earlier self-imposed ban on foreign deals and announced Trump Tower Bucharest in partnership with a Romanian developer under corruption investigation, alongside new projects in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These ventures depended on permits from foreign governments that also sought U.S. policy favors, such as visa waivers and military basing. CBS reported that Trump\'92s presidential library would receive up to $63 million from settlements in lawsuits against major media and tech firms, raising questions about whether litigation was being used not only to chill speech but to fund a personal institution. Former Congressman Alex Mooney appeared to be skirting lobbying bans by working as a \'93consultant\'94 for a group he would help influence Congress, and an ethics report detailed his acceptance of impermissible gifts and misuse of official resources, with no action taken before he left office. HUD prepared to terminate seven major investigations into housing discrimination and segregation. The IRS moved to kill its free Direct File tax tool after meetings with tax software lobbyists. These episodes advanced the traits that mark a captured political economy: policy driven by elite lobbying, wealth buying not just access but law, and crony capitalism becoming indistinguishable from governance.\
\
Amid these trends, there were pockets of resistance and repair. Federal courts temporarily blocked the administration from ending Temporary Protected Status for nearly 12,000 Afghans, from banning 80 vetted refugees under a presidential proclamation, and from transferring an Ohio imam out of state before his bond hearing. A federal judge ordered the administration to provide documents and testimony about a cost-cutting \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 to a watchdog group, enforcing transparency. In Louisiana, a lookback law allowing survivors of clergy abuse to sue regardless of when the abuse occurred survived a church challenge, and the New Orleans archdiocese filed a settlement plan that included a public archive of files on credibly accused clergy. A federal judge dismissed Trump\'92s $50 million suit against Bob Woodward over interview tapes, affirming protections for journalistic work. In Congress, Senator Cory Booker introduced a bill to let individuals sue pesticide makers despite state liability shields; some Republicans joined Democrats in blocking the renaming of Army bases back to Confederate figures; and a bipartisan group of House members co-sponsored a bill to release the Epstein files. Civil society, too, showed life. Indivisible trained organizers under the banner \'93One Million Rising,\'94 and more than 1,500 protests honored John Lewis\'92s legacy of \'93good trouble,\'94 linking voting rights, dignity, and the Epstein controversy. Baltimore\'92s community-based violence reduction programs, youth engagement strategy, and school-based interventions offered a different model of public safety rooted in support rather than force. These efforts did not reverse the week\'92s structural shifts, but they kept alive alternative logics of power.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 26, several scheduled or ongoing processes carried clear implications for the Democracy Clock. The federal trial over North Carolina\'92s redistricting maps, with final submissions due in early August, would decide whether racially dilutive lines must be redrawn. The class-action suits over courthouse arrests and FEMA grant cuts would test whether courts would enforce due process and federal obligations in the face of executive resistance. The Senate\'92s consideration of Emil Bove\'92s nomination to the Third Circuit, after a Judiciary Committee vote that advanced him despite whistleblower allegations and a Democratic walkout, would show how far judicial appointments could be driven by loyalty over law. The rescissions package cutting public broadcasting and foreign aid, already passed by both chambers, awaited the president\'92s signature. The DOJ\'92s motion to unseal Epstein grand jury transcripts, if granted, could either deepen or dispel public distrust, depending on how fully and fairly the materials were released. And the implementation of Schedule G, still in its early stages, would determine how many positions across the government would be converted into at-will political roles.\
\
By the close of Week 26, with the Democracy Clock at 7:58 p.m., the hour had not leapt forward, but the walls of the democratic room had moved inward. Executive power operated with fewer effective checks, as courts and Congress blessed layoffs, rescissions, and appointments that favored loyalty over independence. The civil service was being hollowed out and repopulated with political actors. Immigration enforcement, backed by new data-sharing and surveillance tools, normalized a tiered system of rights and due process. Information channels that once anchored public debate\'97public broadcasting, climate science, economic statistics, election oversight\'97were thinned or redirected. Law, in the hands of the Justice Department and allied courts, was increasingly a tool to shield allies, intimidate critics, and manage narratives, rather than a neutral frame. Yet the week also showed that resistance had not vanished. Judges issued restraining orders, lawmakers demanded hearings, protesters filled streets, and local programs modeled a different kind of safety and care.\
\
The significance of this week lies in how much of the new order moved from improvisation to structure. Schedule G, Medicaid and IRS data pipelines to ICE, the Supreme Court\'92s emergency stay on Education layoffs, the defunding of PBS and NPR, the dismantling of USAGM, and the VA\'92s rollback of anti-discrimination protections are not easily undone. They change the default settings of government. Future leaders who wish to restore a more balanced democracy will not only have to reverse policies; they will have to rebuild institutions that have been bent to serve a narrower conception of who counts and what truth is. At 7:58 p.m., there is still time on the Democracy Clock, but each week like this one makes the work of turning back more demanding and the cost of delay higher.\
