\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 32 shows an authoritarian project advancing through structure rather than spectacle. The Democracy Clock\'92s public time stayed at 7:58 p.m., yet the internal gears moved forward by a tenth of a minute as the executive tightened control over health, labor, cities, and memory. At CDC, a Senate-confirmed director was fired for resisting reckless vaccine policy, senior experts resigned, and an unqualified loyalist took charge, while advisory bodies at FDA were quietly thinned. FEMA whistleblowers were sidelined, and a Federal Reserve governor was targeted for removal, signaling that expertise and legal protections now yield to loyalty. National Guard deployments and ICE operations turned Washington, Chicago, and other cities into stages for federal dominance, even as gerrymanders in Texas and Missouri locked in partisan advantage. Sweeping rollbacks of wages and collective bargaining rights weakened millions of workers. Courts and civil society won scattered victories on maps, detention, and elections, but the net effect was a democracy less able to correct its course.\
