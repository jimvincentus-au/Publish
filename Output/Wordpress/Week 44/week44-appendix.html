<h1>Week 44 Appendix: Belonging Redrawn by Force</h1>
<p><em>Immigration raids, anti-trans decrees, and secrecy fights hardened stratified citizenship while Congress and courts mounted partial, fragile checks on executive power.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with immigration crackdowns, anti-trans executive orders, and politicized law enforcement all pointing toward a governing model that treats law as a weapon rather than a limit. Operation Charlotte’s Web and related ICE/Border Patrol deployments exemplify federal power used to intimidate disfavored communities and defy local authorities, directly eroding civil liberties and federalism. Simultaneously, a sweeping suite of anti-trans policies—banning military service, stripping data and documentation, constraining healthcare, housing, prisons, and education—formalizes a stratified citizenship regime. The justice system is bent toward retaliation and impunity: politicized prosecutions (Comey), indulgent settlements and pardons (Flynn, January 6 rioter, Charles Scott), and security-state favoritism inside the FBI. Yet Congress briefly asserts itself through near-unanimous passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act and a bipartisan move to restore federal union rights, even as Trump and DOJ maneuver to nullify that transparency. Foreign and economic policy are tightly interwoven with crony capitalism and Saudi-linked self-dealing, while Trump escalates rhetoric to calling for execution of lawmakers, normalizing eliminationist language against political opponents.</p>
