The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Trump administration quickly labeled the incident as self-defense, claiming Good attempted to run over agents with her vehicle. However, local officials, including Mayor Jacob Frey, have challenged this narrative, calling it \"bullshit\" and demanding ICE leave the city. Video footage reviewed by Reuters suggests Good's vehicle was maneuvering away from agents when shots were fired, casting doubt on the federal account. The FBI and state authorities are investigating, but the full evidence record has not been released to the public.",

The crackdown is partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. The operation has led to increased detention levels, with ICE facilities operating beyond capacity, contributing to severe overcrowding and deteriorating conditions.",
