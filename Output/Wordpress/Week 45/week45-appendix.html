<h1>Week 45 Appendix: Law as Sorting Mechanism</h1>
<p><em>A week of static clock hands but deepening habits, as law, borders, and information are used to decide who counts and who may speak.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic erosion, with converging pressures on rule of law, civil-military norms, immigration-based stratification of citizenship, and foreign-policy capture. The Trump administration’s use of the Justice Department and military stands out: politicized prosecutions and purges at DOJ, broad election-related pardons, threats of military tribunals for opponents, and OLC rationalization of lethal force and boat strikes without Congress all deepen traits 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 53. Immigration policy is weaponized as a core authoritarian tool—TPS terminations, refugee and green-card reviews, child detentions, and threats to de‑naturalize citizens entrench stratified citizenship (trait 47) and normalize law as a weapon. Abroad, the Ukraine “peace” plan, coordination with Russian officials, deference to Xi on Taiwan, and Venezuela posture show foreign influence welcomed when it serves regime interests (trait 10) and a turn away from liberal-democratic alliances. Information manipulation is systemic: cancellation of GDP data, CDC science distortion, false Ukraine deal leaks, and threats to media licenses reinforce traits 39, 52, and 60. Countervailing forces—federal courts sanctioning Trump, blocking Texas maps, protecting due process, and ordering transparency in the Epstein files—provide notable but comparatively modest democratic repair.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>

<li>President Trump met with New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani after previously threatening to withhold funds: Trump’s cordial Oval Office meeting with Mamdani, following earlier threats to cut funds if he were elected, illustrated how federal resources can be used as leverage over local officials and then withdrawn for strategic political repositioning.

(2025-11-24)</li>
<li>Department of Justice shifted voting rights enforcement to align with Trump’s electoral agenda: DOJ’s voting section, now understaffed and backing GOP-favoring maps while opposing Democratic ones, repurposed federal voting enforcement to serve partisan mapmaking rather than neutral protection of equal representation.
