Week 32 of Trump’s second term brought no single rupture, but a thick accumulation of changes that left the democratic frame more brittle. The administration launched a sweeping assault on labor protections, targeting childcare and home care workers, disabled employees, and federal contractors while attempting mass union‑busting in the civil service. At the same time, federal power was turned aggressively against disfavored jurisdictions: Washington, D.C. was placed under an expanded “crime emergency,” National Guard deployments and immigration crackdowns spread fear, and plans advanced to send troops into Chicago and Baltimore over local objections. Law enforcement and courts were used to harass critics and shield allies, from politicized investigations of former officials to leniency and secrecy in Epstein‑related matters. The CDC and Federal Reserve faced direct political interference, with expert leaders fired or threatened and loyalists installed. Gerrymanders and a draft order against mail‑in voting tightened partisan control of elections. Protests, court rulings, and special elections offered pockets of resistance, but the Democracy Clock still moved from 11:17 to 11:18 p.m.
