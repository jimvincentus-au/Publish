Week 52 centers on Minnesota, where Operation Metro Surge turned Minneapolis–St. Paul into something close to occupied territory. Thousands of ICE and DHS agents conducted door‑to‑door raids, mass detentions, and lethal enforcement, culminating in the killing of U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good. The Justice Department framed her death as an assault on a federal officer, blocked civil‑rights scrutiny, and saw senior civil‑rights officials and prosecutors resign rather than ratify impunity. Parallel moves targeted critics: the FBI raided a Washington Post reporter’s home, DOJ opened probes into lawmakers who warned troops against illegal orders, and prosecutors threatened the Federal Reserve chair while ignoring transparency laws around Epstein files. Abroad and at home, Trump seized Venezuelan oil revenues, wielded global tariffs, and withheld health subsidies, blending emergency powers with patronage. States, courts, and protesters mounted significant but fragmented resistance, even as the Democracy Clock inched from 8:11 to 8:12 p.m., registering a dense, incremental deepening of executive dominance, security‑force alignment, and information control.
