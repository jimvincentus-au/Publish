<h1>Week 17 Appendix: Citizenship as Leverage</h1>
<p><em>A week of near-static clock time in which law, borders, and money were quietly retooled to sort belonging and shield power from consequence.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian pressure across multiple pillars of U.S. democracy. The most acute threats cluster around rule of law, immigration, and foreign influence. The administration openly toys with suspending habeas corpus and due process for migrants, weaponizes the Alien Enemies Act, and directs DOJ to &quot;name and shame&quot; political opponents while preparing investigations of prosecutors who charged Trump. Immigration enforcement is fused with political repression: ICE misleads courts to raid student activists, DHS floats classifying migrants as an &quot;invasion,&quot; and National Guard deployment for immigration is explored. Simultaneously, a dense web of foreign money and arms deals—Qatar’s $400m jet, a $5.5bn Trump-branded golf project, massive Saudi and Qatari arms packages, and sanctions relief for Syria tied to Trump-branded real estate—pushes emoluments and crony capitalism to the foreground. Civil society and media are squeezed through mass firings at Voice of America, exclusion of reporters from Air Force One, campus crackdowns, and new tools to strip nonprofits’ tax status. Courts and some states push back on deportations, health cuts, and grant retaliation, but the net structural pressure is strongly negative.</p>
