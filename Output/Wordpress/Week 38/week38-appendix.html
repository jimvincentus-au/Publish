<h1>Week 38 Appendix: Shutdown as Weaponry</h1>
<p><em>In a week of near-still clock hands, immigration crackdowns, shutdown tactics, and politicized prosecutions quietly tightened executive power and thinned democratic constraint.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-pressure week centered on militarized domestic governance, weaponization of federal law enforcement, and deliberate institutional sabotage under cover of a shutdown and external crises. The Trump administration pushed to normalize troop deployments into Democratic-led cities (Portland, Chicago, Illinois generally) over state objections, with explicit Insurrection Act talk and a DOJ memo justifying lethal strikes on drug boats. Courts repeatedly intervened to block or narrow these deployments, but appeals and partial green lights show a live tug-of-war over civil–military boundaries. Simultaneously, the Justice Department was openly repurposed against perceived enemies: firing and sidelining career prosecutors and FBI agents, indicting James Comey and New York AG Letitia James after Trump’s demands, stripping the public integrity section, and stalling or burying corruption probes (Tom Homan, Epstein files). Congress was paralyzed by a shutdown that the White House treats as leverage to gut Democratic-leaning programs and federal workers’ protections, while House leaders refused to seat a duly elected member to block transparency on Epstein. Information control and disinformation—from vaccine-autism lies to attacks on media and academics—reinforced a strategy of chaos that overwhelms accountability even as civil society, state officials, and some judges mount visible resistance.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump ordered a military strike on a boat off Venezuela under a disputed armed-conflict theory: By framing drug cartels as armed enemies to justify a strike on a Venezuelan boat, the president stretched war powers in ways that bypass normal congressional and legal checks on the use of force.

<li>President Trump called for the removal of New York Attorney General Letitia James on social media: A former president’s public demand to oust a sitting state attorney general for pursuing cases against him signaled willingness to delegitimize independent law enforcement to protect personal interests.

<li>President Trump ordered deployment of Illinois National Guard troops to protect federal facilities: Authorizing state Guard units for domestic law-enforcement roles expanded presidential control over military resources inside the country, testing limits on federal use of force in civilian settings. (2025-10-06)</li>

</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed and effectively blocked the swearing-in of Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva: Postponing a duly elected member’s swearing-in, apparently to affect votes on releasing Epstein-related files, used procedural control of membership to shape oversight and transparency outcomes.

(2025-10-07)</li>
<li>Illinois and Chicago officials sued the Trump administration to block National Guard deployments to the city: The joint lawsuit framed federal troop deployments as part of a declared “war” on the state, using courts to contest executive encroachment on local policing authority.
