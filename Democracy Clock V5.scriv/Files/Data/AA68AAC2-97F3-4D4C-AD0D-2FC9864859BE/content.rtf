\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 22 unfolds as a tightening, not a rupture. The Democracy Clock\'92s face stays at 7:52 p.m., but 30 traits edge further toward authoritarianism, especially where law, force, and information converge. The presidency federalizes Guard units over California\'92s objection, deploys Marines against immigration protests, and threatens disaster aid to punish disfavored states. Immigration raids are redirected toward \'93Democrat Power Centers,\'94 while a Palestinian activist, a journalist, and New York\'92s comptroller are swept into detention or arrest, illustrating law as a weapon rather than a limit. Simultaneously, birthright citizenship is attacked, visas become ideological filters, and a $5 million \'93Trump Card\'94 offers residency for the wealthy. Regulatory agencies and courts deliver favors to GEO Group, crypto allies, and fossil fuel interests, blurring governance with crony capitalism. Voice of America is gutted, Juneteenth and civil-rights symbols are dimmed, and political violence claims a Minnesota legislator. Against this consolidation, courts, Congress, and massive \'93No Kings\'94 protests mount visible but embattled resistance.\
