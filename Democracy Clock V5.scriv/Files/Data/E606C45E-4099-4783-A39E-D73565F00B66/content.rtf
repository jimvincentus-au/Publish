\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 35 Appendix: Ordinary Emergency as Method\
\
This was an exceptionally heavy week of authoritarian pressure across nearly every safeguard of U.S. democracy. The Trump administration used executive power aggressively against courts, the Fed, cities, immigrants, media, and science agencies, while Congress and the courts only partially resisted. Immigration and law-enforcement policy were weaponized: warrantless raids, solitary confinement, reopening Angola\'92s \'91Camp J\'92 for ICE, mass arrests of lawful workers, and criminalization of healthcare workers and protesters. Simultaneously, RFK Jr.\'92s purge of vaccine institutions and EPA\'92s move to rescind the endangerment finding signaled a coordinated assault on science-based governance. Media freedom took a sharp hit: FCC threats, Kimmel\'92s suspension, Sinclair/Nexstar programming shifts, DOJ defamation suits, and removal of a far\uc0\u8209 right violence study all entrenched a pro\u8209 regime information environment. New immigration and H\u8209 1B policies stratified legal status by wealth and ideology, while the \'93Gold Card\'94 visa and UAE chip/crypto deals deepened crony capitalism. There were pockets of resistance\'97federal courts blocking some deportations and the Fed firing, congressional investigations, state-level vaccine guidance\'97but these were outweighed by systemic moves toward rule-by-decree, criminalization of dissent, and curated memory.\
