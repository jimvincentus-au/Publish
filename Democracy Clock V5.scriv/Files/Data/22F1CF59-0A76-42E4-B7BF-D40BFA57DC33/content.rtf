\f0\fs26 \cf0 Metadata for Week 25\
====================\
\
Title\
-----\
Law as Central Command\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A Supreme Court immunity ruling and militarized immigration raids fused law, bureaucracy, and force into a single project of executive-centered rule.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
The shell of democracy remained, but Week 25 showed how quickly law, bureaucracy, and armed power can be rewired to answer a single center.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 25 marked a structural tightening of Trump\'92s second term, as legal doctrine, administrative power, and armed force converged around the presidency. The Supreme Court granted sweeping criminal immunity for presidential acts, narrowed nationwide injunctions, and cleared the way for mass federal layoffs, enabling the administration\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 purge. Simultaneously, Trump wielded emergency tariffs, unilateral war-making, and limits on congressional access to classified information to sideline the legislature and professional expertise. Immigration became the regime\'92s laboratory: TPS terminations, third-country deportations, dismantled DHS watchdog offices, and militarized raids in California and Florida turned enforcement into a system of fear with shrinking oversight. A regressive reconciliation bill locked in tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing Medicaid and public goods, even as FEMA, the National Weather Service, and health research agencies were hollowed out. Pockets of resistance\'97court blocks on birthright-citizenship changes, Planned Parenthood funding cuts, and Florida\'92s immigration law\'97survived, but the Democracy Clock still moved 4.9 minutes closer to midnight, to 7:57 p.m.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
Supreme Court immunity, emergency tariffs, civil-service purges, and militarized immigration raids fused law and force around the presidency, hollowing public institutions even as scattered courts and advocates fought rear-guard actions.\

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock moved from 7:52 p.m. to 7:57 p.m., a shift of 4.9 minutes toward midnight. This represents an acute week of democratic erosion, driven by Supreme Court immunity rulings, civil-service purges, and the fusion of immigration enforcement with militarized domestic control.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a gavel cracked down over a pocket Constitution, a tarnished presidential seal, a stack of redacted legal files labeled with generic case numbers, and a small alarm clock reading 7:57. In the background, a blurred barbed-wire fence and a pair of handcuffs suggest detention. Warm but ominous lighting, painterly realism, no text, no real-world faces.", "wide": "A dusk cityscape of Washington, D.C., seen from above, with the Capitol dome in shadow and the Supreme Court and White House brightly lit, connected by glowing circuitry lines. National Guard trucks and armored vehicles move through a downtown street where protesters are hemmed behind metal barricades. Storm clouds gather on the horizon, and a large, faint clock face overlays the sky, its hands inching toward midnight. Painterly, realistic style, moody, high detail, no recognizable politicians, no text."\}\
