\f0\fs26 \cf0 Metadata for Week 18\
====================\
\
Title\
-----\
Budgets as Border Walls\
\
Subtitle\
--------\
A reconciliation megabill, weaponized immigration, and captured agencies hardwire inequality and stratified citizenship even as courts briefly hold the line.\
\
Tagline / Hook\
-------------\
The hands do not move, but budgets, borders, and courts are quietly rewired to serve friends of power and sort everyone else.\
\
Synopses\
--------\
Long Synopsis:\
Week 18 is a study in consolidation rather than shock. The House rams through a sprawling reconciliation package that locks in high-end tax cuts, slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and green incentives, and quietly funds mass deportation infrastructure while trimming courts\'92 contempt powers. Immigration policy becomes an explicit sorting mechanism: TPS for Venezuelans is terminated, visas are revoked en masse, refugees are rendered stateless, and white South Africans are fast-tracked, even as judges temporarily block some deportations and the dismantling of key agencies. The Supreme Court\'92s emergency orders advance a unitary executive theory over independent boards, while DOJ is repurposed to investigate perceived enemies and abandon civil-rights enforcement. Universities, journalists, and civil servants face direct retaliation, even as courts and new legal-defense networks push back. Crony capitalism is normalized through a Qatari jet and a crypto pay-to-play dinner. The Democracy Clock stays at 7:51 p.m., not from safety, but because resistance narrowly matches the week\'92s layered damage.\
\
Short Synopsis:\
A vast House megabill, weaponized immigration, and captured agencies deepen inequality and stratified citizenship, while fragmented judicial pushback keeps the Democracy Clock frozen at 7:51 p.m.\'97for now.\

- clock_time_reference: The Democracy Clock remains at 7:51 p.m., unchanged from Week 17 (471.2 minutes before and after). This apparent stillness masks a week in which aggressive structural erosion\'97through the megabill, immigration enforcement, and agency capture\'97was narrowly counterbalanced by judicial injunctions and pockets of civic resistance, producing consolidation rather than a visible lurch toward midnight.\
- image_prompts: \{"square": "A symbolic still life on a heavy wooden desk: a judge\'92s gavel resting on a stack of immigration files stamped \\"TPS\\" and \\"Deportation\\", a torn SNAP benefits card, a gold-plated pen beside a crypto coin and a miniature private jet model. Behind them, a small American flag is partially obscured by a thick chain, and a desk clock frozen at 7:51. Painterly, realistic style with rich textures and subdued, ominous lighting.", "wide": "A dusk-lit Capitol building seen from a distance, its windows glowing while a massive concrete wall and barbed wire slowly rise from the steps, morphing into spreadsheets and legal documents. In the foreground, a diverse crowd stands behind a chain-link fence, some holding court injunction papers that glow faintly. A large, slightly blurred clock hovers in the sky stuck at 7:51, with shadows lengthening across shuttered federal agency buildings and a distant airport runway where a gleaming jumbo jet sits. Painterly, realistic style, moody, with strong contrasts between warm interior light and encroaching darkness."\}\
