\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 30 of Trump\'92s second term turned security into a master key for unlocking doors once guarded by local autonomy, neutral law, and shared facts. The administration declared a dubious crime emergency in Washington, D.C., federalized the city\'92s police, and deployed the National Guard and federal agents, testing how far emergency language could stretch. Legal and political pushback forced a partial retreat, but the precedent of seizing a city\'92s police on thin grounds remained. Parallel moves deepened the pattern: harsh immigration raids, threats against sanctuary cities, and terrorism designations aimed at Venezuelans; politicized purges at the CFPB, VA, and Bureau of Labor Statistics; and Christian\uc0\u8209 nationalist signaling inside the Pentagon. Museums, monuments, and data agencies were pulled toward a single narrative of American greatness and regime success. Courts, states, and civil society won scattered victories on transparency, DEI, and protest rights, but the structural tilt favored centralized, partisan control. The Democracy Clock advanced only 0.1 minutes, yet the machinery of self\u8209 government emerged more tightly constrained.\
