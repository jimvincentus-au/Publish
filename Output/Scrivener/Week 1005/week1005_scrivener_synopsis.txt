This chapter steps back from specific events to examine the ethical substructure that makes democratic self-government possible. It argues that the Constitution assumes, but does not codify, a baseline of character in public life: leaders who practice restraint, institutions that enforce consequences, and citizens who refuse to reward misconduct. Over time, professionalized politics, permanent parties, and polarized media have weakened those cultural guardrails, allowing ethical breaches to be absorbed as partisan tactics rather than punished as civic failures. The chapter defines six core traits—character, ethics, restraint, truthfulness, good faith, and stewardship—as minimum operating requirements, not heroic virtues. When leaders, institutions, or citizens abandon these traits, the formal machinery of democracy can continue while its capacity for self-correction erodes. In the Democracy Clock model, this “moral floor” is the final structural pillar: without it, promises, imperatives, and deliverables cannot reliably translate into legitimate, accountable power.
