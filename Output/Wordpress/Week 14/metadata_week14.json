    "square": "A 1:1 symbolic still life: a stack of worn law books and a university seal folder on a wooden desk, bound together by a heavy leather belt stamped with an eagle emblem. Beside them lies a revoked passport and a student ID card, partially covered by a redacted government memo. A small brass desk clock frozen at 7:57 sits in the background, its face reflecting a faint barbed-wire pattern. The lighting is dramatic and realistic, emphasizing textures of paper, metal, and leather, evoking themes of control, exclusion, and constrained knowledge.",
    "wide": "A dusk-lit 16:9 scene of a grand neoclassical courthouse and an ivy-covered university quad facing each other across a city street, both partially shrouded in scaffolding and caution tape. In the foreground, a large, old-fashioned clock reads 7:57, its glass cracked but still running. Federal office towers loom behind, some windows glowing with harsh fluorescent light, others dark. Small groups of protesters with indistinct signs gather near barricades, while suited figures slip through side doors. The atmosphere is tense and painterly, with muted colors and long shadows suggesting institutional strain and contested authority."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 14 of Trump\u2019s second term unfolded as a dense, structural tightening rather than a single dramatic break. The Democracy Clock barely moved, from 476.7 to 476.9 minutes, holding at 7:57 p.m., yet executive power pressed harder against legal and institutional limits. The White House signaled defiance of a unanimous Supreme Court order in the Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda deportation case, even as courts paused Venezuelan removals, blocked sanctuary-city funding threats, and restored Voice of America. Immigration enforcement grew harsher and less accountable, with wrongful citizen detentions, closure of detention oversight offices, and identity-based targeting of students and activists. Universities became central leverage points: billions in grants were frozen, tax status threatened, accreditation rules rewritten, and immigration tools deployed to chill protest. Simultaneously, civil-rights enforcement was narrowed through elimination of disparate-impact liability and deep Medicaid and disability cuts, while agencies like Interior, State, and DOGE were centralized, captured, or outsourced. Courts, state laws, and mass protests offered pockets of resistance, but the week\u2019s net effect was to normalize a presidency that treats law as optional and institutions as instruments.",
