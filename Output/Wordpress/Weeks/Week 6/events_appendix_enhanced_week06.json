This group, composed of various Justice Department offices, is tasked with reviewing potential abuses of the criminal justice system over the past four years. The group will report its findings to Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, which raises concerns about the Justice Department's independence due to its direct reporting line to the White House. The group is also scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest, as some members have previously defended Trump or been involved in adversarial litigation against the Biden administration.",

These ordinances, from Carbondale, Illinois, and Englewood, New Jersey, were argued by anti-abortion activists to violate the First Amendment's free speech protections. The activists sought to overturn the 2000 Hill v. Colorado ruling, which upheld similar laws. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas expressed a desire to revisit the Hill decision, but the court did not provide reasons for declining the cases. The ordinances remain in effect, maintaining restrictions on protest activities near clinics.",

This action contravenes the court order and affects critical research funding, including studies on cancer and heart disease.

Sun, who was charged in March 2023 with marketing unregistered securities and manipulating the market for a crypto token, had recently invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial (WLF), a venture backed by Donald Trump. This investment resulted in over $50 million being funneled to Trump. The SEC and Sun filed a joint request for a 60-day stay in the case to explore a potential resolution, which was granted by a federal judge.
