Week 29 of Trump’s second term shows a democracy whose formal structures still stand while their contents are steadily replaced. The Justice Department opened a treason grand jury against Obama-era officials and targeted New York Attorney General Letitia James, even as appeals courts blunted consequences for unlawful deportations. Law became a weapon against those who had constrained the president. Independent information was punished: the commissioner of labor statistics was fired after weak jobs numbers, crime data showing steep declines was ignored, and White House transcripts and even constitutional text briefly vanished from official sites. Universities were coerced through frozen funds, monitors, and an admissions-data order that tied federal money to ideological compliance. In Texas and Indiana, redistricting fights fused gerrymandering with law-enforcement threats. Immigration policy expanded detention and private contracts while rights abuses mounted. Public resources, from Medicare to a new White House ballroom and a restored Confederate memorial, were redirected toward donors, symbolism, and crony profit. The Democracy Clock moved from 11:09 to 11:13 p.m., reflecting dense, systemic erosion rather than a single break.
