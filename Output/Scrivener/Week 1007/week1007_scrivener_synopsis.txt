This chapter steps back from any single week’s headlines to map the recurring patterns by which democracies decay. It introduces sixty traits, grouped into five categories—Power and Authority; Institutions and Governance; Economic Structure; Civil Rights and Dissent; and Information, Memory, and Manipulation—that together describe how self-government is hollowed out from within. Each trait is defined as a diagnostic, not a prophecy: executives ruling without oversight, courts captured by donors, economies redesigned for extraction, dissent criminalized, and public memory curated by power. Historical examples from Italy, the Philippines, Hungary, Russia, Chile, South Africa, Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa, the Soviet Union, China, and Turkey show how these traits cluster and reinforce one another. The chapter argues that a single breach may be survivable, but clusters of traits signal a deeper transformation, where democracy persists in name while its substance quietly disappears.
