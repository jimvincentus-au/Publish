\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 24 is a week of consolidation rather than rupture. Trump\'92s \'93One Big Beautiful Bill\'94 moves from Senate floor to July 4 signing, using reconciliation abuses and procedural hardball to extend regressive tax cuts, slash Medicaid, SNAP, Planned Parenthood, and clean energy, and pour money into ICE, detention, border walls, and defense contractors. The result is a statutory architecture that treats inequality as design, not accident, and shifts risk onto the public while privatizing profit. The Supreme Court narrows nationwide injunctions and allows partial enforcement of a birthright citizenship order, further weakening judicial checks and hardening a tiered citizenship regime. Immigration enforcement expands through new detention complexes, lethal neglect, and arrests of journalists and officials engaged in oversight. Agencies like FCC, Labor, EPA, CDC, and DOJ are steered toward donors and loyalists. Resistance persists in lawsuits and lower-court rulings, but within a shrinking field. The Democracy Clock stays at 7:52 p.m., not from safety, but because the chosen model is now being built out in law and practice.\
