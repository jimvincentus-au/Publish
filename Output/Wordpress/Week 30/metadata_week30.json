Beside it, a tarnished police badge, a pair of dog tags, and a small Confederate-style statue share space with a redacted statistical report and a museum exhibit label. A single overhead light casts sharp shadows, evoking the quiet repurposing of law, security, and memory.",
    "wide": "A dusk view of Washington, D.C., in painterly realism: the Capitol dome and nearby federal buildings under a hazy sky, streets below filled with overlapping layers of police cruisers, National Guard vehicles, and immigration detention buses. In the foreground, a large, slightly blurred clock reads just after 8 p.m., its glass cracked. Protesters with signs are penned behind metal barricades, while suited officials confer on a raised platform. The overall mood is tense and controlled, with strong contrasts of light and shadow suggesting creeping emergency rule."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 30 of Trump\u2019s second term turned Washington, D.C. into a laboratory for emergency rule. The White House declared a crime emergency in a city with falling violence, federalized the Metropolitan Police, and openly explored overturning Home Rule, only partially retreating under lawsuits and a congressional resolution. The same logic ran through immigration, where ICE targeted long\u2011settled residents, DACA recipients, and even alleged citizen children, while the Justice Department threatened sanctuary leaders and lawyers as new private detention centers and a Florida \u201cdeportation depot\u201d expanded carceral profit. Security forces were repurposed: right\u2011wing extremism was deprioritized as Border Patrol agents appeared, rifles visible, at a Newsom event and the Pentagon was ordered to treat cartels like wartime enemies. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth advanced Christian nationalist and Lost Cause symbolism inside the military. Meanwhile, politicized appointments, mass firings, and privatization hollowed out statistical agencies, the CFPB, and veterans\u2019 care. Courts and civil society won scattered victories, but the Democracy Clock\u2019s slight internal shift captured a steady thinning of restraint.",
