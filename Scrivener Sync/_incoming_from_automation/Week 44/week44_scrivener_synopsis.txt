Week 44 unfolds under a frozen clock: 11:27 p.m., no minutes lost or gained. The stillness masks a deepening of traits already at maximum presence. A tiered citizenship regime hardens as sweeping executive orders strip federal recognition from transgender people, push them out of the military, restrict medical care, and reroute them into more dangerous shelters and prisons. Immigration raids far from the border, abusive deportations, and Texas’s terrorism label for Muslim groups extend second‑class status by identity and geography. Law is wielded as a weapon through politicized prosecutions, selective pardons, and efforts to bury the Epstein files, even as courts occasionally expose misconduct. Security forces and the civil service are bent toward partisan ends, while crony capitalism fuses Saudi business, arms sales, and domestic contracting. Dissenters, including lawmakers and journalists, are branded as traitors. Yet civil society protests, local ordinances, and rare bipartisan transparency laws show that some guardrails and voices of resistance remain.
