Week 35 of Trump’s second term records a democracy whose formal structures still stand while their purposes are steadily repurposed. The Democracy Clock moves from 11:20 p.m. to 11:22 p.m., a 1.9‑minute shift driven less by spectacle than by coordinated structural change. Law is repeatedly wielded as a weapon: RICO floated against protesters, immigration courts sidelined as protected people are deported, and prosecutors punished for refusing politicized cases. Dissent is recast as terrorism, with visa revocations, treason talk, and “antifa” branded a terrorist organization. Independent media and public health science are squeezed as the FCC menaces broadcasters, Jimmy Kimmel is pulled off air, a critical DOJ extremism study disappears, and vaccine advisory bodies are purged. Immigration enforcement becomes a domestic security theater of raids, solitary confinement, and a reopened Camp J. Courts, Congress, and some states register pockets of resistance, but they are outpaced by an executive willing to test every seam, leaving the civic room smaller and more dangerous to inhabit.
