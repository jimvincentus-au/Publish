# Week 5 Appendix: The State as Personal Instrument

*Mass firings, data seizures, and cultural erasures turned the federal government into a more personal, less accountable tool of rule in a single dense week.*

![Header image](image_wide_week5_appendix.png)

This week reads like a concentrated stress test of nearly every democratic safeguard at once. The Trump–Musk DOGE project accelerates into a de facto parallel state: mass firings across health, environmental, safety, and foreign-aid agencies; aggressive efforts to seize IRS, SSA, and education data; and court rulings that largely greenlight the purge. Executive orders centralize control over independent regulators, reinterpret legality via the unitary executive, and weaponize budget freezes and deregulation against Congress’s appropriations power. Simultaneously, the justice system is bent toward impunity for allies and pressure on critics: corruption charges against Eric Adams are dropped under political pressure, whistleblower and watchdog protections are attacked, and Kash Patel is installed to redirect the FBI’s focus. Information control intensifies through bans and lawsuits against AP, ideological cleansing of military schools and federal websites, and erasure of LGBTQ+ and Black history. Abroad, U.S. policy tilts toward Russia and China at Ukraine’s expense, with mineral-grab diplomacy and exclusionary peace talks. Civil society, unions, states, and some courts push back, but the structural pressure this week overwhelmingly entrenches authoritarian drift.

Power and Authority

1. President Trump signed an executive order empowering Elon Musk's Doge committee to shrink the federal workforce (2025-02-15): Granting a private-led committee authority over federal staffing concentrated executive power in an unelected actor and weakened normal civil service and oversight channels.

2. President Trump announced mass layoffs in federal health agencies including CDC and HHS (2025-02-15): Firing thousands of health officials, including epidemic intelligence officers, reduced state capacity to manage disease threats and increased executive leverage over a weakened bureaucracy.

3. President Trump threatened to revoke parole and Temporary Protected Status programs for Ukrainians and ordered a TPS review (2025-02-15): Threatening legal status for Ukrainians and other TPS holders used immigration powers to create insecurity for large groups whose rights depend on executive discretion.

4. President Trump denied Georgia's request to extend the deadline for federal disaster assistance applications after Hurricane Helene (2025-02-15): Refusing more time for Georgia communities to seek disaster aid showed how federal relief can be used selectively, affecting equal treatment of states and localities.

5. President Trump issued an order ending federal support for school COVID-19 vaccine mandates tied to discretionary funds (2025-02-15): Barring federal funds for schools with COVID-19 vaccine mandates shifted public health decisions toward ideological control and constrained local authorities’ ability to protect students.

6. President Trump froze federal spending in defiance of statutory program requirements (2025-02-16): Imposing an across-the-board spending freeze contrary to appropriations law undermined Congress’s power of the purse and normalized unilateral budget control.

7. President Trump oversaw mass firings of federal employees across multiple agencies under a workforce reduction initiative (2025-02-16): Sweeping dismissals at agencies like Agriculture, EPA, VA, Forest Service, HHS and others weakened neutral administration and increased political dependence among remaining staff.

8. President Trump called for the immediate closure of the Department of Education (2025-02-16): Seeking to abolish the Education Department threatened federal support for low-income and disabled students and signaled hostility to a key public institution.

9. President Trump signed an executive order appointing Elon Musk to oversee large federal workforce reductions (2025-02-11): Delegating broad downsizing authority to a private ally blurred lines between public office and private influence and accelerated politicization of the civil service.

10. President Trump declared "Gulf of America Day" and ordered the Gulf of Mexico renamed (2025-02-09): Unilaterally renaming a major body of water asserted symbolic control over national language and pressured institutions and media to adopt politically driven terminology.

11. President Trump instituted a federal spending freeze affecting disaster and other aid programs (2025-02-16): Using a freeze to halt congressionally mandated programs challenged legal limits on executive impoundment and risked withholding essential services for political or ideological reasons.

12. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to dismiss all remaining Biden-appointed US attorneys (2025-02-19): Forcing out prosecutors appointed by the prior administration consolidated presidential control over federal prosecutions and weakened norms of Justice Department independence.

13. President Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to rescind or ignore regulations deemed unconstitutional or beyond statutory authority (2025-02-19): Telling agencies to unilaterally downgrade or stop enforcing rules reinterpreted constitutional limits through the executive branch, bypassing courts and Congress.

14. President Trump issued an executive order to reduce the federal bureaucracy and shrink or terminate several entities (2025-02-19): Ordering cuts to entities like the African Development Foundation and Institute of Peace restructured public functions by decree, reducing independent policy capacity.

15. President Trump signed an executive order restricting access to federal benefits for undocumented immigrants (2025-02-19): Tightening benefit eligibility for undocumented residents used social programs as an enforcement tool and deepened stratification of rights by legal status.

16. President Trump suggested publicly that he might run for a third presidential term (2025-02-20): Questioning constitutional term limits in front of an audience normalized the idea of extending personal rule beyond established democratic constraints.

17. President Trump threatened to cut federal funding to Maine over compliance with his transgender sports ban (2025-02-21): Using federal funds to coerce a state into adopting contested social policy challenged state autonomy and targeted transgender participation in public life.

Institutions and Governance

4. Trump administration defied multiple federal court orders intended to halt contested executive actions (2025-02-15): Ignoring injunctions against policies like funding freezes and citizenship changes eroded judicial authority and the expectation that court rulings bind the executive.

5. Department of Justice leadership pressured Public Integrity Section lawyers to choose who would dismiss the Eric Adams indictment under threat of firing (2025-02-14): Forcing prosecutors to pick a colleague to drop a corruption case under duress politicized prosecutorial decisions and undermined internal ethical safeguards.

10. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission moved to dismiss six gender-identity discrimination cases citing a new sex-definition order (2025-02-16): Abandoning pending cases narrowed federal enforcement of workplace protections for transgender workers and reinterpreted civil rights law along executive lines.

11. Government employee unions filed lawsuits challenging mass federal workforce reductions as procedurally unlawful (2025-02-16): Union suits sought to enforce reduction-in-force rules and preserve due process in federal employment against rapid politically driven purges.

12. Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court to uphold firing of whistleblower watchdog Hampton Dellinger (2025-02-17): Asking the Court to validate removal of the Office of Special Counsel chief tested limits on presidential power over independent oversight bodies.

17. Joshua Fisher, Director of the Office of Administration told a court that Elon Musk is only a senior advisor without formal decision-making authority (2025-02-19): Downplaying Musk’s formal role in litigation sought to shield extensive de facto influence from constitutional scrutiny and Senate confirmation requirements.

18. Federal judge declined to issue a restraining order blocking mass federal worker firings (2025-02-19): Refusing to halt the purge allowed the administration’s restructuring of the civil service to proceed while unions were redirected to slower administrative channels.

Economic Structure

1.
