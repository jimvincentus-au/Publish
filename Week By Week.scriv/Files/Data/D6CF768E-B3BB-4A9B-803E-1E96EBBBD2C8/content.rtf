\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 32 Appendix: Emergency Powers as Routine Governance\
\
This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week, with the executive moving aggressively on three fronts: militarized control of Democratic jurisdictions, weaponization of law enforcement and regulatory power against opponents and vulnerable groups, and structural attacks on labor, public health, and electoral fairness. Plans and orders to federalize policing and deploy National Guard units in Washington, Chicago, Baltimore, and sanctuary cities, plus creation of specialized Guard units, push traits 1, 5, 9, and 11 sharply toward entrenched emergency rule. Parallel DOJ and ICE actions\'97politically targeted investigations, coercive plea tactics, opaque transfers, and retaliation against detainees and whistleblowers\'97intensify law-as-weapon dynamics (trait 4) and stratified citizenship (trait 47). The firing of CDC director Susan Monarez, installation of an unqualified loyalist, and mass resignations at CDC mark a serious blow to civil service independence and science-based governance (traits 16, 22, 53). On the socioeconomic side, nationalization-lite of Intel, deep labor rollbacks, and tariff shocks embed crony capitalism and inequality (traits 16, 35, 36, 38). Simultaneously, redistricting maneuvers, threats to mail voting, and litigation over maps escalate structural manipulation of representation (trait 45), even as a few court rulings and state-level elections show residual democratic resistance.\

\
Power and Authority\
\
1. President Trump and the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a halt to work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind offshore project (2025-08-23): The halt of a major offshore wind project used federal executive power to reshape energy policy and investment, signaling preference for political and security narratives over long-term public infrastructure planning.\
\
2. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin defended President Trump\'92s opposition to wind power projects (2025-08-23): Public defense of opposition to wind projects reinforced an executive-driven shift in national energy priorities with limited transparent policy rationale, affecting how federal power steers infrastructure choices.\
\
3. President Trump announced lawyers were drafting an executive order to eliminate mail-in balloting nationwide (2025-08-24): Planning an executive order to end mail-in voting would centralize control over election mechanics in the presidency, threatening access to the ballot and bypassing normal legislative processes.\
\
4. President Trump threatened to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over unproven mortgage fraud allegations (2025-08-24): Threatening removal of a sitting Fed governor based on contested accusations challenged the central bank\'92s independence and signaled willingness to use personal power against economic officials.\
\
5. President Trump declared a crime emergency in Washington, D.C. and assumed control of the city\'92s police (2025-08-25): Declaring a crime emergency to federalize D.C. policing expanded presidential authority over local law enforcement despite low crime data, weakening home rule and local accountability.\
\

\
10.

\
11. President Trump signed an executive order ending the de minimis tariff exemption for small packages under $800 (2025-08-29): Eliminating tariff exemptions for low-value imports by executive order shifted trade burdens onto consumers and small businesses without legislative debate, centralizing economic decision-making in the presidency.\
\
12. President Trump proposed a rule to eliminate federal minimum wage and overtime protections for childcare and home care workers (2025-08-29): Using executive rulemaking to strip wage and overtime protections from millions of care workers leveraged federal power to weaken a large, low-paid workforce\'92s bargaining position.\
\

\
14. President Trump attempted to rescind collective bargaining rights from about one million federal workers (2025-08-29): Seeking to strip union rights from a large share of the federal workforce concentrated power over employment conditions in the executive branch and weakened organized checks inside government.\
\
15. President Trump cut the minimum wage for federal contractors from $17.75 to $13.30 per hour (2025-08-29): Reducing contractor wage floors by executive action directly lowered earnings for many public-service workers, demonstrating how presidential power can reset labor standards without new legislation.\
\
16. President Trump and the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a rule banning VA doctors from performing abortions except to save a patient\'92s life (2025-08-29): The proposed VA abortion ban used executive control over veterans\'92 healthcare to sharply restrict reproductive rights for women veterans, limiting medical autonomy within a federal system.\
\

Institutions and Governance\
\
1. Texas Senate approved a redrawn congressional map expected to give Republicans up to five additional seats (2025-08-23): Passing a heavily pro-Republican map reshaped Texas\'92s congressional representation, prompting Voting Rights Act challenges over minority vote dilution and testing judicial oversight of partisan redistricting.\

\
8. Representative Andy Biggs introduced a bill to extend federal control of Washington, D.C.\'92s police for six months by default (2025-08-25): Legislation to lengthen federal takeovers of D.C. policing would normalize extended congressional and executive control over local law enforcement, weakening home rule.\

\
17.
