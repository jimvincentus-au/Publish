\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 34 traces how force, law, and institutions were quietly retooled to manage disfavored communities and jurisdictions. The Democracy Clock stayed at 7:58 p.m., but its internal measure crept 0.2 minutes closer to midnight as National Guard troops and federal agents were deployed to Washington, Chicago, and Memphis over local objections, turning ordinary crime and immigration enforcement into occasions for military-style rule. Courts enabled this shift, blessing racial profiling in immigration raids, upholding harsh reentry penalties, and greenlighting executive control over independent agencies, foreign aid, and science funding. Congress largely amplified the project, punishing Washington\'92s budget, easing confirmations, and advancing the Stop Illegal Entry Act. Immigration raids, ICE killings, and workplace sweeps deepened stratified citizenship and eroded labor protections. Simultaneously, speech around Charlie Kirk\'92s assassination was policed through firings, arrests, and doxxing campaigns, while long-standing protest and public memory were cleared or curated. State-level social policies and a handful of court rulings offered counterpoints, but could not offset the week\'92s structural consolidation.\
