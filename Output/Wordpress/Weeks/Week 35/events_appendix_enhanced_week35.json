The judge criticized the lawsuit for being filled with \"vituperation and invective\" and not adhering to federal civil procedure rules, specifically Rule 8(a), which requires a concise statement of the claim. The judge has allowed Trump 28 days to refile and amend the lawsuit. The original suit accused the defendants of spreading false and defamatory content about Trump, including claims about his television career and financial dealings.",
