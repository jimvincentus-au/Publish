<h1>Week 46 Appendix: Impunity as Operating System</h1>
<p><em>A week of layered decisions turned clemency, immigration, security, and information policy into tools of faction, family, and fear rather than public trust.</em></p>
<p>This was an exceptionally heavy week for structural democratic erosion, centered on three converging axes: weaponization of law, racialized immigration crackdown, and normalization of extrajudicial violence. The presidency and Justice Department were repeatedly used to shield elites and allies (mass pardons of corrupt officials and foreign traffickers, DOJ memo stripping PREA protections for LGBTQ+ prisoners, politicized targeting of antifa and left groups) while punishing opponents and vulnerable populations. Immigration policy shifted toward de facto group-based exclusion: nationwide pauses on asylum and Afghan processing, adjudicative holds and re-reviews for 19 “high-risk” countries, expanded travel bans, and aggressive ICE raids that ignored court orders and due process. In parallel, the Hegseth/Bradley boat-strike campaign and new Pacific strike entrenched a doctrine of permanent, legally dubious “war” on narco-traffickers, with Congress scrambling to reassert oversight after the fact. Information control and chaos politics intensified through a White House media-enemies site, suppression of economic data, and far-right-inflected national security strategy. There were pockets of resistance—federal courts blocking warrantless immigration arrests, rulings against illegal U.S. attorney appointments, and mandated Epstein-file releases—but these gains were outweighed by systemic moves toward impunity, stratified citizenship, and militarized governance.</p>
