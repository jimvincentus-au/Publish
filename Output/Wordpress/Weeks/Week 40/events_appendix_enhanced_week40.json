The state house, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to pass the map quickly. North Carolina law does not allow the Democratic governor to veto redistricting legislation, leaving critics to seek change through elections.

      "summary": "During a court hearing, attorney Kelley Henry presented evidence suggesting that Byron Black, executed in Tennessee, showed signs of cardiac activity for nearly two minutes after being declared dead. This raises questions about the state's lethal injection protocols. Black's execution, which took place in August, involved the sedative pentobarbital, but witnesses reported visible distress and pain. The ongoing litigation challenges the state's execution methods, arguing they constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The state opposes compelling execution team members to testify, citing confidentiality concerns.",
