The background fades into shadowed filing cabinets with some drawers hanging open and empty. Painterly, realistic, high detail, no text.",

In the foreground, a large clock reads 7:46, its glass cracked. Outside the windows, distant crowds and court buildings glow faintly, suggesting resistance. Painterly, realistic style, muted colors with sharp highlights on cables, servers, and locked doors."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 3 of Trump\u2019s second term advanced authoritarian consolidation without a single spectacular rupture. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:45 to 7:46 p.m., reflecting a modest numerical shift that masked deep structural change. Sweeping executive orders froze foreign aid, tested impoundment of domestic funds, and weaponized emergency tariffs, while threats to \u201ctake over\u201d Gaza, retake the Panama Canal, and strike Mexican cartels signaled a foreign policy unmoored from multilateral norms. At home, the Justice Department and FBI were purged of investigators tied to Trump and January 6, mass pardons erased accountability for the Capitol attack, and inspectors general across major agencies were fired. Musk\u2019s DOGE network gained access to Treasury payment systems, HR and small-business databases, and key IT infrastructure, embedding private actors inside the state\u2019s core plumbing. DEI protections, trans rights, asylum law, and birthright citizenship came under direct assault. Courts, unions, states, and activists won injunctions and partial rollbacks, but their victories were reactive and fragmented against a coordinated presidency\u2013oligarch nexus.",
