\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 47 Appendix: Hierarchy as Governance\
\
This was a heavy-erosion week, with the executive branch aggressively consolidating power while civil society, some courts, and a few legislatures mounted notable but limited resistance. Structurally, the most intense pressure fell on checks and balances, rule-of-law equality, and the information environment. Trump\'92s AI preemption order, the national security strategy, and threats around tariffs and independent agencies all push toward a presidency that treats Congress, states, and regulators as subordinate. Immigration and border policy hardened into a quasi-militarized regime, with new deportation aircraft, a militarized zone in California, Afghan asylum arrests, and ICE abuses, deepening stratified citizenship and normalizing security forces as tools of political theater. Simultaneously, crony capitalism and foreign-influence risks expanded through Nvidia chip sales to China and Kushner-linked sovereign wealth financing of media consolidation. On the repair side, courts blocked some overreach (National Guard in LA, unlawful prosecutor appointment, Menendez ban, Abrego rulings), Indiana Republicans rejected a Trump-backed gerrymander, Congress tied Hegseth\'92s travel budget to transparency, and states like Illinois pushed back on immigration enforcement. But these defenses were outpaced by executive and structural moves that entrench unilateralism, impunity, and elite-driven policy.\
\
Week 47 Events\
\
Power and Authority\
\
1. Trump administration announced new restrictions on Afghan and other immigration after a shooting incident (2025-12-06): The administration halted asylum decisions for Afghans and paused immigration from 19 non-European countries, using a single criminal incident to justify sweeping nationality-based limits on entry and protection.\
\
2. President Trump rescinded an ICE directive protecting non-citizen veterans from deportation (2025-12-07): By ending protections for non-citizen veterans, the administration expanded deportation powers even over people who served in the military, signaling that immigration status can override prior public service.\
\
3. Department of Veterans Affairs prepared an internal report on non-citizen employees and veterans for the administration (2025-12-07): Compiling and sharing detailed data on non-citizen VA staff and veterans positioned the executive to target a specific group of public servants for immigration enforcement, blending personnel management with coercive power.\
\
4. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that the president could order military strikes without congressional approval (2025-12-08): Hegseth\'92s defense of unilateral strikes off Venezuela framed lethal force as solely a presidential prerogative, challenging Congress\'92s war powers and weakening democratic checks on the use of violence abroad.\
\
5. Pentagon opened an investigation into Senator Mark Kelly and other lawmakers over a video on illegal orders (2025-12-08): Investigating senators for urging troops not to follow unlawful orders blurred the line between civilian oversight and sedition, potentially chilling elected officials from warning against abuses of executive power.\
\
6. President Trump pardoned Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife on federal bribery charges (2025-12-07): Pardoning a sitting congressman accused of taking foreign-linked bribes, then publicly demanding loyalty, showed executive clemency being used to shield and discipline political actors rather than reinforce impartial justice.\
\
7. President Trump fired Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter (2025-12-09): Removing the last Democratic FTC member on policy grounds challenged long-standing limits on presidential control of independent regulators, concentrating economic regulatory power in the executive branch.\
\
8. Trump administration pressured Indiana legislators to pass a partisan congressional map by threatening federal funding (2025-12-12): Threats to cut federal funds if Indiana lawmakers rejected a gerrymander used fiscal leverage to coerce a state\'92s internal redistricting decisions, undermining federalism and fair representation.\
\
9. President Trump announced he would choose the next Federal Reserve chair based on promises to cut interest rates (2025-12-09): Conditioning the Fed chair appointment on a pledge to lower rates regardless of conditions threatened the central bank\'92s independence, inviting short-term political gain at the expense of economic stability.\
\
10. President Trump publicly pressured the Supreme Court to uphold his emergency tariffs (2025-12-09): Trump\'92s insistence that the Court validate tariffs declared under economic emergency powers, coupled with vows to continue regardless, signaled disregard for judicial limits on his economic authority.\
\
11. President Trump stated he would allow health insurance subsidies to expire to reshape the ACA (2025-12-10): Supporting the lapse of ACA subsidies as a way to redirect funds and destabilize existing markets used executive influence over benefits to force structural change without broad legislative consensus.\
\
12. President Trump began a nationwide tour defending his economic record and tariff policies (2025-12-12): Launching a campaign-style tour to reframe economic discontent around his preferred narrative sought to shore up political authority by downplaying policy-driven price impacts and blaming predecessors.\
\
13. President Trump described his economy as "A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus" despite public concern (2025-12-10): Trump\'92s exaggerated self-grading on economic performance, contrary to polling and analyses, exemplified the use of personal rhetoric to override data in shaping public perceptions of his governance.\

1. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to scale back universal newborn hepatitis B vaccination recommendations (2025-12-06): Under anti-vaccine influence, ACIP\'92s move away from universal newborn hepatitis B shots risked uneven state policies and insurance coverage, weakening evidence-based public health guidance that many institutions rely on.\

\
4. Defense Department inspector general found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mishandled classified information on Signal (2025-12-06): The IG report documented Hegseth\'92s sharing of sensitive strike details over an unsecured app, exposing gaps in adherence to classification and records rules at the top of the defense hierarchy.\
\

\
12. Justice Department accepted Alina Habba\'92s resignation after courts ruled her appointment unlawful (2025-12-08): Courts\'92 rejection of Habba\'92s unconfirmed role and her shift to an advisory post highlighted tensions between legal appointment requirements and efforts to install loyalists in prosecutorial leadership.\
\
13. South Carolina court accepted a guilty plea from a clerk who mishandled evidence in the Murdaugh trial (2025-12-08): Probation for a clerk who leaked sealed photos and lied in court underscored both the system\'92s capacity to sanction misconduct and the fragility of safeguards around high-profile trials.\
