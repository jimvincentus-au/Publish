\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 48 Appendix: Law, Citizenship, and Memory as Weapons\
\
This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The Trump administration simultaneously expanded hard power (Venezuela blockade, fentanyl-as-WMD order, travel-ban expansion) and soft control over information, memory, and the civil service. Immigration enforcement and Supreme Court doctrine moved decisively toward racialized, discretionary power, while DOJ and FBI tools were redirected against perceived ideological enemies (anti-ICE activists, former intelligence officials) and away from elite accountability (Epstein files noncompliance, selective grant distribution). Regulatory agencies were aggressively captured or repurposed: EPA weakened carcinogen protections, NCAR dismantling advanced, and billions in university research funding were frozen, even as Trump\'92s own media company pursued a fusion-energy merger under his regulatory umbrella. Symbolic politics\'97biased presidential plaques, renaming the Kennedy Center, a triumphal arch\'97were funded and staged alongside material attacks on healthcare, LGBTQ+ care, and immigrant rights. Congress showed pockets of resistance (ACA subsidy discharge petition, Epstein transparency pressure), and courts occasionally checked executive overreach on immigration bonds and university funding, but these were outweighed by structural moves that entrench executive impunity, politicize the bureaucracy, and normalize emergency-style national security framing for domestic policy.\

\
Power and Authority\
\
1.

\
2.
