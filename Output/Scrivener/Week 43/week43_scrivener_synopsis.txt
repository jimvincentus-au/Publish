Week 43 unfolded as a consolidation of methods rather than a burst of new outrages. The Democracy Clock stayed at 8:11 p.m., with a slight backward drift of 0.3 minutes, reflecting a system under mounting strain but not yet in free fall. The record‑length shutdown ended on the president’s terms: agencies reopened and back pay flowed, yet core disputes over health subsidies and food assistance were deferred. Trump used the standoff to threaten unpaid air traffic controllers and stage‑manage national parks, turning public services into props. Immigration enforcement escalated from biometric tracking and abusive raids to extraterritorial detention in El Salvador, even as federal judges in Chicago and Illinois re‑imposed due‑process limits. Law and clemency were openly instrumentalized: a pardon for Binance founder CZ, politicized DOJ probes, efforts to dismantle the CFPB, and purges of housing watchdogs entrenched elite impunity. Simultaneously, the administration moved to sanitize Smithsonian exhibits and starve museums, while Congress and survivors forced a looming vote on releasing Epstein files, making transparency and public memory central battlegrounds.
