Week 23 unfolds as a study in unilateral power that does not move the Democracy Clock because the hour already assumed it. President Trump orders large‑scale airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites without congressional authorization, sidelining the War Powers Resolution and treating intelligence as malleable. The conflict abroad becomes justification for deploying marines and National Guard troops into Los Angeles to back sweeping, often lawless immigration raids that ensnare citizens, long‑time residents, and elected officials. Courts push back in individual cases, freeing detainees, blocking some deportations, and restraining budgetary retaliation, yet the Supreme Court simultaneously narrows nationwide injunctions and trims rights protections, hardening executive advantage. Public health and information systems are politicized through purges at CDC panels, deep cuts to cancer research, and the dismantling of Voice of America. Community organizing, local elections, and scattered judicial victories show resilience, but the week’s events knit together a polity where law persists while its capacity to constrain power steadily thins.
