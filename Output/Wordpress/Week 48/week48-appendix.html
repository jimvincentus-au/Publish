<h1>Week 48 Appendix: Memory As Instrument</h1>
<p><em>Law, force, and narrative tightened around the presidency, turning immigration, archives, and media into coordinated tools of control rather than constraint.</em></p>
<p>This was an acute authoritarian-consolidation week. The Trump administration simultaneously expanded hard power (Venezuela blockade, fentanyl-as-WMD order, travel-ban expansion) and soft control over information, memory, and the civil service. Immigration enforcement and Supreme Court doctrine moved decisively toward racialized, discretionary power, while DOJ and FBI tools were redirected against perceived ideological enemies (anti-ICE activists, former intelligence officials) and away from elite accountability (Epstein files noncompliance, selective grant distribution). Regulatory agencies were aggressively captured or repurposed: EPA weakened carcinogen protections, NCAR dismantling advanced, and billions in university research funding were frozen, even as Trump’s own media company pursued a fusion-energy merger under his regulatory umbrella. Symbolic politics—biased presidential plaques, renaming the Kennedy Center, a triumphal arch—were funded and staged alongside material attacks on healthcare, LGBTQ+ care, and immigrant rights. Congress showed pockets of resistance (ACA subsidy discharge petition, Epstein transparency pressure), and courts occasionally checked executive overreach on immigration bonds and university funding, but these were outweighed by structural moves that entrench executive impunity, politicize the bureaucracy, and normalize emergency-style national security framing for domestic policy.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>President Trump oversaw release of a new National Security Strategy reframing immigration and alliances: The strategy elevated immigration and civilizational conflict as security threats and revived a hard-edged Monroe Doctrine, signaling a more unilateral, identity-driven use of U.S. power abroad. (2025-12-13)</li>
<li>Trump administration froze asylum decisions and halted immigration applications for Afghans and nationals of travel-ban countries: The freeze abruptly cut off legal pathways for thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers, expanding executive control over who can access U.S. protection and status. (2025-12-13)</li>
<li>President Trump signed an executive order designating illicit fentanyl and its precursors as weapons of mass destruction: Recasting fentanyl as a WMD allowed national-security and military tools to be deployed in domestic drug enforcement, blurring lines between policing and war powers. (2025-12-15)</li>
<li>President Trump expanded the travel ban to additional African and Middle Eastern countries and Palestinian document holders: The broader ban further restricted mobility for targeted nationalities and deepened a tiered system of access to the U.S. based on origin and perceived security risk. (2025-12-16)</li>
<li>President Trump ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers and labeled the Maduro government a terrorist organization: Designating a sovereign state as a terrorist entity and blockading its oil exports escalated U.S. coercive power, stretching terrorism frameworks and risking conflict without clear congressional authorization. (2025-12-17)</li>
<li>President Trump publicly floated the idea of serving a third presidential term and had aides praise it: By entertaining a third term and amplifying legal arguments that the 22nd Amendment is unclear, the White House normalized discussion of breaching constitutional term limits. (2025-12-18)</li>
<li>President Trump announced a one-time $1,776 &quot;warrior dividend&quot; for service members funded from existing housing allowances: Repurposing congressionally appropriated housing funds into a branded cash bonus used the military payroll as a political tool while undermining long-term housing support. (2025-12-18)</li>
<li>President Trump signed executive orders reclassifying marijuana and directing expanded cannabis research: Rescheduling marijuana to facilitate research and easing access for medical uses shifted federal drug policy, modestly reducing criminalization and expanding executive influence over health regulation. (2025-12-18)</li>

<li>Trump administration moved to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research and cancel its grants: Targeting a major climate research hub for closure weakened federal scientific capacity on weather and climate risks, reducing expert input into policy decisions. (2025-12-18)</li>
<li>Trump administration announced plans to dismantle NCAR and redirect activities citing ideological concerns: Labeling core climate science work as &quot;woke&quot; and moving to shut it down signaled direct ideological control over which research the federal government supports. (2025-12-17)</li>
<li>Trump administration proposed seizing California land along the southern border for expanded military control: The proposal to convert state land into federal military zones along the border would extend military authority into civilian areas and override state preferences. (2025-12-19)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Institutions and Governance</h3>
<ol>
<li>House Republican leadership advanced a healthcare plan that omitted extension of enhanced ACA tax credits: By excluding extended marketplace subsidies, House leaders set up a lapse in support that would raise premiums for millions, using legislative design to reshape access to health coverage. (2025-12-13)</li>
<li>House Speaker Mike Johnson blocked and delayed floor votes on extending ACA premium subsidies despite majority support: Using procedural control to prevent a vote on widely supported subsidies showed how leadership can thwart majority will on core welfare policy. (2025-12-18)</li>

<li>National Trust for Historic Preservation and allied plaintiffs filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s demolition and expansion plans at historic federal buildings: The suits argued that the president bypassed required review and public input to alter major federal properties, testing legal limits on unilateral changes to shared civic spaces. (2025-12-15)</li>
<li>Department of Justice defended Trump’s White House ballroom project in court on national security grounds: Invoking security to justify bypassing preservation and public-process requirements blurred the line between legitimate protection needs and shielding presidential building projects from scrutiny.

(2025-12-18)</li>
