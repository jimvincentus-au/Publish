    "summary": "This week continued the trend of erosion in the moral floor, with significant breaches in character, ethics, restraint, and truthfulness. The administration's actions demonstrated a persistent disregard for democratic norms, particularly in the handling of immigration enforcement and the use of executive power. While there were some instances of institutional pushback, they were insufficient to counter the overarching trend of power consolidation and erosion of accountability.",

    "narrative": "The moral floor continues to deteriorate, with the executive branch increasingly treating public institutions as extensions of personal power. This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the slight inward movement of the Democracy Clock.",
