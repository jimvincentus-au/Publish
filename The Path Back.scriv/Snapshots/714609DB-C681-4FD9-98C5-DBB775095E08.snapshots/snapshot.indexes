        <Text>How to Use Your Power: The Voter as Custodian

A republic endures only when its citizens understand that power is not something held in marble buildings but something carried, quietly and steadily, in the hands of ordinary people. The 2026 election will be shaped by candidates, campaigns, and national debate, but the decisive force will be the millions of private choices made in kitchens, workplaces, community halls, and conversations between neighbors who may never think of themselves as political actors. Yet every one of them is. A self-governing people cannot escape their own agency. When democracy falters, it is citizens who must restore it; when it steadies, it is citizens who must defend it. The tools are simple, but they gain their strength from the willingness to use them.

The first act of power is the vote itself. It seems small because it is familiar, yet it is one of the few moments in public life where all citizens stand equal. A vote is not an expression of personal preference; it is a transfer of governing authority. It either strengthens the republic’s capacity to serve its people or hands more space to those who would weaken it. That is why authoritarians work to make voting feel pointless or corrupt: if voters lose faith in the vote, they lose faith in themselves. The most effective countermeasure is participation. A high-turnout election is evidence of a people refusing to surrender their role. Every eligible citizen who casts a ballot—early, by mail, or in person—adds weight to the collective decision about the country’s trajectory. To use the vote well is to remember that its purpose is not to reward personalities but to protect the future. The next Congress will decide whether democratic repair continues or stalls. Your ballot is part of that decision.

But voting is only one form of civic power, and voters often underestimate the influence they hold between elections. Conversations are one of the most potent tools available to the public. People rarely change their minds because of an argument; they change their minds because someone they trust helps them see something more clearly. When you talk with friends, family, coworkers, or members of your community, anchor the conversation in lived experience rather than ideology. Ask what has strengthened the places you share and what has weakened them. Use the language of the six deliverables because it is a common language: safety, care, education, belonging, preparation, and institutional stability touch everyone’s life. When someone expresses frustration or confusion, help them trace the line between what they are feeling and the public choices that create those conditions. This is not persuasion as pressure. It is persuasion as illumination. It helps people see what they already know but have not yet named.

Much of a voter’s influence lies in visibility. Attend town halls. Ask clear questions grounded in the real concerns of your community. Candidates respond to the concerns they hear most often, and when voters ask about the fundamentals of democracy—fair elections, functional institutions, ethical leadership—they shape what campaigns prioritize. Public events are opportunities to remind those seeking office that the country is watching not for spectacle but for seriousness. A single question asked in a quiet voice can do more to shift a campaign than a dozen online exchanges. It signals that voters are attentive to the stakes and expect candidates to meet the moment with sobriety and purpose.

Using your power also means naming harm. Not in anger, not as accusation, but as memory. Communities forget quickly because forgetting is painless. Authoritarians rely on this. They count on voters to remember feelings but forget facts. Your task is to help keep the civic record intact. When a candidate who undermined democratic norms presents themselves as a healer, recall—steadily and without rancor—what they did with the authority they once held. When a public figure misrepresents their role in past events, re-anchor the conversation in what happened, not in how it is being reframed. This is not about relitigating old fights. It is about ensuring that the future is not built on denial. A country without memory is a country without direction.

Local media and community institutions also respond to the signals voters send. When citizens demand coverage of democratic issues—voting rights, institutional integrity, local accountability—editors and producers take notice. When they reward sensationalism with clicks and silence, the civic lens narrows. Pressing local media to report on matters of public consequence is a quiet but significant form of influence. It broadens the information environment in which your neighbors make decisions. It strengthens the democratic culture on which the republic depends.

Every neighborhood has people who feel disconnected from politics, not because they do not care, but because they doubt they matter. Reconnecting those citizens to civic possibility is one of the most meaningful acts you can take. Invite them into conversations. Ask what they want for their communities. Share what you have learned about how power works and how it can be used. When people feel seen, their sense of agency grows. When they recognize patterns, they become harder to manipulate. When they understand that democracy is not distant but local, they begin to see their vote as an extension of their own dignity.

All of this—voting, conversation, memory, visibility, connection—is part of being a custodian of the republic. Custodianship is not glamorous. It is steady work, done without applause, often without recognition. But it is the backbone of a free society. Democracies are not held up by courts or Congress alone; they are held up by citizens who refuse to let the country drift toward cynicism or resignation. The repair now underway cannot last unless the people take responsibility for guarding it. Politicians can pass laws. Institutions can enforce rules. But only the public can create the conditions in which those laws and rules have life.

The closing act of this field manual is simple: the republic now depends on you. Not abstractly, not symbolically, but concretely. Your choices—your conversations, your turnout, your clarity, your memory—will determine whether the country finishes the work of repair or slides back into the habits that weakened it. Self-government places a burden on every generation, and this is ours: to steady the foundation, to protect the progress made, and to insist that democracy serve its people with honesty, dignity, and care. The power you hold is real. Use it with purpose. The future will be shaped by those who show up, who stay grounded in truth, and who choose courage over comfort. A long republic is built one election at a time, one community at a time, one citizen at a time. It is built by you.</Text>
