In Week 25, the story of Trump\'92s second term turned on the fusion of power: a presidency claiming near\uc0\u8209 impunity, a Supreme Court that increasingly enabled that claim, and a civil service and enforcement apparatus being reshaped to serve it. The week\'92s events did not unfold as isolated shocks but as a pattern in which law, bureaucracy, and force were bent toward the same end. Immigration policy became a stage for fear and spectacle, disaster response a casualty of political control, and economic tools a means of punishing enemies at home and abroad. In this setting, the Democracy Clock moved from 7:49 p.m. to 7:52 p.m., a 3.5\u8209 minute slide that captured not a single coup\u8209 like moment, but a dense run of structural blows to accountability, equal citizenship, and the state\'92s capacity to serve the public rather than the regime.\
\
The previous week had left the clock at 7:49 p.m., already well into the evening of democratic risk. By the close of Week 25 it stood at 7:52 p.m., a modest shift in appearance but a sharp one in substance. The movement reflected three converging arcs. First, the Supreme Court\'92s decisions on presidential immunity and mass federal layoffs, combined with limits on nationwide injunctions, shifted the judiciary from intermittent check to active facilitator of executive projects. Second, the administration\'92s use of immigration, disaster management, and emergency powers showed law functioning less as a limit than as a weapon, applied harshly to the vulnerable and flexibly to the powerful. Third, Congress and the bureaucracy were hollowed and repurposed: a sprawling reconciliation bill locked in upward redistribution and enforcement funding, while purges and layoffs at State, the National Weather Service, FEMA, NASA, and DHS oversight offices weakened neutral capacity and strengthened loyalist control. Against this, there were pockets of resistance\'97courts blocking the birthright\uc0\u8209 citizenship order and a Florida immigration law, legislators pushing transparency, states and civil society suing\'97but they were outweighed by the week\'92s consolidation of power.\
\
The most far\uc0\u8209 reaching development lay in the new legal shelter built around the presidency. The Supreme Court\'92s ruling in Trump v. United States that a former president enjoys \'93absolute immunity\'94 for actions within his \'93conclusive and preclusive\'94 constitutional authority, and \'93presumptive immunity\'94 for all official acts, rewrote the practical meaning of accountability at the top. In one stroke, it raised the cost and uncertainty of any future attempt to prosecute a president for abuses of office, including those that touch elections, war, or foreign affairs. That decision did not stand alone. In the same week, the Court limited nationwide injunctions, making it harder for lower courts to halt executive policies across the country, and it lifted injunctions that had frozen Trump\'92s \'93workforce optimization\'94 order and State Department layoffs. Taken together, these rulings signaled a judiciary increasingly aligned with executive and elite preferences: willing to restrain some state\u8209 level excesses, as in Florida\'92s immigration law, but broadly supportive of a presidency that seeks to act first and litigate later.\
\
This judicial posture mattered because of how the administration chose to use its enlarged space. Trump had already ordered a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, bypassing the war\uc0\u8209 powers framework that is supposed to force shared responsibility for war. He had unilaterally imposed tariffs by declaring a national emergency, turning what should be a legislative domain into a field for presidential decree. An executive order asserted that the Constitution vests foreign policy solely in the president, sidelining Congress\'92s treaty and war powers in theory as well as practice. When the Court then blessed broad immunity for \'93official acts,\'94 it did so in a world where those acts already included unauthorized war, emergency\u8209 based trade policy, and sweeping interventions in law enforcement. The clock moved because the combination of doctrine and behavior made emergency powers feel less like exceptions and more like the normal grammar of governance.\
\
The same pattern appeared in the treatment of law as a flexible instrument rather than a binding limit. Trump pardoned supporters involved in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, sending a clear message that violence in service of his cause would be forgiven. He ordered the Department of Justice to scrutinize and punish political opponents, including by targeting their Secret Service protection, collapsing the line between neutral prosecution and presidential vendetta. The administration instructed DOJ not to enforce a TikTok ban for 75 days while it reviewed the law, asserting the right to decide which statutes would be applied and when. At the same time, DOJ and ICE pursued harsh deportations, including the removal of eight men to South Sudan, most with no ties to that country, after Supreme Court decisions allowed third\uc0\u8209 country deportations. Law was soft and negotiable at the top, hard and unforgiving at the bottom. That asymmetry is what the Democracy Clock measures when it records that \'93law is a weapon, not a limit\'94 as moving sharply upward.\
\
Nowhere was this clearer than in immigration and citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for roughly 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans, ending a quarter\uc0\u8209 century of legal stability and exposing families to removal at executive discretion. ICE detained long\u8209 term residents like Cynthia Olivera, a Canadian mother of three US\u8209 born children, and Arpineh Masihi, who had lived in the country since childhood, during routine processes or in front of their families. A Palestinian activist, Mahmoud Khalil, was held for months as a supposed national security threat without charges, and an imam, Ayman Soliman, saw his asylum revoked over disputed charity ties. These cases were not isolated; they sat alongside a trial challenging an \'93ideological deportation\'94 policy aimed at foreign students with pro\u8209 Palestinian views. Citizenship and legal security were being sorted not only by paperwork, but by nationality, politics, and perceived loyalty. When the administration moved to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented parents, it crossed from harsh enforcement into an attempt to redraw the constitutional boundary of membership itself.\
\
Here the courts did push back. A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the birthright\uc0\u8209 citizenship order, certified a nationwide class of affected children, and another judge issued a nationwide block preventing enforcement against babies born after February 20. These rulings, along with the Supreme Court\'92s refusal to let Florida enforce its criminalization of undocumented entry, preserved key elements of the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s promise. They also showed how, after the Court\'92s own limitation on nationwide injunctions, class actions had become the main vehicle for halting sweeping policies. Yet even these victories were defensive and fragile. The same Court that upheld federal primacy over immigration also allowed deportations to third countries and granted immunity to the president. The net effect was a more stratified citizenship regime, in which some protections held while others eroded, and in which the power to decide who belongs tilted further toward the executive.\
\
Beneath these headline fights, the machinery of the state was being remade. The Supreme Court\'92s stays and rulings on Trump\'92s \'93Department of Government Efficiency\'94 order allowed mass layoffs across 19 federal agencies to proceed. The State Department announced plans to cut nearly 15 percent of its domestic staff, then began issuing termination notices to more than 1,300 employees as part of an \'93America First\'94 reorganization. At the National Security Agency and National Security Council, Trump had already fired the NSA director, his deputy, and six NSC staffers after receiving loyalty lists from an outside influencer. The National Security Council itself was described as dysfunctional and blindsided by Pentagon moves. At NASA, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy was appointed to lead the agency as well, after budget cuts had driven out over 2,000 senior employees. These were not random personnel changes; they were a systematic thinning of expertise and neutral capacity, combined with the elevation of loyalists like Emil Bove to appellate courts and Nick Adams to an ambassadorship. Civil service roles were being made more precarious, more politicized, and more easily reshaped by decree.\
\
The same hollowing appeared in the agencies charged with protecting life and health. The National Weather Service lost more than 600 employees to layoffs and early retirements, leaving storm\uc0\u8209 prone offices understaffed. Congress, with Senator Ted Cruz\'92s help, cut tens of millions from weather\u8209 forecasting research and climate\u8209 impact grants. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Science Foundation saw deep budget reductions. In Texas, flash floods killed at least 80 people; officials blamed NWS staffing and funding cuts for inadequate warnings. FEMA, meanwhile, was hamstrung by a new rule from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requiring her personal approval for contracts over $100,000. That bottleneck delayed the deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams for more than 72 hours as the Guadalupe River rose and a girls\'92 camp was swept away. DHS then canceled a $3 million grant meant to improve communication between the Weather Service and local officials, even as search and rescue continued. When the administration announced plans to dismantle FEMA by the end of the hurricane season, arguing that states and private firms could handle disasters, it made explicit what the cuts and delays had already implied: federal emergency management was being treated as dispensable.\
\
Public health followed a similar arc. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of a key CDC vaccine advisory panel, despite earlier pledges not to do so, and replaced them with appointees, many skeptical of vaccines. He spread misinformation on national television, claiming that measles infection was better than vaccination and suggesting that the MMR vaccine caused harms akin to the disease. He launched a large autism research initiative premised on a discredited vaccine link, and he promoted vitamins and cod liver oil as treatments for measles. At the same time, the administration cut funding to health research institutes, and the country recorded at least 1,277 measles cases, a record since the disease had been declared eliminated. Medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, sued HHS and Kennedy over these changes, arguing that they violated administrative law and endangered public health. The lawsuits showed that professional bodies still had tools to resist, but the damage to trust and infrastructure was already visible. When science is subordinated to ideology inside the state, the cost is measured in outbreaks and preventable deaths.\
\
Immigration enforcement became the most visible theater for the new alignment of law, force, and spectacle. In Los Angeles\'92s MacArthur Park, federal agents, backed by about 90 National Guard troops, rolled in with armored vehicles and tactical gear. One raid, broadcast live by Fox News, lasted an hour and produced no known arrests; Border Patrol\'92s chief later said such operations would become \'93normal.\'94 Another large ICE raid in the same neighborhood prompted a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order requiring reasonable suspicion for stops and banning racial profiling. In San Francisco, an unmarked ICE SUV drove through a crowd of protesters outside the immigration court, injuring at least one person, while agents without visible badges used rifles, batons, and pepper spray. In southern California, raids on cannabis farms involved chemical munitions against demonstrators and left a farmworker dead. In Florida, a new detention center in the Everglades\'97\'93Alligator Alcatraz\'94\'97opened with reports of maggot\uc0\u8209 infested food, no running water, and exposure to extreme weather. National Guard troops and Marines were deployed to operate detention facilities and assist ICE. At the same time, DHS dismantled its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and two immigration ombudsman offices, removing internal watchdogs just as arrests and detentions surged.\
\
These operations were not only about immigration. They were also about protest and dissent. The deployment of California\'92s National Guard against mostly peaceful protests over immigration raids, over the governor\'92s objections, marked a federal seizure of state military assets to manage domestic opposition. The use of tear gas and armored convoys in urban neighborhoods, the ramming of protesters by an ICE vehicle, and the denial of entry to a member of Congress at a farm raid all signaled that those who opposed the administration\'92s enforcement agenda could expect to meet overwhelming force. Senator Josh Hawley\'92s letter accusing the immigrant\uc0\u8209 rights group Uni\'f3n del Barrio of \'93aiding and abetting criminal conduct\'94 for monitoring ICE patrols framed community defense as criminality. A journalist, Mario Guevara, was arrested while covering protests, handed to ICE, and kept in detention even after local charges were dropped and bond granted. These patterns moved the traits that track protest rights and paramilitary violence: the state was not only tolerating aggressive tactics when they protected elite interests, it was increasingly using them as a first resort.\
\
While the domestic field was being reshaped, economic power was wielded outward in ways that blurred policy and personal grievance. Trump announced a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian imports, explicitly tying it to what he called a \'93witch\uc0\u8209 hunt\'94 trial against Jair Bolsonaro for attempting to overturn Brazil\'92s 2022 election. He launched a trade investigation into Brazil\'92s social\u8209 media regulations, denouncing its supreme court\'92s fines on platforms as \'93secret and unlawful censorship orders.\'94 He threatened a 25 percent tariff on all imports from South Korea despite an existing free\u8209 trade agreement, and he rolled out new tariffs on seven other countries, including the Philippines, Libya, and Sri Lanka, with rates between 25 and 30 percent. He imposed a 50 percent tariff on copper, driving US prices to record highs, and announced a 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods. These moves came on top of a 90\u8209 day tariff pause that was repeatedly extended and then reset to August 1, creating whiplash for importers and trade partners. Legally, tariff authority belongs to Congress, with presidents able to act in emergencies; in practice, Trump was using emergency declarations and executive orders to make trade policy, often in service of political fights abroad.\
\
Inside the United States, fiscal and regulatory choices deepened the fusion of public power with private gain. The budget reconciliation law made the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations permanent, cut $890 billion from Medicaid and $230 billion from SNAP, and allocated $170.7 billion for immigration enforcement, including $51.6 billion for border wall construction and a 265 percent increase in ICE\'92s detention budget. A report from the Quincy Institute and Brown University showed that the new Pentagon budget would push annual military spending past $1 trillion, with more than half of discretionary funds flowing to contractors. USAID cuts were projected to cause over 14 million deaths globally in five years, many among children. At the same time, the IRS filed a document and announced a policy shift allowing churches to endorse political candidates without losing tax\uc0\u8209 exempt status, while other nonprofits remained constrained. This change invited tax\u8209 subsidized religious institutions to act as partisan machines. In Michigan, reporting revealed that DTE Energy and allied interests had used dark money to undermine COVID\u8209 19 public health policies. In education, the White House\'92s AI initiative enlisted 68 technology companies to provide tools, funding, and curricula, while the American Federation of Teachers accepted $23 million from AI firms to create a National Academy for AI Instruction. OpenAI and Google offered free access to their AI tools for students, cultivating future users. In each case, policy and public institutions were being steered toward corporate platforms and contractor revenue, even as social protections were cut.\
\
Against this backdrop, there were still acts of institutional resistance and repair. Florida\'92s governor signed a near\uc0\u8209 unanimous bill banning oil drilling near national estuarine reserves, protecting inland waterways from spills. Congress enacted laws restoring municipal lands to Alaska Native villages and clarifying eligibility for Alaska Native settlement trusts, strengthening Indigenous governance and economic self\u8209 determination. California streamlined environmental review for infill housing and advanced manufacturing to address its housing shortage. The Environmental Protection Agency approved multiple state air\u8209 quality plans, corrected lead\u8209 hazard rules, and convened a National Drinking Water Advisory Council meeting on PFAS standards. The Office of Government Information Services scheduled a public FOIA meeting, and the FDA sought comment on identity verification for records requests. Democratic senators introduced a bill to bar ICE agents from wearing masks and to require visible identification, aiming to restore transparency in enforcement. Medical organizations sued HHS over vaccine policy changes, Planned Parenthood challenged Medicaid defunding, and a coalition of 18 states filed an amicus brief against Los Angeles immigration raids. These actions did not reverse the week\'92s damage, but they showed that some levers of law and policy remained in use.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 25, several processes were already in motion. The class\uc0\u8209 action lawsuits over birthright citizenship and the ideological deportation policy would test whether courts would continue to draw lines around the Fourteenth Amendment and free speech. The lawsuits over vaccine policy and Planned Parenthood funding would determine how far administrative law could constrain ideologically driven health decisions. The State Department\'92s rolling layoffs, enabled by the Supreme Court, would continue to shrink diplomatic capacity in the weeks to come. The dismantling of FEMA and DHS oversight offices, if carried through, would leave future disasters and detention conditions even more exposed to political whim. The August 1 tariff deadline loomed as a moment when emergency\u8209 based trade policy could harden into a new normal. And the IRS\'92s church\u8209 endorsement policy, once tested in court, would either be entrenched or checked, with lasting consequences for the role of religion in electoral politics.\
\
By the end of Week 25, the Democracy Clock\'92s move to 7:52 p.m. captured a shift less in the volume of crisis than in its structure. The presidency had acquired new legal armor and was using it to act unilaterally in war, trade, and enforcement. The Supreme Court had moved from sporadic restraint to a pattern of enabling executive projects, especially those that weakened the civil service and concentrated discretion. Immigration and disaster systems, once designed to protect life and manage risk, were being repurposed as instruments of fear, neglect, and political theater. Economic and fiscal policy locked in inequality and channeled public funds toward contractors and aligned institutions, including churches and detention operators. Information and science were contested terrain, with anti\uc0\u8209 vaccine rhetoric and conspiracy\u8209 driven investigations emanating from inside the state. Yet the week also reminded us that resistance persists: in lower courts that blocked the most extreme citizenship changes, in states and civil society that sued over raids and pollution, in legislators who sought to unmask agents and investigate FEMA delays. The official time at the close of the period\'977:52 p.m.\'97marks a democracy still standing, but with its guardrails thinner, its institutions more pliable, and its evening light fading faster than before.\
