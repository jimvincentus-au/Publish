# Week 4 Appendix: Parallel State as Method of Rule

This week shows an aggressive acceleration of authoritarian restructuring rather than isolated abuses. The Trump–Musk axis used executive orders and DOGE to hollow out the civil service, freeze or redirect science and foreign-aid funding, and move toward dismantling entire agencies (Education, CFPB, NOAA, USAID, NASA DEI). Simultaneously, justice and oversight mechanisms were attacked: the Office of Government Ethics and multiple inspectors general were purged; DOJ leadership intervened to protect a politically useful mayor; anti-corruption enforcement (FCPA) was paused while a corrupt governor was pardoned. Courts repeatedly pushed back—blocking NIH cuts, immigration abuses, birthright-citizenship changes, transgender health restrictions, and funding freezes—but the administration openly defied injunctions, turning the rule of law into a contested terrain rather than a settled constraint. Information control and memory politics intensified through mass deletion of DEI and health content, censorship in Pentagon schools, retaliation against AP, and erasure of trans history at Stonewall. Abroad, the administration floated resource-extraction “peace” deals for Ukraine and an explicit ethnic-cleansing plan for Gaza, while aligning with far-right forces in Europe. The net effect is major structural pressure on nearly every safeguard of liberal democracy, partially offset by unusually robust judicial and civil-society resistance.

President Trump announced and executed a purge of Kennedy Center board members while declaring himself chair (2025-02-07): By firing the Kennedy Center’s leadership and claiming the chairmanship for himself, Trump asserted direct political control over a major national cultural institution, weakening its arm’s‑length governance and signaling willingness to personalize public authority.

2. President Trump issued an executive order prioritizing asylum for Afrikaners from South Africa (2025-02-08): Trump’s order to prioritize Afrikaner resettlement used executive discretion in refugee policy to favor a specific white ethnic group, raising concerns about racially selective protection and politicized use of humanitarian powers.

3. President Trump cut federal funding and issued a stop‑work order for a Colorado immigrant legal‑services nonprofit (2025-01-20): Halting funds for a key immigrant legal‑aid provider in Colorado used executive spending power to curtail access to counsel for undocumented people, weakening due process protections in immigration proceedings.

4.

President Trump signed executive orders directing health agencies and NASA to scrub diversity‑related language and DEI structures (2025-01-20): Orders forcing removal of race, gender, LGBTQ+, and disability terms from health and NASA materials centralized ideological control over scientific agencies, constraining how public institutions can describe inequality and health risks.

6. President Trump issued an executive order to review and potentially roll back gun regulations in the name of Second Amendment protection (2025-02-09): Ordering a sweeping review of gun rules framed firearms rights as foundational to all liberties, potentially privileging one constitutional interest over others and reshaping the balance between individual rights and public safety.

7. President Trump repurposed the U.S. Digital Service into Elon Musk–run DOGE with authority to cancel payments, suspend programs, and target employees (2025-02-10): Turning a technical service unit into DOGE under Musk concentrated opaque power over budgets and personnel in a quasi‑private actor, blurring lines between public authority and corporate influence.

8. President Trump eliminated the Federal Executive Institute by executive order (2025-02-10): Closing the Federal Executive Institute removed a longstanding, nonpartisan training hub for senior civil servants, weakening professional development and making the higher civil service more vulnerable to politicization.

11. President Trump prepared an executive order to reverse bans on bank overdraft fees and allow medical debt to hurt credit scores (2025-02-09): Rolling back consumer protections on overdraft fees and medical‑debt reporting would use executive authority to shift financial risk onto vulnerable borrowers, weakening regulatory safeguards enacted through prior processes.

12.

20. President Trump signed an executive order halting federal funding to schools and universities with COVID‑19 vaccine mandates (2025-02-14): Conditioning education funding on dropping vaccine mandates used fiscal power to override local public‑health judgments and constrain institutional autonomy in managing health risks.

21. President Trump issued an executive order defining sex as strictly male or female and prompting removal of transgender references from federal sites (2025-02-14): Mandating a binary legal definition of sex and erasing trans references from the Stonewall monument site used executive power to narrow recognized identities, reshaping civil‑rights baselines and public memory.


Institutions and Governance

1.

2. Senator Angus King used a confirmation hearing to warn about expansive presidential power and Vought’s views (2025-02-07): King’s questioning of Russell Vought and public warnings about constitutional “shredding” framed certain executive theories as blueprints for authoritarianism, reinforcing the Senate’s role in scrutinizing nominees’ views on separation of powers.

3. House of Representatives recorded an ethics violation by Rep. Byron Donalds for proxy voting via his card (2025-02-08): A member’s use of another person to cast votes in violation of House rules underscored vulnerabilities in internal enforcement mechanisms meant to ensure personal accountability for legislative decisions.

4. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols blocked the Trump administration from placing thousands of USAID employees on leave and from shutting down the agency (2025-02-07): Nichols’s orders stopping mass leave at USAID and requiring justification for shutdown efforts asserted judicial oversight over attempts to sideline a major foreign‑aid agency without clear legal basis.

5. U.S. District Court in Rhode Island ruled that the administration violated a funding‑freeze TRO and ordered immediate release of funds (2025-02-10): By enforcing its earlier restraining order on frozen federal funds, the court reaffirmed that the executive must comply with judicial directives when administering congressionally appropriated money.

6. Federal courts temporarily blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury systems and placing USAID staff on leave (2025-02-08): Emergency orders halting DOGE’s access to Treasury payment systems and personnel actions at USAID underscored judicial concern over legality and privacy in a rapidly expanding executive initiative.

17. Senate of the United States confirmed Russell Vought as director of the Office of Management and Budget (2025-02-10): Confirming Vought, an advocate of demoralizing and shrinking the civil service, placed a committed executive‑power maximalist in charge of budget execution and regulatory review.

Economic Structure

1. Trump administration and NIH announced and attempted to implement a cap on indirect costs for NIH grants, amounting to $4 billion in annual cuts (2025-02-07): Capping NIH overhead at 15 percent would shift billions away from research infrastructure, straining universities and labs and redistributing federal science support without new legislation.

2. Department of Government Efficiency announced identifying over $1 billion in federal spending cuts in its first weeks (2025-02-08): DOGE’s early claim of $1 billion in cuts illustrated how a lightly accountable unit could rapidly reshape budget priorities, with unclear criteria and limited public scrutiny of affected programs.

9. Elon Musk and DOGE eliminated nearly $1 billion in Department of Education research contracts, including the Institute of Education Sciences (2025-02-11): Terminating IES and related contracts dismantled a major source of education data and evaluation, weakening evidence‑based policymaking in favor of ideologically driven cuts.

10. Trump administration froze foreign funding and USAID programs that supported democracy and human‑rights monitoring abroad (2025-02-10): Halting grants to groups tracking Chinese influence and abuses reduced U.S. soft‑power tools and signaled a retreat from supporting democratic norms through aid.

11. House Republicans proposed a budget resolution cutting $2 trillion from mandatory spending while expanding tax cuts (2025-02-10): The GOP budget blueprint sought deep reductions to Social Security, Medicare, and food aid alongside large tax cuts for the wealthy, rebalancing fiscal policy away from the social safety net.

12. President Trump signed a memorandum directing development of a reciprocal tariff plan against trading partners (2025-02-13): Ordering studies for broad “reciprocal” tariffs prepared the ground for sweeping trade changes that could raise consumer prices and be used to reward or punish specific countries.

13. President Trump pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates while proposing new tax cuts and tariffs (2025-02-14): Publicly urging rate cuts and pairing them with expansionary tax and tariff plans risked politicizing monetary policy and complicating efforts to manage inflation and growth.

14. Uline and its owners used Mexican workers on U.S. visas at far below domestic wage levels in warehouses (2025-02-12): Allegations that a donor‑owned firm underpaid Mexican workers and coached them to mislead immigration officials highlighted how labor and visa systems can be exploited to undercut protections and wages.

16. President Trump threatened tariffs on countries that maintain value‑added taxes (2025-02-12): Threatening tariffs against VAT‑using countries signaled willingness to weaponize trade rules against standard tax systems abroad, risking retaliatory measures and trade instability.

17. Trump administration and NIH maintained an NIH funding freeze despite two federal injunctions before finally rescinding it (2025-02-11): Persisting with an NIH grant freeze in defiance of court orders disrupted biomedical research and showed how executive control over disbursement can override legal and scientific priorities.

18. EPA and OSHA issued multiple regulatory notices on environmental impacts and workplace chemical standards (2025-02-14): Routine EPA and OSHA actions on air quality, environmental impact statements, and hazardous‑chemical reporting showed ongoing technocratic regulation even amid broader political turbulence.

19. DEA and multiple pharmaceutical or research firms processed applications to manufacture or import controlled substances for research and production (2025-02-13): DEA notices on controlled‑substance manufacturing and import reflected ongoing regulatory gatekeeping over potentially addictive drugs, balancing research needs with diversion risks.

20. Trump administration implemented an executive order that caused surcharges and halted home‑energy rebate programs for low‑income households (2025-02-13): Energy‑policy changes that produced $100 surcharges and canceled rebate programs shifted costs onto low‑income ratepayers, illustrating how executive budget maneuvers can deepen inequality.

21. Altadena property market actors moved quickly to sell burned lots in a historically Black neighborhood after a major wildfire (2025-02-12): Rapid resale of fire‑damaged land at premium prices in a Black community raised fears of disaster‑driven gentrification, where recovery dynamics can displace long‑time residents.


Civil Rights and Dissent

1. Mexican environmental regulators ordered urgent cleanup and shutdown of unauthorized equipment at a hazardous‑waste plant near Monterrey (2025-02-08): Forcing a U.S.‑linked plant to address massive toxic‑waste mismanagement protected nearby communities’ health and demonstrated regulatory willingness to confront cross‑border industrial harms.

2. Federal courts blocked transfer of Venezuelan immigrants to Guantánamo Bay (2025-02-08): Stopping the transfer of three Venezuelan immigrants to a military prison preserved their access to civilian legal processes and resisted normalization of offshore detention for migrants.

3. Colorado ICE and associated federal agencies conducted heavily armed raids in Denver‑area apartments, arresting 30 people with minimal gang ties (2025-02-09): High‑profile raids that netted mostly non‑gang suspects heightened fear among undocumented residents and suggested immigration enforcement was being used as a show of force rather than targeted public‑safety work.

4. Trump administration and DOJ ordered ICE raids and policies that allowed agents into schools, prompting a lawsuit by Denver Public Schools (2025-02-13): Allowing ICE access to schools forced districts to divert resources and chilled attendance, undermining equal access to education for immigrant students and prompting legal resistance.

5. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 8,200 people in late January under a mass‑deportation push (2025-02-12): ICE’s large‑scale arrests, publicized without clear data on criminal histories or locations, raised concerns about indiscriminate enforcement and the use of opaque statistics to justify aggressive deportation.

6. ICE leadership and Trump administration reassigned senior ICE officials for failing to meet deportation targets and planned more aggressive actions (2025-02-12): Reassigning ICE leaders over deportation numbers signaled that career officials would be punished for not delivering politically desired enforcement metrics, pressuring the bureaucracy toward harsher practices.

7. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City announced and then implemented reopening of an ICE office at Rikers Island jail (2025-02-14): Restoring ICE presence at Rikers reversed sanctuary‑style limits on local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, exposing detained immigrants to closer federal scrutiny and potential deportation.

8. U.S. Department of Justice leadership ordered prosecutors to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, prompting multiple resignations (2025-02-13): Top‑down instructions to dismiss a high‑profile corruption case, justified partly by Adams’s value to deportation efforts, blurred lines between law enforcement and political expediency.

9. Trump administration abolished the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force and a DOJ task force targeting Russian oligarchs (2025-02-13): Eliminating units focused on foreign election interference and oligarch sanctions weakened institutional defenses against external manipulation of U.S. democracy and elite financial crime.

10. Trump administration directed federal agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees and initiated mass layoffs across multiple agencies (2025-02-13): Mass firings of probationary staff and large‑scale layoffs at Education, SBA, CFPB, GSA, Energy, and VA hollowed out public‑service capacity and increased political control over who remains in government.

11. Federal judiciary allowed Trump’s deferred resignation “Fork in the Road” buyout program for federal workers to proceed (2025-02-13): By finding unions lacked standing to challenge mass buyout offers, courts enabled a program that could shrink the civil service significantly through financially pressured resignations.

12. Fremont, California City Council passed an ordinance criminalizing camping on public property and aiding homeless encampments (2025-02-12): Fremont’s law exposed unhoused people and those assisting them to fines and jail, using criminal law to manage poverty and potentially chilling mutual‑aid efforts.

13. Congresswoman Nancy Mace used a House floor speech to accuse several men, including her ex‑fiancé, of rape and abuse and criticized state prosecutors (2025-02-11): Mace’s speech highlighted perceived failures of state justice systems to prosecute sexual violence, using legislative privilege to surface allegations that might otherwise remain unaddressed.

14. Denver Public Schools and New York State faced federal lawsuits and policies challenging their immigration‑related protections and driver’s‑license laws (2025-02-13): Federal suits against New York’s “green light” law and policies affecting Denver schools exemplified how immigration enforcement is used to contest state and local efforts to protect undocumented residents.

15. Trump administration and Pentagon school system suspended access to many school library books for a DEI‑related compliance review (2025-02-13): Pulling books on gender and equity from Pentagon‑run school libraries curtailed students’ access to contested ideas, using security‑style reviews to shape what military families’ children can read.

Information, Memory and Manipulation

1. Trump administration and federal health agencies removed large amounts of DEI‑related and HIV public‑health information from agency websites (2025-01-20): Scrubbing diversity and HIV content from health sites limited public access to information on marginalized groups’ health needs, aligning official communication with ideological directives rather than evidence.

2. National Security Agency conducted a “Big Delete” of internal and public content containing 27 banned DEI‑related words (2025-02-10): NSA’s rushed purge of terms like “privilege” and “inclusion” from networks and websites showed how security agencies can be drawn into ideological information control that disrupts mission work.

3. Elon Musk reposted a tweet exposing personal information about a judge’s daughter involved in a DOGE‑related case (2025-02-10): Amplifying doxxing of a judge’s family member risked intimidating the judiciary and signaled that private actors aligned with the administration might target legal opponents personally.

4. Elon Musk’s DOGE website added data from the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s “unconstitutionality index” to its public dashboard (2025-02-12): Featuring a partisan think tank’s index on an official‑looking site blurred lines between neutral government data and ideological advocacy, shaping public perceptions of regulation.

5. White House communications staff barred AP reporters from certain press events and later banned AP journalists from the Oval Office and Air Force One (2025-02-12): Retaliating against AP for refusing to adopt “Gulf of America” terminology used access control to pressure editorial choices, undermining norms of equal treatment for independent media.

6. Elon Musk’s DOGE team published classified National Reconnaissance Office budget and personnel information on its website (2025-02-13): Posting classified NRO details on a DOGE site breached secrecy norms and raised questions about how politically connected actors handle sensitive intelligence data.

7. Elon Musk’s associates at OPM gained unprecedented access to federal HR databases containing sensitive personal information (2025-02-12): Granting Musk‑linked personnel broad access to medical and personnel records of millions of federal employees blurred boundaries between public data stewardship and private interests, heightening privacy and abuse risks.

8. Trump administration purged transgender references from the Stonewall National Monument website (2025-02-14): Erasing trans contributions from the Stonewall site rewrote a key civil‑rights narrative, using federal control over heritage interpretation to marginalize a group’s role in history.

9. Trump administration and DOGE used curated metrics and selective publication of enforcement and spending data to justify cuts and structural changes (2025-02-14): DOGE’s dashboards and selective statistics on “efficiency” and regulation framed sweeping agency cuts as technocratic necessity, obscuring distributional and democratic impacts.

10. Trump administration and allied media continued to promote narratives of voter fraud and suppression as explanations for electoral outcomes (2025-02-09): Ongoing amplification of voter‑fraud claims, as documented by watchdogs, normalized disinformation that undermines confidence in elections and justifies restrictive voting measures.

11. Elon Musk and allied politicians abroad were criticized for interfering in European elections and supporting far‑right candidates (2025-02-12): European leaders’ complaints about Musk’s political interventions highlighted how transnational elites can use platforms and money to shape foreign electoral narratives and outcomes.

12. Trump administration used official communications to publicize ICE arrest numbers without key contextual data (2025-02-12): Releasing headline arrest totals while omitting locations and criminal histories allowed the administration to portray mass deportations as targeted crime control, shaping public perception through incomplete data.

13. Trump administration pressured independent media and dissenting institutions by labeling them misinformers or “deep state” actors (2025-02-14): Rhetoric against AP, federal employees, and sanctuary jurisdictions framed critics as unpatriotic or deceptive, contributing to an environment where dissenting information sources are delegitimized.

14. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas shifted from supporting to questioning the New York Times v.
