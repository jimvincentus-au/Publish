\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 33 Appendix: Emergency as Operating System\
\
This week shows an executive branch openly testing the outer limits of constitutional constraint while building parallel systems of coercion and narrative control. Trump and his lieutenants moved aggressively on three fronts: weaponizing immigration and security powers, politicizing science and the civil service, and hardening a militarized response to domestic governance problems. Mass firings and funding cuts at CDC and HHS, the removal of vaccine experts, and state-level rollbacks of school vaccine mandates collectively degrade public-health capacity and entrench anti-scientific patronage networks. Immigration policy is being turned into a multi-layered enforcement machine\'97expanded ICE and USCIS arrest powers, spyware, mass detention, and incentives for local police\'97backed by threats to deploy National Guard and even Navy bases as immigration hubs. Simultaneously, the administration is attempting to reshape memory and accountability around Epstein and January 6 while using DOJ selectively against opponents and protesters. Courts, states, and some in Congress mounted notable resistance on tariffs, military deployments, deportations, and funding retaliation, but these checks are reactive and fragmented. Structurally, the week exerts strong pressure toward normalized emergency governance, politicized law enforcement, and a patronage-driven administrative state.\
