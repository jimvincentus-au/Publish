<h1>Week 35 Appendix: Security As Presidential Clay</h1>
<p><em>National Guard deployments, immigration raids, and curated memory showed how ordinary tools of government were reshaped around one man’s fears and advantage.</em></p>
<p>This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power and a sharp authoritarian turn in multiple domains. The Trump administration used emergency rhetoric, military deployments, and immigration crackdowns to override local authority (Memphis, DC, Camp 57) while openly defying statutory and judicial constraints (TikTok delay, Lisa Cook removal push, tariff litigation). Law is increasingly weaponized: RICO threats against protesters, politicized prosecutions and firings (Maurene Comey, Erik Siebert, Letitia James pressure), and Supreme Court-sanctioned warrantless immigration raids. Simultaneously, the information sphere was hit with a coordinated campaign: FCC threats and corporate compliance produced the effective silencing of Jimmy Kimmel; DOJ removed research on far‑right violence; national parks stripped slavery exhibits; and senior officials spread election and violence disinformation. Public health and science governance were gutted via RFK Jr’s purge of vaccine advisory bodies, CDC leadership firing, and EPA’s move to rescind the endangerment finding. Immigration and citizenship were stratified through harsh enforcement, solitary confinement, child detention abuses, TPS fights, and a new pay‑to‑enter “Gold Card” visa. There are pockets of resistance—courts blocking some deportations and Cook’s firing, congressional investigations, state-level vaccine guidance—but the net structural pressure is strongly toward entrenched authoritarian governance.</p>
