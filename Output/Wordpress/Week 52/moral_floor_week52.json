  "weekly_audit": {
    "summary": "This week saw a continuation of serious breaches in character, ethics, restraint, and truthfulness, with the executive branch further consolidating power and undermining accountability mechanisms. The aggressive immigration enforcement in Minnesota, coupled with the administration's manipulation of narratives surrounding the killing of Renee Good, exemplified a troubling trend of prioritizing state power over civil rights and institutional integrity. While there were instances of institutional pushback, they were largely reactive and insufficient to counter the overarching trend of power consolidation and erosion of checks and balances.",

This week, the aggressive assertion of executive authority, coupled with a disregard for truthfulness and ethics, has further strained the capacity of democratic institutions to function effectively. While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level. The cumulative effect of these actions has resulted in a net loss of democratic safety, as indicated by the slight inward movement of the Democracy Clock.",
