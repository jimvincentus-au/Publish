Subtle American flags and agency seals appear in shadow, while cables lead from the building into a private tech campus on the horizon. Painterly, realistic style, moody, emphasizing centralization of power and hollowed-out bureaucracy."

  "long_synopsis": "Week 6 of Trump\u2019s second term registered only a 0.2\u2011minute shift on the Democracy Clock, from 7:51 to 7:52 p.m., but the institutional movement was far larger. The White House and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency tightened control over federal payments, data, and personnel, ordering mass layoff plans and purging scientific agencies while courts scrambled to block the most brazen firings and data grabs. Immigration policy became a proving ground for stratified citizenship: mass\u2011deportation pledges, Guant\u00e1namo detention, biometric registries, and a $5 million \u201cgold card\u201d path to citizenship sorted people by wealth, origin, and identity. Law and regulation bent toward donors and insiders as the SEC retreated from cases involving major pro\u2011Trump crypto backers and Jared Kushner\u2019s foreign\u2011funded ventures shaped Gaza and Ukraine policy. Simultaneously, the administration moved against transgender people and DEI infrastructure, shuttered civil\u2011rights oversight, and tightened control over media access, language, and archives. Courts, unions, governors, protesters, and foreign consumers mounted resistance, but largely in reaction to a state being refitted for patronage and personal rule.",
