\
The first week of Trump\'92s second term opened with a rush, not a drift. Power moved fast, by signature and decree. The pattern was clear: use the tools of the presidency to redraw who belongs, who is protected, and who can hold the executive to account. It was a week of first principles, tested in real time. Birthright citizenship, term limits, the neutrality of law, the independence of watchdogs, and the basic safety of dissent all came under pressure. The Democracy Clock, which had stood at 7:31 p.m. at the close of the previous term, now jumped forward to 7:55 p.m., a shift of 23 minutes in five days. That movement captures not just the volume of orders, but the kind of republic those orders began to build.\
\
The previous period ended with institutions strained but standing. At 7:31 p.m., the system still assumed that constitutional baselines\'97citizenship by birth, two presidential terms, neutral prosecutors, independent inspectors general\'97were hard to move. Week 1 showed how quickly those assumptions could be tested. The new time, 7:55 p.m., reflects a structural turn. Executive power began to operate with less effective oversight. Emergency powers were treated as routine tools. Law was used more as a weapon than a limit. The civil service and internal watchdogs were recast as obstacles to be purged or privatized. Most of all, the meaning of citizenship itself was put on the table, and the formal project of loosening presidential term limits began. The clock moved because these were not symbolic gestures alone; they were backed by orders, deployments, and bills that, if left in place, would be hard to reverse.\
\
The sharpest break with the past came in the attempt to rewrite who counts as an American. On his first day, Trump signed an order titled \'93Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\'94 declaring that children born in the United States to mothers unlawfully present, or to parents without citizenship or permanent residency, would no longer receive automatic citizenship. Parallel versions of this policy appeared across the week: White House releases, Federal Register entries, and public framing that birthright citizenship had been \'93misinterpreted\'94 for generations. The order instructed agencies to withhold documents from these children and set a 30\uc0\u8209 day clock for implementation. Civil rights groups and a coalition of states sued almost immediately. Within days, federal judges in Washington and Seattle, including a Reagan appointee, issued temporary restraining orders, calling the move \'93blatantly unconstitutional.\'94 For the moment, the Fourteenth Amendment held. But the presence of the threat changed the landscape. Citizenship, once treated as a settled birthright, was now something a president claimed the power to narrow by fiat.\
\
Alongside this, the administration moved to stratify belonging in other ways. Asylum and refugee protections were suspended or sharply curtailed. The CBP One app, which had allowed migrants to schedule lawful entry appointments, was shut down without warning, canceling roughly 30,000 bookings and leaving hundreds of thousands in limbo along the border. The \'93Remain in Mexico\'94 policy was reinstated, forcing asylum seekers to wait in dangerous conditions outside U.S. territory. Expedited removal was restored nationwide, allowing ICE to deport people who could not prove two years\'92 presence without full hearings. Arrests in schools, churches, and hospitals\'97long treated as \'93sensitive locations\'94\'97were authorized again. A new Laken Riley Act, passed by both chambers and sent to Trump\'92s desk, mandated detention of undocumented people charged with certain crimes and empowered state attorneys general to sue the federal government for perceived under\uc0\u8209 enforcement. In Mississippi, a legislator proposed cash bounties for \'93illegal alien\'94 deportations. Together, these moves did more than tighten enforcement. They built a layered system in which legal status, place of birth, and even proximity to enforcement sites determined how much protection a person could expect from the law.\
\
While the administration narrowed who belonged, it also began to test how long one man might remain in office. In the House, Representative Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment to allow a third presidential term, written in a way that would benefit Trump but not prior presidents. A parallel resolution appeared with the same aim. On their own, these proposals did not change the law; amending the Twenty\uc0\u8209 Second Amendment requires supermajorities and state ratifications. But their introduction marked a shift from rhetoric to formal project. Term limits, once treated as a hard boundary, became a subject of partisan engineering. The Democracy Clock registered this as a significant move: the trait tracking efforts to repeal or circumvent term limits jumped sharply, with both presence and difficulty rising. Once a serious campaign to relax term limits begins, even if it fails, the expectation that presidents leave after two terms is no longer automatic.\
\
The way law was used in Week 1 also changed. The most visible example was the mass clemency for January 6 participants. On Inauguration Day and in the days that followed, Trump issued \'93full, complete and unconditional\'94 pardons or commutations for more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the Capitol attack, including leaders of extremist groups and many who assaulted police officers. He ordered the Department of Justice to dismiss pending cases. In interviews, he described the violence as \'93very minor\'94 and cast the rioters as \'93hostages.\'94 Law enforcement unions, federal judges, and even some Republican officials condemned the move, warning that it undermined the rule of law and endangered officers. Yet the pardons stood. At the same time, Trump pardoned anti\uc0\u8209 abortion activists convicted under the FACE Act and Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road drug marketplace. In parallel, he signed an order pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, instructing DOJ to halt prosecutions of Americans accused of bribing foreign officials until new guidance was written. Taken together, these acts sent a clear signal: crimes committed in service of the leader\'92s narrative or by those aligned with his interests would be forgiven or deprioritized, while law would be sharpened against opponents.\
\
That sharpening was visible in new investigative orders. Trump signed directives titled \'93Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government\'94 and \'93Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship,\'94 instructing the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to review the prior four years of law\uc0\u8209 enforcement and intelligence activity for alleged political bias. Another order revoked the security clearances of fifty former intelligence officials and John Bolton, citing their public criticism of Trump in 2020. DOJ memos followed, creating a \'93sanctuary cities enforcement working group\'94 and urging prosecutors to investigate state and local officials who resisted the mass deportation campaign for \'93harboring\'94 undocumented people or withholding information. A separate executive order targeted specific law firms and attorneys associated with litigation against Trump\u8209 aligned media and interests. In public, Trump suggested that Biden himself might face prosecution. The pattern was not subtle. Investigative and prosecutorial tools were being redirected from neutral enforcement toward the president\'92s enemies, while those who had used violence on his behalf were brought back into public life with clean records.\
\
Inside the government, the structures meant to check such moves were weakened. On his first day, Trump reinstated and expanded Schedule F, reclassifying tens of thousands of policy\uc0\u8209 influencing civil servants as excepted service employees who could be fired more easily. Agencies were ordered to identify \'93deep state\'94 officials for removal. An executive order on federal hiring emphasized ideological commitment to \'93American ideals\'94 and prohibited consideration of race, sex, or religion, but in context it functioned as a loyalty screen. Independent regulatory agencies were told to align their budgets and policy priorities with White House approval. The Department of Government Efficiency\'97DOGE\'97was created inside the Executive Office of the President, absorbing the U.S. Digital Service and placing Elon Musk\'92s \'93efficiency\'94 teams inside every major agency. Musk himself was given a West Wing office and access to privileged information. Later in the week, reports emerged that Trump had fired the inspectors general of at least a dozen major agencies, apparently without the statutory 30\u8209 day notice to Congress. The TSA administrator and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee were dismissed. The head of the Coast Guard, Admiral Linda Fagan, was removed over her support for diversity and inclusion. The civil\u8209 rights division at DOJ was ordered to freeze all cases and stop filing new complaints. In a single week, the neutral machinery of oversight\'97IGs, career prosecutors, civil\u8209 rights lawyers, independent regulators\'97was thinned out or placed under direct political control.\
\
The same logic extended to the broader civil service. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government were terminated. Two executive orders shut down DEI and DEIA offices, placed their staff on leave, and revoked a web of prior orders dating back to the civil\uc0\u8209 rights era. Executive Order 11246, which since 1965 had required federal contractors to avoid discrimination in hiring and employment, was repealed. A new order, \'93Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit\u8209 Based Opportunity,\'94 reframed equity initiatives as unlawful preferences and directed agencies to police \'93illegal DEI\'94 in the private sector. Employees were encouraged to report colleagues who continued such work. The effect was not only to remove tools for addressing discrimination, but to stigmatize the very language of equity inside government. Civil\u8209 rights enforcement was further weakened by the freeze on DOJ cases and by pardons for those who had obstructed access to clinics. The trait tracking politicization and privatization of the civil service rose sharply; so did the measure for ethics structures becoming toothless.\
\
Emergency powers, which had expanded in earlier years, were normalized and broadened. Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, despite crossings being at a multi\uc0\u8209 year low. The declaration authorized the deployment of active\u8209 duty troops and Marines to the border, joining thousands of Guard and reserve personnel already there. A separate order revised the Unified Command Plan to make border security a core mission of U.S. Northern Command, blurring the line between external defense and domestic enforcement. Another order, \'93Protecting the American People Against Invasion,\'94 revoked prior immigration relaxations, created Homeland Security task forces in every state, and prioritized prosecution of immigration offenses. Drug cartels were designated as foreign terrorist organizations, opening the door to broader use of military and intelligence tools. At the same time, Trump declared a national energy emergency, fast\u8209 tracking fossil fuel projects, rolling back drilling restrictions in Alaska, suspending offshore wind leasing, and revoking climate\u8209 related orders. These emergencies were not responses to sudden shocks; they were instruments for advancing campaign promises. The Democracy Clock registered this as a structural shift: emergency powers were no longer exceptional, but a standing part of governance in immigration and energy.\
\
The week also deepened the fusion of public office with private wealth. Trump launched and promoted his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, and a companion MELANIA coin, with large reserved stakes for a company he controlled. The coins quickly reached multi\uc0\u8209 billion\u8209 dollar market capitalizations, aided by listings and promotion on major exchanges that were themselves under SEC scrutiny. A separate order created a strategic bitcoin reserve funded by forfeited assets. Another proposed a sovereign wealth fund, outside the Federal Reserve and Treasury, that could be used for purchases like TikTok. At the same time, the Trump Organization announced new foreign real\u8209 estate deals in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Vietnam, and Serbia, including Trump Tower Belgrade on land leased from the Serbian government through Jared Kushner\'92s fund. The company\'92s new ethics statement dropped prior self\u8209 limits on foreign deals during Trump\'92s presidency. An investigation by CREW found 168 new products added to Trump\'92s online store since November, monetizing his return to office. In this environment, Trump\'92s decision to pause FCPA enforcement and to delay a congressionally mandated TikTok ban\'97while floating the idea of a 50% government stake in the app\'97took on a different color. The trait measuring crony capitalism\'92s merger with governance rose; so did the measure for wealth buying not just speech but law.\
\
Information and memory were contested as well. On one side, Trump ordered the declassification and release of records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., fulfilling a transparency promise and potentially easing decades of speculation. On the other, his administration dismantled the federal police misconduct database, making it harder to track abusive officers. HHS, CDC, and FDA were placed under a communications blackout: external advisories, scientific reports, and even website updates were paused, and travel, contracts, and grants were frozen. A pending report on avian influenza was among the casualties. At the same time, the FCC under new leadership reinstated Trump campaign complaints against major networks and the president publicly called for MSNBC to lose its license. Trump\'92s false claims about Biden\'92s clemency, California\'92s fire response, and the 2020 election continued. Orders and rhetoric framed prior public\uc0\u8209 health and content\u8209 moderation efforts as \'93censorship\'94 and \'93weaponization,\'94 casting doubt on the legitimacy of earlier institutional decisions. Symbolic orders renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and Denali as Mount McKinley, and a \'93One flag policy\'94 barred Pride and Black Lives Matter flags from U.S. embassies. These acts did not change material conditions directly, but they curated which histories and identities the state would honor.\
\
Not every development moved in the same direction. Courts acted as a brake in several places. Federal judges quickly blocked the birthright citizenship order, reaffirming the Fourteenth Amendment\'92s plain text. A judge in Washington issued a restraining order on the same policy in a separate case. Another court barred Stewart Rhodes and other Oath Keepers from entering Washington, D.C., as a condition of release. A massive settlement between Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family, and thousands of plaintiffs over the opioid crisis advanced, with the family agreeing to relinquish control and pay $7.4 billion, subject to court approval. State\uc0\u8209 level actions, like California\'92s $20 fast\u8209 food minimum wage and Indiana\'92s bill to strip tax exemptions from price\u8209 gouging nonprofit hospitals, showed legislatures using their power to check corporate behavior. Civil society networks prepared coordinated legal challenges to Trump\'92s orders, and states like California led multistate suits. These acts did not reverse the week\'92s structural shifts, but they showed that some guardrails remained active.\
\
There were also signs of resistance within the president\'92s own coalition. Republican senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins announced opposition to Pete Hegseth\'92s nomination as defense secretary, citing allegations of sexual assault, financial mismanagement, and extremist Christian nationalist views. An affidavit from a former relative described aggressive behavior and misogynistic statements. Other Republicans raised concerns about Howard Lutnick\'92s nomination as commerce secretary, given his deep ties to Tether and the cryptocurrency industry. Some senior Trump allies worried about Elon Musk\'92s access to sensitive information from his West Wing office. Law enforcement unions condemned the January 6 pardons. Mexico refused landing permission for a U.S. deportation flight, and India negotiated the repatriation of undocumented Indians to protect legal visa channels. These reactions did not stop the orders, but they complicated the picture of a fully consolidated regime.\
\
Looking ahead from Week 1, several processes were already in motion. The lawsuits over birthright citizenship, asylum suspensions, and DEI dismantling would move through the courts, testing how far doctrine could restrain executive ambition. The new January 6 subcommittee in the House would begin its work, seeking to rewrite the narrative of the attack. The Laken Riley Act awaited Trump\'92s signature, poised to harden detention rules and invite state lawsuits over immigration enforcement. The Federal Election Commission\'92s closed meeting on enforcement and litigation would proceed, largely out of public view. The Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council would begin its assessment, with the potential to recommend structural changes that could weaken or reshape FEMA. And the proposed amendment to allow a third Trump term would sit in Congress, a marker of intent even if it never advanced.\
\
By the end of Week 1, the Democracy Clock\'92s new time\'977:55 p.m.\'97captured a republic that had not yet crossed into open authoritarian rule, but had taken large steps toward it. The Civic Covenant, the shared understanding that power would be exercised with restraint, truthfulness, and stewardship, showed visible cracks. Executive orders were used to test constitutional boundaries on citizenship and term limits. Law was bent to protect allies and intimidate opponents. Watchdogs and civil servants were purged or subordinated. Emergency powers were normalized. Public memory and information flows were curated to favor the regime\'92s story. At the same time, courts, states, and civil society still acted, sometimes quickly, to resist. That tension defined the week. The official end\uc0\u8209 of\u8209 period time, 7:55 p.m., marks the start of a new arc: a presidency that begins by pushing against the outer edges of the constitutional order, and a set of institutions and citizens forced to decide how much of that push they will accept.\
\
## Week 1 Events\
\
### Power and Authority\
\
1. President Joe Biden commuted Leonard Peltier\'92s life sentence to home confinement (2025-01-20): Biden\'92s commutation for Leonard Peltier responded to long\uc0\u8209 criticized prosecutorial misconduct and Indigenous rights concerns, using clemency powers to mitigate a contested conviction while leaving broader accountability for FBI and Justice Department practices unresolved.\
\
2. President Joe Biden issued pre\uc0\u8209 emptive pardons to family members and Trump critics (2025-01-20): Biden\'92s pre\u8209 emptive pardons for relatives and officials tied to January 6 investigations used clemency to shield potential future targets of the incoming administration, testing norms around using pardon power for anticipatory political protection.\
\
3. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris publicly declared the Equal Rights Amendment to be law despite lack of ratification (2025-01-20): Biden and Harris\'92s assertion that the ERA was already law, contrary to the Archivist\'92s position, blurred constitutional procedure and highlighted tensions between symbolic commitments to equality and adherence to formal amendment processes.\
\
4. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second term and delivered a populist inaugural address (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s second inauguration and rhetoric about liberation, weaponized justice, and a rigged 2020 election framed his return to power as redress against institutions, setting a confrontational tone toward oversight and prior accountability efforts.\
\
5. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency at the US\uc0\u8209 Mexico border and ordered military involvement (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s border emergency declarations enabled troop deployments and wall construction despite low crossings, expanding emergency powers into routine immigration policy and sidestepping normal legislative budgeting and oversight channels.\
\
6. President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency to accelerate fossil fuel development (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s national energy emergency orders fast\uc0\u8209 tracked fossil fuel projects and rolled back climate safeguards, using emergency framing to weaken environmental review and shift long\u8209 term energy policy by decree rather than legislation.\
\
7. President Donald Trump issued an order ending federal recognition of birthright citizenship for many US\uc0\u8209 born children (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s executive order redefining birthright citizenship attempted to override the Fourteenth Amendment by executive fiat, directly challenging constitutional guarantees of equal citizenship and inviting immediate judicial and state resistance.\
\
8. President Donald Trump ordered sweeping immigration crackdowns including suspending asylum and refugee admissions (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s early immigration orders suspended asylum and refugee programs, expanded expedited removals, and framed migration as an invasion, sharply curtailing humanitarian protections and concentrating discretion in executive and enforcement agencies.\
\
9. President Donald Trump issued mass pardons and commutations for January 6 defendants and ordered related cases dropped (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s sweeping clemency for over 1,500 January 6 participants, coupled with directives to dismiss pending prosecutions, removed legal consequences for an attack on the transfer of power and signaled tolerance for future political violence.\
\
10. President Donald Trump pardoned anti\uc0\u8209 abortion activists convicted under the FACE Act (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s pardons for FACE Act violators removed penalties for obstructing access to reproductive health clinics, weakening deterrence for targeted harassment and signaling executive sympathy for lawbreaking aligned with his abortion stance.\
\
11. President Donald Trump restored the federal death penalty and urged aggressive capital prosecutions (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s order reinstating federal executions and pressing DOJ to seek death sentences, including in politically salient categories, expanded the most severe state punishment and invited politicization of charging decisions.\
\
12. President Donald Trump directed investigations into alleged weaponization and censorship by the prior administration (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s orders empowering DOJ and intelligence leaders to probe supposed weaponization and censorship by Biden officials repurposed investigative machinery toward political score\uc0\u8209 settling, risking chilled independence in law enforcement and intelligence.\
\
13. President Donald Trump revoked security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s blanket revocation of clearances for former intelligence leaders who criticized his 2020 claims punished perceived disloyalty and politicized access to classified information, undermining norms of nonpartisan national security expertise.\
\
14. President Donald Trump reclassified thousands of federal employees into an at\uc0\u8209 will political category (2025-01-20): By reinstating and expanding Schedule F, Trump made tens of thousands of policy\u8209 influencing civil servants easier to fire, eroding merit protections and enabling ideological purges across the executive branch.\
\
15. President Donald Trump ordered independent regulatory agencies to align policies and budgets with White House approval (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s directive subordinating independent regulators\'92 agendas and budgets to presidential review weakened statutory independence designed to insulate economic and safety regulation from direct partisan control.\
\
16. President Donald Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency under direct White House control (2025-01-20): Creating DOGE inside the Executive Office centralized cross\uc0\u8209 agency tech and process authority under presidential aides and Elon Musk, shifting operational leverage from career management structures toward a politically directed, quasi\u8209 private hub.\
\
17. President Donald Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan and redirected maritime resources to migration control (2025-01-21): Trump\'92s removal of the Coast Guard\'92s first female commandant over DEI concerns and redeployment of assets toward migrant interdiction mixed ideological purging of military leadership with expanded security roles in immigration enforcement.\
\
18. President Donald Trump ordered the military to treat border security as a core mission and deployed additional troops (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s orders assigning Northern Command a border\uc0\u8209 security mission and sending thousands of active\u8209 duty troops and Marines to the southern border blurred lines between military and civilian roles in domestic enforcement.\
\
19. President Donald Trump froze DOJ civil rights enforcement and halted new civil rights filings (2025-01-23): Trump\'92s freeze on Justice Department civil rights cases paused federal enforcement against discrimination, weakening a key institutional check on abuses by governments and private actors.\
\
20. President Donald Trump fired the TSA administrator and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee (2025-01-23): By abruptly removing TSA leadership and its external advisory body, Trump disrupted established aviation security governance and concentrated decision\uc0\u8209 making within his appointees at a critical safety agency.\
\
21. President Donald Trump fired inspectors general at multiple major federal agencies in a broad purge (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s removal of at least a dozen agency inspectors general without standard notice requirements stripped internal watchdogs across government, sharply weakening institutional self\uc0\u8209 policing and congressional oversight capacity.\
\
22. President Donald Trump threatened to prosecute former President Joe Biden (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s public suggestion that Biden could face prosecution signaled willingness to use criminal law against a predecessor, heightening fears of retaliatory justice and erosion of norms protecting former leaders from politicized charges.\
\
23. President Donald Trump delegated broad implementation of his executive orders to the attorney general (2025-01-23): Trump\'92s instruction that the incoming attorney general operationalize his sweeping executive orders further entwined DOJ leadership with the president\'92s political agenda, risking reduced independence in legal interpretations and enforcement priorities.\
\
24. President Donald Trump announced intent to abolish or radically shrink FEMA and politicize disaster aid (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s repeated threats to abolish or restructure FEMA and tie disaster relief to political or policy compliance signaled a move toward using emergency assistance as leverage over states rather than as neutral public protection.\
\
25. President Donald Trump threatened to withhold California wildfire aid unless the state met political demands (2025-01-24): Trump\'92s linkage of wildfire relief to California\'92s adoption of voter ID and water policy changes used disaster aid as a bargaining chip, undermining principles of impartial federal support to disaster\uc0\u8209 stricken populations.\
\
26. President Donald Trump signed orders enforcing the Hyde Amendment and reinstating the global gag rule on abortion funding (2025-01-24): By tightening bans on federal abortion funding domestically and abroad, Trump used executive power to narrow reproductive health access and reverse prior protections, shifting sensitive rights policy without new legislation.\
\
27. President Donald Trump issued an executive order defining legal sex as strictly male or female from conception (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s gender\uc0\u8209 definition order directed agencies to treat sex as binary and determined at conception, dismantling prior gender identity protections and embedding contested fetal personhood concepts into federal policy.\
\
28. President Donald Trump announced broad rollbacks of transgender rights in the military, sports, and healthcare (2025-01-21): Trump\'92s plans to bar transgender people from military service, women\'92s sports, and youth gender\uc0\u8209 affirming care signaled a coordinated use of executive and regulatory tools to curtail protections for a specific minority group.\
\
29. President Donald Trump ordered elimination of all federal DEI programs and offices (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s DEI abolition orders shut down diversity offices, revoked equity\uc0\u8209 focused directives, and required reporting on DEI spending, dismantling institutional mechanisms meant to address discrimination within the federal workforce and contracting.\
\
30. President Donald Trump froze funding for Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act projects (2025-01-23): Trump\'92s suspension of disbursements for major climate and infrastructure laws halted long\uc0\u8209 term investments authorized by Congress, asserting executive control over appropriated funds and raising separation\u8209 of\u8209 powers concerns.\
\
31. President Donald Trump ordered HHS, CDC, and FDA to halt health advisories and external communications (2025-01-21): Trump\'92s communication freezes at key health agencies curtailed public access to scientific information and outbreak guidance, subordinating health transparency to political control during ongoing public health risks.\
\
32. President Donald Trump directed DOJ to target sanctuary jurisdictions and resistant local officials (2025-01-22): DOJ guidance under Trump to investigate and potentially charge state and local officials resisting mass deportations escalated federal pressure on subnational governments, chilling local policy autonomy on immigration.\
\
33. President Donald Trump ordered a review council to scrutinize FEMA\'92s performance and impartiality (2025-01-24): Trump\'92s FEMA Review Council, framed around alleged bias and incompetence, created a vehicle to reshape or weaken the disaster agency\'92s structure, potentially paving the way for politicized changes in emergency management.\
\
34. President Donald Trump issued an order overriding California water and environmental rules to reroute supplies (2025-01-24): Trump\'92s California water order directed federal agencies to circumvent state policies and expedite projects, asserting federal authority over contested resources and weakening negotiated environmental protections.\
\
35. President Donald Trump launched a personal cryptocurrency and promoted it while in office (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s launch and promotion of the $TRUMP memecoin as president created a direct financial vehicle tied to his political brand, blurring lines between public office and private enrichment and opening opaque channels for influence.\
\
36. President Donald Trump publicly demanded the Federal Reserve lower interest rates (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s pressure on the Fed chair to cut rates asserted presidential preferences over an institution designed to be independent, risking politicization of monetary policy and undermining confidence in technocratic decision\uc0\u8209 making.\
\
37. President Donald Trump removed and reassigned senior Justice Department national security and criminal officials (2025-01-21): Trump\'92s reshuffling of top DOJ career leaders in key divisions weakened institutional continuity and signaled a drive to align sensitive prosecutorial and national security functions more closely with his political agenda.\
\
38. President Donald Trump sidelined about 160 National Security Council career staffers (2025-01-22): Trump\'92s sidelining of NSC career experts reduced professional input into foreign and security policy, concentrating influence among loyalists and outside figures and weakening institutional memory in crisis decision\uc0\u8209 making.\
\
39. President Donald Trump fired the TSA and Coast Guard leaders and surged maritime resources for migration control (2025-01-23): Coordinated removals of transportation and maritime security chiefs, paired with migration\uc0\u8209 focused redeployments, reoriented security institutions toward Trump\'92s immigration priorities while displacing experienced leadership.\
\
\
### Institutions and Governance\
\
1. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s renewed withdrawal from the Paris accord removed the US from a central climate governance framework, weakening multilateral coordination and signaling that major policy reversals can occur by executive action alone.\
\
2. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s order to exit the WHO and halt funding pulled the US out of a key global health institution, undermining cooperative disease surveillance and response mechanisms built over decades.\
\
3. President Donald Trump rescinded 78 Biden\uc0\u8209 era executive actions and related policies (2025-01-20): Trump\'92s blanket rescission of dozens of Biden orders on equity, climate, COVID\u8209 19, and LGBTQ+ protections showed how much federal policy can swing with presidential turnover, stressing the fragility of governance built mainly on EOs.\
