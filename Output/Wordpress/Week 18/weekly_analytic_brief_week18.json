  "summary": "This week delivers a concentrated surge of structural pressure toward authoritarian governance, anchored in three domains: a sweeping redistribution of fiscal power upward, aggressive weaponization of immigration and law enforcement, and a coordinated assault on independent institutions. Passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and related budget maneuvers hardwire inequality into tax and spending structures, slash Medicaid and SNAP, and massively expand deportation and detention capacity, entrenching traits 32, 36, and 37. Simultaneously, the administration normalizes impunity for January 6 offenders while pursuing protesters, immigrants, and oversight-minded officials, deepening traits 4, 6, 9, and 41. Executive and judicial moves\u2014TPS termination, dismantling of consent decrees, politicized appointments, and Supreme Court stays empowering presidential control over independent agencies\u2014erode checks and civil service neutrality (traits 1, 14, 22, 38). Information control and narrative warfare\u2014from mandated election lies in Oklahoma schools to press intimidation and foreign-influence scandals\u2014further degrade truth infrastructure (traits 52, 53, 55, 60). Courts and some state actors do push back on specific excesses, but the net effect is a major weekly ratchet toward a unitary, patronage-driven state with stratified citizenship and hollowed social protections.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Fiscal architecture as regime weapon: The tax-and-spend megabill, SNAP and Medicaid cuts, and immigration-fee funding model shift resources to elites while structurally disciplining the poor, sick, and immigrants.",
    "Law as asymmetric tool: Mass pardons for January 6 rioters, RICO against protesters, selective prosecutions, and dismantling of police-reform decrees show criminal law shielding allies and targeting opponents.",
    "Administrative state capture and downsizing: DOGE-driven agency gutting, VA and CFPB rollbacks, civil rights resignations, and court fights over independent boards reveal a concerted effort to politicize or hollow federal capacity.",
    "Immigration as control and spectacle: TPS revocation, mass detention funding, deportations to unsafe or third countries, Harvard visa revocations, and racialized refugee preferences stratify legal status and normalize rights violations.",
    "Information and education manipulation: Mandated election conspiracies in schools, narrative control from DHS and State, press restrictions at the Pentagon, and corporate DEI erasure degrade shared facts and civic literacy."
