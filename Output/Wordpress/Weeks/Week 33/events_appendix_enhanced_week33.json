The protest, which occurred on June 11, involved damage to a government van, but Mavalwalla was not arrested at the scene. He faces up to six years in prison if convicted. His arrest has sparked outrage among veterans and human rights advocates, who view it as an attack on peaceful dissent and civil rights.",
