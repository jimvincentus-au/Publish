\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 2 of Trump\'92s second term did not hinge on a single spectacle but on a dense sequence of firings, orders, and legal clashes that reoriented the state. The Democracy Clock inched from 7:38 to 7:39 p.m., a one\uc0\u8209 minute move that understates the structural shift. Inspectors general were purged across major departments, Democratic labor and civil\u8209 rights commissioners were fired, and civil servants were pushed toward a Schedule F\'96style loyalty regime through mass \'93deferred resignation\'94 offers and probationary status. Law enforcement was reshaped as prosecutors and FBI officials tied to Trump and January 6 cases were removed, while mass pardons and database deletions recast insurrectionists as patriots. Simultaneously, citizenship was stratified through an attempted end to birthright citizenship, TPS revocations, the Laken Riley Act, and Guant\'e1namo\u8209 based migrant detention. Information and memory were curated by scrubbing climate and DEI content, reviving patriotic curricula, and pressuring independent media. Courts and civil society mounted real, if partial, resistance, but the week\'92s through\u8209 line was consolidation of power behind a loyalty test.\
