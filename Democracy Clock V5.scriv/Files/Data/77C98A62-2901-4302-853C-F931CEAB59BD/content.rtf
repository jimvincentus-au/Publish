\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 20 is a study in consolidation rather than rupture. The Democracy Clock holds at 7:51 p.m., yet the architecture of a stratified democracy grows more defined. In Congress, the House advances the \'93Big, Beautiful Bill,\'94 extending tax cuts while slashing Medicaid, food aid, housing, and disaster preparedness, and carving bespoke protections for a foreign-owned mine shielded from public lawsuits. Parallel moves on a Trump-linked stablecoin and the GENIUS Act entwine policy with donor and family financial interests. The executive branch widens travel bans, targets Harvard\'92s foreign students, and unleashes aggressive ICE raids backed by National Guard and Marines, while a union leader is arrested in an immigration sweep. Courts offer scattered relief to migrants and speakers, but the Supreme Court\'92s shadow-docket orders empower Doge, a Musk-led entity, to mine Social Security data and displace neutral civil servants. Cuts to FEMA, NOAA, VA care, and reproductive protections hollow the safety state even as surveillance, policing, and information control deepen.\
