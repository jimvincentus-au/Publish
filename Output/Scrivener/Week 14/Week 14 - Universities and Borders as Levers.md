Week 14: Universities and Borders as Levers
A near-still Democracy Clock masks a week in which the White House tightened control over courts, campuses, and civil rights while testing the limits of law.
The fourteenth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single order or speech. It unfolded instead as a dense layering of moves that tightened control over institutions, narrowed who could rely on the law, and blurred the line between public power and private interest. The pattern was not new, but its reach widened. Universities, courts, civil-rights frameworks, and the civil service all found themselves pulled into a common orbit: comply, or be punished.
At the start of Week 14, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:57 p.m. It ended the week at the same public time, with a net movement of 0.2 minutes. On the surface, the display did not change. Underneath, the small shift captured a week in which the executive branch pressed harder against legal limits, used money and regulation to discipline opponents, and rewrote rules that once protected the vulnerable. Courts and civil society answered in places, but the balance of power moved further toward a presidency that treats oversight as optional and law as a tool.
The sharpest edge of that clash appeared in immigration. For months, the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, wrongfully deported to El Salvador, had wound its way through the courts. This week, trial and appellate judges, backed by a unanimous Supreme Court, ordered the administration to facilitate his return and examined whether officials should be held in contempt for noncompliance. On paper, the rulings were clear: the executive had violated the law and must repair the harm. In practice, the president signaled he would ignore the Supreme Court’s order, turning a single deportation case into a test of whether judicial commands still bind the White House.
Congressional Democrats tried to fill the gap. A delegation traveled to El Salvador, met with García, and spoke publicly about his case and the administration’s defiance. Their trip did not change the president’s stance, but it showed legislators using oversight travel and media to defend both an individual and the authority of the courts. The scene—members of Congress abroad, urging compliance with a Supreme Court order their own government was resisting—captured how far the separation of powers had drifted from its usual channels.
The same week, the Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelan detainees under the Alien Enemies Act, insisting that removals pause while the legality of this expansive use of an old statute was reviewed. A federal judge in California blocked the administration from withholding funds from sanctuary jurisdictions, rejecting an attempt to coerce local immigration policy through fiscal threats. On the docket, these were routine exercises of judicial review. In context, they were acts of resistance against an executive that had already shown a willingness to treat adverse rulings as suggestions.
On the ground, immigration enforcement grew harsher and less reliable. Border Patrol, ICE, and CBP wrongfully detained multiple U.S. citizens, people who could prove their status but were nonetheless swept into custody. A Milwaukee judge was arrested and charged with obstruction over actions related to an ICE arrest, signaling that local officials who resisted aggressive deportation tactics could themselves become targets. The administration considered, then stepped back from, invoking the Insurrection Act at the southern border, a near-miss that underscored how extraordinary domestic military powers now sit within reach. Together, these episodes described a system in which the law’s formal protections remained, but their force depended increasingly on the president’s willingness to honor them.
If immigration courts were one front, universities were another. The week opened with the administration cutting and freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard University and threatening its tax-exempt status. The message was blunt: change your governance and response to campus protest, or lose core funding and fiscal privileges. An antisemitism taskforce layered on conditions, tying restoration of money to measures like mask bans and expanded arrest powers at protests. Security language provided the cover; the effect was to make continued dissent financially and legally costly.
Executive orders followed. One targeted higher-education accreditation, pressing accreditors to treat diversity, equity, and inclusion standards as suspect and to reframe “equity ideology” as a threat to quality. Another bundled foreign-funding transparency requirements with selective support for historically Black colleges and universities, while attacking DEI-linked programs. On their face, these moves spoke the language of accountability and merit. In practice, they inserted federal ideology into the criteria that determine which institutions can grant recognized degrees and receive federal aid.
Universities did not accept this quietly. Harvard and other plaintiffs filed lawsuits challenging the withdrawal of education and relief funds as unlawful, arguing that the executive could not unilaterally rewrite the terms of congressionally appropriated programs. More than 150 college and university presidents signed a joint statement denouncing federal interference in higher education as unprecedented overreach. Their words carried institutional weight, but they were issued under duress: grants frozen, tax status threatened, and students detained.
Immigration tools were woven into this pressure. In Florida, the administration and state officials pushed universities and campus-linked law enforcement into ICE’s 287(g) program, effectively turning local officers into federal immigration agents and making international students more vulnerable to deportation over minor infractions. Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk was detained in harsh conditions without criminal charges, prompting congressional calls for her release and raising fears that immigration custody was being used to intimidate campus activists. Across the country, more than 700 demonstrations organized by the 50501 movement protested deportations and administration policies. Campuses served as both targets of federal leverage and hubs of civic resistance.
Beneath these visible confrontations, the legal architecture of civil rights shifted. The president signed an executive order eliminating disparate-impact liability from federal civil-rights enforcement. For decades, disparate impact had allowed plaintiffs to challenge policies that disproportionately harmed protected groups, even without proof of explicit intent. Its removal narrowed the tools available to fight systemic discrimination, especially in housing, education, and employment, and signaled a federal government less interested in outcomes than in formal neutrality.
At the same time, Congress and the administration moved to cut deeply into Medicaid and disability-related services. Republican lawmakers advanced plans to reduce the federal share of Medicaid expansion funding and proposed cutting the program by nearly a third over the next decade. The Department of Health and Human Services, under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., proposed major reductions in disability-related education, research, and support services. Together, these moves threatened millions of disabled and low-income people with reduced access to care and support, not as a byproduct of crisis but as a deliberate fiscal choice.
Disability policy became a site of surveillance as well as austerity. HHS halted autism research tied to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, narrowing the kinds of questions scientists could ask about disparities and inclusive practices. At the same time, the National Institutes of Health began collecting private medical records from multiple databases for an autism study, and HHS planned a large-scale registry tracking autistic Americans using federal and commercial health records. These steps raised sharp privacy concerns for a stigmatized group, suggesting a future in which disabled people were more closely tracked even as their supports were cut.
Environmental justice suffered a parallel blow. The administration terminated a civil-rights settlement that had required Alabama to address raw sewage pollution in majority-Black Lowndes County, removing a federal lever that had begun to remedy long-standing health hazards. Officials rebranded the agreement as an “illegal DEI initiative,” folding it into the broader campaign against diversity programs. The residents remained with failing septic systems and exposure to disease; the legal memory of their struggle was recast as ideological excess.
Immigration and detention policy tied these threads together. The administration closed two key oversight offices for immigration detention: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the detention ombudsman. These bodies had provided channels for complaints about healthcare, abuse, and conditions in facilities where the state holds people by force. Their elimination stripped detainees of institutional advocates and made it harder for Congress, courts, or the public to see inside the system.
On the enforcement side, patterns of wrongful detention persisted. Citizens were arrested and held by immigration authorities despite valid proof of status. Indonesian student Aditya Wahyu Harsono saw his visa revoked retroactively over an old misdemeanor and remained in custody despite family needs. Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful resident, was denied permission to attend his child’s birth and ruled eligible for deportation based on his political beliefs, blurring the line between security policy and punishment for speech. Student detentions and visa revocations, including the Florida 287(g) push and the later reversal of a policy that had revoked student visas over minor infractions, showed how quickly legal status could be weaponized and how much effort it took to claw back even partial protections.
Identity-based exclusions extended beyond immigration. The administration asked the Supreme Court to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, seeking judicial endorsement for a categorical bar that would mark a minority group as unfit for a core public institution. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a new reporting regime invited staff to flag perceived anti-Christian bias through a dedicated taskforce, privileging one religious identity within a federal agency and raising the prospect that neutral enforcement of nondiscrimination rules would give way to grievance politics. Against this backdrop, a small countercurrent emerged in Colorado, where a new law required counties to provide in-person voting access for eligible people held in jails and detention centers, modestly expanding the franchise for a group often effectively disenfranchised by custody.
Inside the executive branch, the machinery of administration was being rewired. At the Department of the Interior, Secretary Doug Burgum signed an order consolidating control over personnel and budget under a politically connected assistant secretary with energy ties. This centralization reduced internal checks on public-lands management and raised constitutional questions about appointments and capture. At the State Department, Secretary Marco Rubio announced a sweeping reorganization with significant staff and bureau cuts, targeting offices focused on democracy, human rights, and global issues. The firing of USAID official Peter Marocco, a figure involved in dismantling the agency, suggested internal factional maneuvering rather than a clean restoration of development capacity.
Administrative infrastructure followed the same pattern. The administration moved to replace the SmartPay government expense card program—a functioning, in-house system—with a contract for Ramp, a private firm linked to senior allies. A core payment system for federal operations would now run through a politically connected company, raising concerns about crony contracting and the privatization of basic state functions. Overseeing much of this, formally or informally, was the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, which asserted aggressive control over federal employees through weekly reporting demands and public clashes with Cabinet officials. Allowing a private billionaire to direct staff and pressure agencies blurred the line between public authority and private influence.
Personnel rules were adjusted to make these structural changes stick. An executive order strengthened probationary periods and eased removal of federal employees, requiring agencies to affirmatively certify probationary staff and loosening constraints on dismissals. In theory, this promised accountability for poor performance. In practice, it increased executive leverage over the civil service, making it easier to purge non-loyal employees and to signal that job security depended on political alignment.
Policy outputs reflected the new alignments. The administration expanded coal mining to supply datacenters while cutting miner health and safety agencies and delaying a silica dust rule, trading worker protections for energy output. It suspended federal dairy product quality control programs after staff cuts in food safety divisions, weakening safeguards against contamination and shifting health risks onto consumers. The Department of Education abruptly ended pandemic-related school relief funding and liquidation extensions, risking the loss of nearly $3 billion in support for districts, in order to help finance extensions of 2017 tax cuts. Tariff policies drove layoffs and pessimistic outlooks at major manufacturers like Cleveland Cliffs, GM, Volvo, and Howmet Aerospace, while twelve states sued over those tariffs, arguing they fueled inflation and economic harm. Chinese importers canceled large U.S. pork orders and warned against unfavorable trade deals, underscoring how trade conflicts could be targeted at politically sensitive sectors. Treasury officials and the former president touted an expected trade deal with South Korea despite an existing free trade agreement, using symbolic announcements to claim victories that did little to alter underlying conditions.
Emergency logic became a standing justification for these choices. The president relied on an asserted “energy emergency” to direct Interior to fast-track fossil fuel and mining permits, compressing permitting timelines to 28 days and weakening environmental review and public input. A separate executive order aimed to “unleash” offshore critical minerals and resources by expediting seabed development, prioritizing strategic resource control and industry interests over environmental governance. On Earth Day, the White House promoted expanded extraction of oil, gas, and minerals on federal lands and waters as a form of stewardship, inverting the usual meaning of the day. The coal/datacenter expansion, coupled with weakened miner protections, fit the same pattern: emergency and competitiveness language used to justify long-term environmental and health harms that would be difficult to reverse.
Information about these policies, and about the state itself, grew less trustworthy. DOGE claimed $160 billion in federal spending cuts on its website, but only $12.6 billion could be verified. Official fiscal reporting became a political narrative tool rather than a transparent accounting instrument. Those inflated savings figures fed directly into fundraising emails suggesting Americans might receive $5,000 rebate checks, promises that had no basis in enacted law but were used to solicit donations and shape voter expectations. The same apparatus that managed internal data flows now served as a platform for public deception.
The president’s relationship with independent information sources deteriorated further. The White House dismissed credible reporting that it was searching for a new Secretary of Defense as “fake news,” contributing to confusion about defense leadership and eroding trust in media. After the Supreme Court blocked deportations, the president attacked judges on social media, blaming predecessors for current problems and seeking to delegitimize judicial checks. He called on Rupert Murdoch to fire Fox News’s pollster after an unfavorable approval rating, signaling intolerance for independent measures of public opinion and encouraging partisan control over data.
Security norms inside the Pentagon frayed in parallel. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of U.S. military strikes in Yemen in private Signal chats that included family and associates, bypassing established channels for handling defense secrets. He had an unsecured “dirty line” installed in his Pentagon office to access blocked sites, circumventing security protocols in a secure facility. The Pentagon inspector general opened an investigation into his use of Signal and handling of classified information, testing whether watchdogs could enforce rules against a senior political appointee. Hegseth responded by publicly threatening criminal prosecutions of former Defense employees accused of leaking information, a warning that risked chilling internal whistleblowing even as his own conduct was under review.
Media institutions faced direct pressure. The administration shut down Voice of America and related news services, congressionally mandated broadcasters, until a federal judge ordered their restoration, reaffirming that the executive could not unilaterally abolish agencies created and funded by Congress. At the same time, the president issued a memorandum directing the attorney general to investigate ActBlue, a major opposition fundraising platform, for alleged foreign and straw donations. The order rested on disputed factual claims and risked weaponizing federal law enforcement against political rivals, blending legal process with partisan narrative.
Against this backdrop, some institutions still held lines. A federal judge blocked the president’s order adding a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, protecting congressional control over election rules and preventing a change that could have disenfranchised many eligible voters. Another judge ordered the restoration of Voice of America, as noted, reinforcing separation of powers. A federal jury ruled against Sarah Palin in her retrial against the New York Times, reaffirming the “actual malice” standard and preserving robust press protections under the First Amendment. Courts secured a major opioid settlement with Walgreens over unlawful prescription filling, highlighting that some corporate health harms still drew significant penalties, even if resolved through civil payments rather than criminal convictions.
In the realm of political accountability, a federal court sentenced former Representative George Santos to prison on fraud and identity theft charges related to donor funds and personal enrichment. The custodial sentence showed that at least some elite financial crimes faced real punishment, modestly countering the broader pattern of impunity. Colorado’s jail voting law, the routine regulatory work of agencies like OSHA, the DEA, and the Federal Election Commission, and ongoing technical standards updates in areas like workplace safety and controlled-substance licensing all represented the quieter maintenance of democratic infrastructure. These actions did not reverse the week’s broader drift, but they demonstrated that tools for constraint and repair remained available where structure and will aligned.
The week closed without a single dramatic rupture. Its significance lay in the way familiar methods were applied with greater confidence and reach. Courts could still issue injunctions, and sometimes did. Universities could still sue, and did. Protesters could still march, and they did so in the hundreds of thousands. Yet each of these acts of resistance took place in an environment where executive power was more centralized, oversight offices were fewer, civil-rights doctrines were narrower, and information from the state was less reliable.
In that sense, Week 14 deepened the erosion rather than marking a new break. Executive defiance of court orders, the use of funding and accreditation to discipline universities, the dismantling of disparate-impact enforcement, and the capture and outsourcing of administrative agencies all pushed the system further from a model in which law limits power and closer to one in which power chooses which laws to heed. The Democracy Clock’s near-stillness at 7:57 p.m. captured that paradox: little visible movement in time, and yet a steady, accumulating loss in what institutions can guarantee to those who depend on them.
