    "Executive branch: Expands its reach through emergency tariff orders, coal and energy deregulatory EOs, retaliatory actions against law firms and critics, and militarization of the border, deepening a presidency that governs by decree.",
    "Judiciary: Delivers mixed signals\u2014Supreme Court greenlights Alien Enemies Act deportations and blocks rehiring of purged civil servants, yet enforces AP access and orders Abrego Garcia\u2019s return\u2014revealing both pockets of resistance and deference.",
    "Congress: Shows fragmented oversight; some bipartisan efforts to reclaim tariff authority and protect elections coexist with House Republican rule changes, the SAVE Act, and the No Rogue Rulings Act, which collectively weaken checks on the executive.",
    "Civil service and agencies: NOAA, FDA, SSA, IRS, and scientific grant-making bodies are hollowed out or repurposed, while DOGE and private contractors assume growing roles in deportations and data operations, undermining neutral administration.",
    "Universities and civil society: Major universities, law school clinics, and advocacy groups are chilled by funding threats and investigations, even as large-scale protests and targeted lawsuits demonstrate ongoing, but embattled, civic resistance."

    "The administration\u2019s open defiance and delay in complying with Supreme Court orders in the Abrego Garcia case raises unresolved questions about whether courts can practically enforce constraints on executive immigration power.",
    "Corporate America\u2019s near-total silence on tariffs, despite massive market losses, suggests either unprecedented fear of retaliation or alignment with aspects of the agenda; the balance between intimidation and complicity remains unclear.",
    "The partial restoration of Harriet Tubman content and some USAID contracts hints at internal pushback within the bureaucracy\u2014how far such micro-reversals can go against a coordinated anti-DEI and anti-science campaign is uncertain."

  "summary": "This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive power, with Trump using emergency tariff authorities, immigration law, and executive orders to bypass Congress and punish perceived enemies. The tariff shock and chaotic partial pause exemplify governance by economic brinkmanship, offloading risk onto the public while insiders maneuver around the volatility. Immigration policy hardens into a mass-deportation regime: TPS holders, asylum seekers, students, and even legal residents are detained or expelled under dubious legal theories, while the IRS and Palantir data are repurposed to feed enforcement. Simultaneously, universities, law firms, NGOs, and cultural institutions are brought to heel through funding freezes, consent decrees, and retaliatory orders, eroding independent centers of knowledge and legal defense. Voting rights come under direct attack via the SAVE Act and targeted challenges to military and overseas ballots. There is some institutional resistance\u2014federal judges protect AP access, block certain immigration terminations, and order Abrego Garcia\u2019s return; Congress introduces bills to claw back tariff power; mass protests and civic mobilization continue\u2014but the net structural pressure is strongly toward normalized emergency rule, weaponized law, and a stratified citizenship regime.",
  "top_themes": [
    "Normalization of emergency economic rule: sweeping tariffs imposed via emergency powers, chaotic reversals, and House rule changes collectively sideline Congress and embed one-man control over trade and macroeconomic risk.",
    "Immigration as a central tool of authoritarian control: mass detentions, wrongful deportations, visa revocations, data-sharing, and social media surveillance turn immigration law into a system for disciplining activists, students, and entire nationalities.",
    "Coercive capture of independent institutions: universities, law firms, NGOs, and scientific agencies face funding freezes, consent decrees, retaliatory orders, and DEI purges, shrinking autonomous spaces that could check executive power.",
    "Weaponization of the justice system: DOJ discipline of honest lawyers, targeted investigations of critics, limits on FARA enforcement, and House/Senate moves against nationwide injunctions all push courts and prosecutors toward regime service.",
    "Structured voter exclusion under the banner of integrity: the SAVE Act, North Carolina ballot challenges, and ICE\u2013DOGE data collaborations advance a model where access to the franchise is contingent, bureaucratized, and easily withdrawn."
