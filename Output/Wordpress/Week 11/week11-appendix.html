<h1>Week 11 Appendix: Chaos as Methodical Governance</h1>
<p><em>Emergency economics, bureaucratic purges, and weaponized federal leverage advanced together, deepening structural erosion even as the Democracy Clock barely moved.</em></p>
<p>This was a structurally heavy week for democratic erosion, with simultaneous blows to institutional checks, civil rights, and the information environment. The most acute pressures came from the normalization of emergency economic powers and sweeping tariffs, used to bypass Congress and rewire trade policy in ways that reward donors and punish disfavored regions. Parallel mass layoffs and politicization at HHS, EPA, USAID, and across the civil service hollowed out core state capacity, especially in public health and environmental protection. Federal power was overtly weaponized against universities, blue jurisdictions, and even a single state (Maine), while immigration tools were repurposed to target activists and vulnerable migrants using arbitrary criteria. Courts were a mixed arena: some federal judges and state AG coalitions checked deportations and election overreach, but other courts and the Supreme Court advanced partisan or anti-DEI outcomes and tolerated executive funding freezes. Media and academic freedom came under coordinated pressure via FCC investigations, access bans, Smithsonian interference, and funding threats to Columbia and Harvard. Against this backdrop, large-scale protests, Cory Booker’s marathon speech, and electoral pushback in Wisconsin signaled significant, but still outmatched, democratic resistance.</p>
<h3>Power and Authority</h3>
<ol>
<li>Trump administration canceled $400 million in federal funding to Columbia University to pressure changes in campus policies: By pulling major research funding to force Columbia to change how it handles pro-Palestinian activity, the administration used federal financial power to shape academic speech and institutional autonomy. (2025-03-29)</li>
<li>Columbia University adopted new restrictions on pro-Palestinian activity and ceded control over a department under federal pressure: Columbia’s decision to tighten protest rules and accept external control of a department in hopes of regaining federal funds showed how executive pressure can chill campus dissent and reshape governance.

<li>Trump administration implemented budget cuts that weakened Native American institutions and tribal funding: Cuts to tribal funds and Native-serving institutions, including Haskell Indian Nations University, reduced support for Indigenous education and cultural programs, weakening already marginalized communities’ access to public goods. (2025-03-29)</li>
<li>Trump administration issued an executive order directing the Smithsonian to remove exhibits deemed “improper, divisive or anti-American”: Ordering the Smithsonian to purge exhibits on race and power placed federal ideology over curatorial judgment, letting the executive branch rewrite public history and constrain discussion of racism.

(2025-03-30)</li>
<li>President Trump warned automakers not to raise prices in response to new auto tariffs: Directly pressuring private firms on pricing signaled a willingness to use presidential influence to manage markets informally, blurring lines between state authority and private decision-making.

(2025-04-02)</li>
<li>President Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all imports, framed as “Liberation Day” economic policy: Announcing blanket and country-specific tariffs as a national renewal project concentrated economic power in the presidency and risked destabilizing global trade and domestic prices. (2025-04-02)</li>
<li>President Trump reached coercive settlements with major law firms to avert punitive executive orders targeting them: Conditioning avoidance of hostile executive orders on law firms’ pro bono commitments blurred the line between regulation and retaliation, pressuring legal actors who represent political opponents. (2025-04-02)</li>
<li>President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff package that exempted many fossil fuel products important to major donors: Designing tariffs to spare key fossil fuel imports after large industry donations showed how economic emergency tools can be tailored to protect benefactors while shifting costs to the public. (2025-04-03)</li>
<li>President Trump extended the enforcement delay of the TikTok ban under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act: Postponing enforcement of a high-profile app ban underscored executive control over when and how national-security-based tech restrictions actually bite, affecting platforms and users’ speech environment.
