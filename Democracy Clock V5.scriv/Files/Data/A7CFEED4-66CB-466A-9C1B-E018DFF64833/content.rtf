\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Week 34 Appendix: War Logic at Home\
\
This week shows an aggressive consolidation of executive and security power, with courts and Congress increasingly enabling rather than constraining it. The Trump administration normalized military and paramilitary deployments into Democratic-led cities (DC, Chicago, Memphis) and immigration crackdowns (Hyundai raids, Operation Midway Blitz), while the Supreme Court repeatedly greenlit racial profiling and expanded presidential control over independent agencies and spending. Legislative moves\'97mandatory-minimum immigration sentencing, stripping DC\'92s budget, Senate rules easing confirmations\'97further hollowed deliberative checks. Simultaneously, federal agencies and courts advanced a hard-right social and economic agenda: cutting science and health funding, defunding Planned Parenthood and NSF grants, restricting immigrant access to services, and undercutting environmental and climate programs. Information control and memory politics intensified around Epstein, Charlie Kirk\'92s assassination, and immigration, with disinformation, secrecy, and symbolic glorification used to frame dissent as treasonous and to sanctify regime-aligned figures. There were pockets of resistance\'97state-level social programs, some protective court rulings, and large protests\'97but structurally the week entrenched authoritarian-style governance across security, immigration, economic regulation, and civic space.\

\
3.

\
5. President Donald Trump deployed approximately 2,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC and took control of the city\'92s police department (2025-09-06): Federalizing local policing and stationing troops in the capital shifted everyday public order from civilian to military-style control, weakening local self-governance.\
\

\
11. Trump administration ordered the destruction of nearly $10 million in contraceptives intended for low-income countries (2025-09-09): Destroying donated contraceptives curtailed reproductive health support abroad, using executive control over aid supplies to advance ideological goals at the expense of vulnerable populations.\

\
19. President Donald Trump announced a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom for Charlie Kirk (2025-09-10): Awarding the nation\'92s highest civilian honor posthumously to a polarizing activist used state decoration to elevate a partisan figure and shape national symbols around movement allies.\

Institutions and Governance\
\

\
2.

\
3. Department of Justice delayed responding to an Epstein-related FOIA request until November 2027 (2025-09-07): Pushing a key records request nearly three years into the future effectively denied timely public scrutiny of government handling of a high-profile abuse case.\

House Speaker Mike Johnson first suggested and then retracted a claim that Donald Trump had been an FBI informant in the Epstein case (2025-09-07): Issuing and walking back an unfounded claim about Trump\'92s role in the Epstein investigation showed senior leadership using sensitive law-enforcement narratives for political positioning.\

\

\
10. U.S. Supreme Court upheld an $83.3 million defamation verdict against Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll case (2025-09-08): Affirming that presidential immunity does not shield defamatory conduct reinforced that even presidents can be held civilly liable for personal attacks.\

\
14. U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump\'92s appeal on the legality of his global tariffs and kept them in place (2025-09-08): Taking up the tariff case while allowing contested duties to continue preserved the status quo of expansive executive trade power pending final review.\
\
15. U.S. Supreme Court temporarily allowed President Trump to withhold nearly $5 billion in foreign aid appropriated by Congress (2025-09-09): Letting a pocket rescission stand during appeal weakened Congress\'92s power of the purse and enabled executive non-spending of duly appropriated democracy and peacekeeping funds.\
\
