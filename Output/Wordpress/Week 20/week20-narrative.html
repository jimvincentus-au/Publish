<h1>Week 20: Surveillance as Everyday Governance</h1>
<p><em>In a week of near-still clock time, immigration raids, data centralization, and partisan clemency showed power consolidating quietly inside a more permissive order.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The most dangerous moment is not when the law is broken, but when it is obeyed in a new spirit. — Anonymous legal scholar</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Liberty is rarely lost in a single stroke; it is surrendered in a series of reasonable measures. — Adapted from historical warnings</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The test of a free society is not whether it holds elections, but whether it can endure dissent without calling it a threat. — Civic reflection</p></blockquote>
<p>The twentieth week of Trump’s second term did not hinge on a single rupture. It unfolded as a dense layering of moves that, taken together, showed a regime no longer testing the edges of the system but operating inside a new, more permissive understanding of what power could do. Immigration raids, budget bills, court orders, and symbolic gestures all pointed in the same direction: a state that sorted people by origin and loyalty, rewarded insiders, and treated dissent as a security problem. The pattern was not subtle. It was steady.</p>
<p>At the close of Week 19, the Democracy Clock stood at 7:59 p.m. It ended Week 20 at the same public time, with a net movement of 0.1 minutes. On the surface, the clock appeared to hold. In substance, it registered a further, if slight, erosion in democratic safety. The small shift reflected the fact that many of this week’s actions deepened trajectories already underway rather than opening new fronts. Courts that had been drifting toward deference moved a little further. Immigration enforcement that was already harsh became more openly political. Surveillance that had been expanding gained new tools. The week’s danger lay less in novelty than in consolidation.</p>
<p>The most visible expression of that consolidation came in immigration enforcement, which slid decisively into the realm of political control. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security carried out aggressive raids that swept up not only targeted individuals but also “collateral” detainees at workplaces and check-ins. Record arrest sweeps and warrantless detentions turned status into a standing vulnerability. For noncitizens and mixed-status families, daily life became a landscape of risk. The law still spoke in the language of enforcement and public safety. Its practical effect was to make whole communities easier to intimidate.</p>
<p>That intimidation was not confined to the margins. In Washington, federal agents from the Federal Protective Service and ICE entered Representative Jerry Nadler’s office on the pretext of a safety check and handcuffed a staffer. The incident blurred the line between building security and political pressure on a senior opposition lawmaker. In California, SEIU state president David Huerta was arrested during an immigration raid, with official accounts later contradicted by video evidence. These episodes showed enforcement spilling into the domestic political sphere, sending a message that even elected officials and union leaders were not insulated from the machinery of raids and cuffs.</p>
<p>On campuses and in the streets, immigration status became a lever against dissent. A student who had written a Gaza op-ed was arrested and treated as a security threat. Pro‑Palestinian protesters faced detention under immigration pretexts. When anti‑deportation demonstrations in Los Angeles grew, the administration deployed National Guard units and Marines to help suppress what were largely peaceful protests. The choice to bring military forces into a domestic protest context marked a sharp turn. Dissent was no longer just policed; it was treated as a quasi‑insurgent challenge warranting armed response.</p>
<p>The legal tools used against individual activists grew more obscure and more severe. Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was detained under a rarely used statute, prompting a constitutional challenge. The combination of archaic legal authority and contemporary political speech made the case a warning shot: the state was willing to reach deep into the legal arsenal to neutralize voices it framed as dangerous. At the same time, structural changes hardened the landscape. The Supreme Court allowed the administration to end humanitarian paroles for roughly half a million people, and the White House created an Office of Remigration to promote returns rather than protection. Sweeping travel bans and institution‑specific visa suspensions, including restrictions on foreign students at Harvard, centralized control over who could enter or study in the country. A few lower‑court rulings ordered deportees returned or removals halted, especially for families and LGBTQ asylum seekers. These were pockets of resistance against a broader architecture that now treated origin and ideology as grounds for diminished rights.</p>
<p>If immigration enforcement showed how the state could sort and punish, the courts and executive orders showed how it could see and control. The Supreme Court upheld Trump’s firing of National Labor Relations Board chair Gwynne Wilcox, strengthening a unitary executive theory that treats independent regulators as extensions of presidential will. In the same week, the Court lifted an injunction that had blocked the Department of Government Efficiency—an unelected, contractor‑linked unit known as Doge—from accessing Social Security data and proceeding with “efficiency” measures. These emergency stays, issued on the Court’s shadow docket, gave the administration and its private partners a green light to mine sensitive records while union and privacy challenges were still pending. The signal was clear. The president’s reach into the bureaucracy was growing.</p>
<p>Behind those orders lay a broader data project. The administration issued an executive order centralizing federal personal data using Palantir technology, building a unified infrastructure across agencies. Combined with Doge’s new access to Social Security files, this created a surveillance‑heavy state in which an opaque entity could analyze the intimate details of millions of lives under the banner of fraud detection and cost savings. The same Court that opened this door also allowed the administration to terminate large‑scale immigration paroles during litigation and agreed to hear a case that could narrow lower courts’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions in rights disputes. In other rulings, it dismissed Mexico’s suit against U.S. gunmakers, broadened religious tax exemptions, and eased reverse‑discrimination claims, signaling a bench inclined to shield industries and majority plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Lower courts did not disappear from the story. Judges in several jurisdictions blocked or corrected deportations, ordering returns for migrants wrongly removed to El Salvador and Mexico and halting removals for a gay asylum seeker and families in Colorado. The Court of International Trade ruled Trump’s blanket metal tariffs illegal, reaffirming Congress’s tariff authority, even as an appeals court stay kept the duties in place. A district judge allowed fourteen states’ lawsuit against Doge and the Social Security Administration to proceed, opening a path to review the legality of this novel outsourcing. These acts of resistance were real. They were also bounded. The decisive shifts in labor rights, data access, and immigration status came from the Supreme Court’s emergency orders and the executive’s willingness to push them.</p>
<p>While the legal architecture tilted toward deference, the White House moved to rewrite accountability itself. Trump issued blanket pardons and commutations for January 6 defendants and ordered related cases dropped. Participants in an attack on the transfer of power were recast as victims of overzealous prosecution rather than perpetrators of political violence. At the same time, the president ordered investigations into Joe Biden’s cognitive fitness and into his predecessor’s pardons and clemency decisions. A core constitutional power long used for mercy and correction was turned into a pretext for partisan scrutiny. The message was that future presidents who used clemency in ways disfavored by a successor could face retroactive investigation.</p>
<p>January 6 figures themselves joined this effort to invert the narrative. Enrique Tarrio and others filed a lawsuit challenging their prosecutions, seeking to portray enforcement as persecution. In the information sphere, Trump amplified conspiracy theories claiming that Biden had been executed and replaced by clones or robots. These fantastical claims, broadcast by a sitting president, corroded shared reality and blurred the line between satire and state narrative. On Capitol Hill, the House Oversight Committee leadership pursued partisan inquiries into Biden’s cognition and aides, while Democrats on the same committee demanded full release of Jeffrey Epstein case files from the FBI and Justice Department. Oversight became a split screen: one side aimed at delegitimizing a predecessor, the other at prying open secrecy around elite misconduct.</p>
<p>On the ground, the pattern of who faced handcuffs and who received clemency was stark. Rev. William Barber and Moral Monday protesters were arrested in the Capitol Rotunda for peaceful opposition to budget cuts in healthcare and social services. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka filed a lawsuit alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution by federal officials, arguing that criminal process had been used against a local critic. Together with the January 6 pardons, these cases illustrated a reoriented justice system. Insurrectionists were forgiven; anti‑austerity clergy and dissenting mayors were pulled into the dock.</p>
<p>Beneath these headline struggles, the administration and its congressional allies advanced a sweeping restructuring of the safety net. The House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill and a Republican budget bill that cut deeply into Medicaid, nutrition assistance, rental aid, preschool development grants, FEMA resilience programs, veterans’ care, and NOAA and NWS capacity. At the same time, the bills preserved or extended 2017‑style tax cuts and preempted state regulation of artificial intelligence. The effect was to shift resources from poor and working‑class households toward higher‑income taxpayers and corporate actors, embedding that shift in statute.</p>
<p>Targeted moves reinforced this direction. The administration proposed severe cuts to NIH and other biomedical research funding, threatening long‑term medical innovation and public health capacity. It advanced plans to shift veterans’ care from VA facilities to private providers while cutting VA jobs and contracts, moving a core public obligation toward a fragmented market model. In reproductive health, the White House ended enforcement of emergency abortion guidance under EMTALA, leaving life‑or‑death decisions in emergency rooms more exposed to state bans and local prosecutors. A West Virginia prosecutor suggested that women should report miscarriages to police under an abortion ban, deepening the sense that pregnancy outcomes could trigger criminal scrutiny. The line between health care and law enforcement grew thinner.</p>
<p>Independent analysts warned of the costs. The Congressional Budget Office and the OECD released analyses showing that Trump’s tariffs and the omnibus bill would raise deficits, slow growth, and increase the number of uninsured. Rising unemployment claims and questions about the quality of inflation data, driven by staffing shortfalls at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, added to the sense of economic stress. Yet when Senator Joni Ernst was pressed about Medicaid cuts, she minimized their impact and invoked religious language about mortality, framing the retrenchment as both manageable and morally grounded. The administration requested that Congress rescind $9.4 billion in previously appropriated funds, including for public media and foreign aid, and threatened to cancel significant federal funding and rail grants for California. Risk and austerity were pushed downward, while upside remained protected.</p>
<p>Alongside cuts, the week exposed how closely economic policy had become entwined with the fortunes of a few oligarchic actors. The GENIUS Act, advanced after heavy crypto donations, promised a regulatory blessing for stablecoins, including USD1, a Trump‑family‑linked instrument. A $2 billion investment by UAE‑owned MGX into Binance used USD1 as the vehicle, turning a private coin tied to the ruling family into a channel for foreign capital. Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report detailing Elon Musk’s wealth gains and influence over federal policy, underscoring how deeply contractors like Musk were embedded in space, data, and infrastructure decisions. Public policy and private balance sheets were increasingly hard to separate.</p>
<p>The relationship between Trump and Musk, once mutually beneficial, spilled into open feud. After Musk criticized spending bills and aspects of the administration’s agenda, Trump publicly suggested terminating Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts, including those tied to NASA and Doge. The president’s threats linked the continuation of major federal contracts to personal loyalty rather than performance. At the same time, the two men clashed over Doge’s role, ISS logistics, and media narratives, with their dispute amplified across platforms. Corporate power responded unevenly. Some firms cut ties with law firms that complied with Trump’s anti‑media order, signaling resistance to executive overreach. Others withdrew sponsorships from Pride events under political pressure, showing how business influence could also reinforce culture‑war priorities.</p>
<p>Tariff policy and industrial strategy followed the same pattern of personalized, donor‑sensitive decision‑making. Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50 percent via executive action, reshaping trade conditions with limited congressional input. His budget director, Russell Vought, signaled plans to use impoundment and executive tools to cut federal spending without full legislative approval. Meanwhile, the administration advanced policies that slowed industrial growth and reduced support for battery and EV manufacturing, leading to canceled plants and undermining domestic capacity in strategic sectors. Economic levers were wielded with little regard for long‑term stability but strong regard for political advantage and the preferences of aligned industries.</p>
<p>Information, science, and memory were not bystanders in this process; they were targets. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, political leadership required doctors and scientists to obtain clearance before publishing or speaking, effectively routing research through appointees who could suppress inconvenient findings. Critics described a “war on science” as staffing cuts and communication limits undermined evidence‑based debate about veterans’ health. The administration issued an executive order on “Restoring Gold Standard Science” that, despite its title, empowered political appointees to punish or silence disfavored research, centralizing control over what counted as authoritative evidence. The goal was not better science. It was compliant science.</p>
<p>Independent media faced parallel pressure. The White House and its allies moved to defund NPR and PBS, labeling them antithetical to American interests, and bundled those cuts into a rescission package that also targeted foreign aid. Public broadcasters responded with a lawsuit challenging Trump’s order cutting funding to allegedly biased outlets, testing whether the executive could financially punish media for perceived viewpoint bias. At the Pentagon, briefing‑room doors were locked and regular press conferences halted, reducing transparency around military policy. Economic data, too, became less reliable as BLS staffing shortages threatened the quality of inflation surveys and White House officials misrepresented deficit impacts of legislation. The informational ground under citizens’ feet grew less firm.</p>
<p>The struggle over memory and education took on a more symbolic but no less consequential form. The Department of Defense temporarily removed Jackie Robinson’s biography from its website, and Trump ordered the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships to emphasize “warrior culture,” erasing civil‑rights figures in favor of martial themes. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon testified ambiguously about whether teaching Black history and the facts of the 2020 election violated federal DEI policies, inviting self‑censorship in schools. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of promoting Chinese Communist Party priorities and student espionage without evidence, framing a leading university as a foreign influence hub. DHS published flawed lists of “noncompliant” sheriffs and sanctuary jurisdictions to shame local officials, then retracted them under pressure. These moves, taken together, showed an administration curating which histories and facts could occupy official space, and weaponizing data to coerce alignment.</p>
<p>Religion and civil rights were drawn into the same orbit. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division warned California schools that allowing trans girls in sports violated equal protection, while Trump threatened to impose large fines on the state over transgender athlete participation. Federal civil‑rights law, long used to expand inclusion, was turned against a marginalized group. In reproductive policy, the EMTALA rollback and miscarriage‑reporting rhetoric signaled a willingness to bring police and prosecutors into the most intimate corners of life. On the protest front, Moral Monday demonstrators were arrested in the Capitol, a traffic safety activist in Charlottesville was charged with vandalism for chalking a crosswalk, and a nationwide crackdown on organized retail theft showed how property crime could be policed aggressively even as political violence received clemency. The hierarchy of what the state chose to punish was on display.</p>
<p>Religious rhetoric helped justify these choices and mark out who belonged. Senator Ernst invoked Christianity when defending Medicaid cuts, framing suffering and mortality as matters of faith rather than policy design. Representative Mary Miller disparaged a Sikh prayer in Congress after misidentifying the faith of the leader, normalizing ignorance and bigotry in official discourse. In the private sector, political attacks on corporate diversity efforts contributed to withdrawals from Pride sponsorships, shrinking the visibility and funding of LGBTQ events. A bipartisan anti‑grooming law in Louisiana expanded tools against abuse but, in this climate, raised questions about how broadly such offenses might be interpreted. The net effect was to narrow who could participate fully in public life and to entangle policy with a particular religious and cultural identity.</p>
<p>All of this unfolded amid a deliberate overload of action. In the span of days, the administration doubled metal tariffs, signaled impoundment plans, issued broad cybersecurity, drone, and supersonic flight orders, launched mass immigration raids, advanced deep budget cuts, centralized data under Doge and Palantir, and broadcast conspiracies about Biden’s supposed death and replacement. Economic indicators flickered: unemployment claims rose, inflation data grew less trustworthy, and independent bodies warned of deficits and slowed growth. DHS’s shaming lists of sheriffs, later withdrawn, added noise to the enforcement picture. The volume and variety of moves strained the capacity of media, courts, and civil society to track and contest them. Structural changes in surveillance, inequality, and institutional independence hardened while attention was pulled from one crisis to the next.</p>
<p>Some countervailing forces remained. Lower courts insisted on due process in individual deportation cases. Public broadcasters went to court to defend their funding and independence. House Democrats demanded transparency on Epstein files. The National Archives invited public comment on records schedules, quietly tending to the long‑term integrity of government archives. Lawmakers like Angus King and Jamie Raskin invoked historical warnings about demagoguery and conscience, and Senator Cory Booker urged citizens to hold fearful politicians accountable. Civil society groups organized protests and legal challenges, even as some of their leaders were arrested. The guardrails bent. They did not vanish.</p>
<p>Yet the balance of the week lay with those who wielded power, not those who checked it. Executive orders and emergency stays expanded surveillance and data access faster than privacy advocates could respond. Budget bills and rescission packages moved through Congress with little genuine deliberation, hardwiring inequality and privatization into law. The Supreme Court’s emergency docket became a quiet engine of structural change, aligning with executive and corporate priorities. Immigration enforcement and policing were used to intimidate opposition and vulnerable communities, while paramilitary‑style political violence from January 6 was forgiven. The incentives were plain. Loyalty was rewarded; resistance carried rising costs.</p>
<p>In that sense, Week 20 marked not a dramatic turn but a deepening of the existing arc. Citizenship was more sharply stratified by wealth, ideology, and heritage. Law functioned more clearly as a weapon than as a limit. Surveillance grew more pervasive, even as elite dealings remained opaque. Universities, media, and scientific institutions felt the pressure to conform or lose funding and access. The system still held elections, courts still issued rulings, and protests still occurred, but the cost of using those channels rose, and the rewards for loyalty to the regime grew. The clock’s near‑stillness captured a sobering truth. The danger now lay in how normal this had begun to feel.</p>
