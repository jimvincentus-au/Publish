    "summary": "This week saw a significant escalation in the erosion of democratic norms, with multiple breaches across key moral floor traits. The administration's actions increasingly blurred the lines between public duty and personal gain, particularly through the acceptance of foreign gifts and the suggestion of suspending habeas corpus. While there were instances of judicial resistance, they were insufficient to counter the broader trends of executive overreach and the politicization of civil service and media.",

While there are signs of resistance from the judiciary and civil society, these efforts have not yet been able to counter the significant shifts occurring at the federal level.
